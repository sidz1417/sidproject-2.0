let me start off with some basics
first i did experience the import bug
what does this mean
it means that i had to spend two whole minutes of my life recreating my character to look exactly like he always had
the important stuff like the decisions stats etc all imported just fine
so if your time is so valuable that you cant spare the two minutes and could get angry enough to give this game only one starget over it then go get yourself into some anger management classes as fast as you can
you arent the president or the pope and i hate to be the one to break it to you but your time is not that valuable
now onto the game spoiler freeill start with the multiplayer which i thought was a fantastic addition to the game
surprisingly there are people upset about this additional feature
instead of just not playing the mp they are getting all worked up
what a joke
are the controls as tight as a dedicated first or third person shooter no
big deal
its still a blast to play with plenty of things to unlock and a load of characters to play that are different and give you plenty of variety
this was a good decision for ea because now folks will all buy copies so they can play with their friends rather than buying one copy playing it and passing it off to their friends
a good business decision and a way for them to increase revenue and increase enjoyment for the customer
i will point out that i dont like ea but love bioware
ea seems to have left bioware alone in terms of letting them make the kinds of games they want to make
many would disagree with that and thats their opiniongraphics dont take a huge step forward but there is a level of polish
nicely done overallthe characters from the first two games all make an appearance though may not all be useable as squadmates
while i would have liked to have seen certain characters get more screen time i cant say that this upset me too muchvoice acting for most of the characters is pretty good but the male shephard still feels as emotionless as he has in all the games despite all the scenes they inserted to try and fix this problem
its not the story its just bad voice acting on his partnice variety of weapons and armor
i liked the changes from me in this regard and i like the level of customization you can do to your armor now
another change that i didnt like in me was the lack of abilities compared to the first game
they really did a good job expanding those again for me so thank you bioware i appreciate itcontrols are pretty good most of the time though not particularly better than me
getting into and out of cover isnt smooth a lot of the time and when you are running youll often grab onto cover which can be frustrating but its not a deal breakeri like the expanded areas and functionality aboard the ship
you can do a lot more on the normandy than you could in the past which is a nice additionsome of the weapons i really didnt like even though i did like them in the previous games
it seems that they tweaked the characteristics a bit too much in some cases
some of the guns kick like crazy but didnt used to
id point out to folks that these weapons kick far less when fired from cover so bear that in mind
the incisor rifle is the perfect example of a weapon i really loved in me
it fires a three shot burst in rapid succession
in the second game there is very little recoil between shots   and  in this game after the first shot fires it kicks up so much that the second and third shots will often miss the target unless they are at point blank range
again this is mitigated somewhat by firing from cover but my guess is a lot of players will not enjoy this rifle as much
the other example is the argus assault rifle
a very heavy three round burst assault rifle with terrible terrible recoiloverall the game makes improvements on virtually all fronts
having said that this game feels darker and more depressing for obvious reasons but that is not necessarily a bad thing
and i have noticed that a great deal of folks are upsetvery upset about the ending
i havent gotten there yet so there may be an edit to my review when i get there but at this point im about half way through the game and i am very happy with it
ive seen a few minor bugs such as a few times when i am out of ammo and run over an ammo pickup and it says ammo full when i have zero all the while i have husks or cerberus troops bearing down on me
it got me killed a couple of times but it was more funny than anything else and doesnt happen oftenif you liked the first two games you should enjoy this one very much especially for those that liked the biotic characters
although i play as a soldier biotics have been given a very significant boost this time around and im glad i got to experiment with them in multiplayer
i never liked them before but have learned to appreciate them this time around
as i saidi may be back for an edit after the endreview editi had originally ranked this game  stars but after playing it all the way through and doing some more multiplayer i had to knock off two stars
heres whythe multiplayer is very fun but they implemented a couple of things very poorly
here are two examples you purchase packs that give you random things for your character new weapons weapon upgrades etc
on a number of occasions it gave me the upgrade of character training which is extra experience
the problem
my character was already at level  which means the experience goes out the window
they should have done a better job of not giving you something you couldnt even use
second it is virtually impossible to get a preferred weapon leveled up to level  why
because there are probably several dozen weapons in the game at least
each of them can be leveled to  considering you rarely get a weapon upgrade and couple that with the chances of it actually being for the weapon you want and youre in for some serious frustration
i have three different shotguns at level  and ive never even equipped them in multiplayer
they should have implemented this like they did in the campaign and it would have been much more satisfyinglastly the ending is as bad as everyone says
let me be clear on this its not because its a depressing ending i expected that
its because they are justplainbad
badly written horrible ideas horrible everything
hard to believe it was bioware
your choices from the games have virtually no impact and the endings are purely nonsensical
its very sad to see it end that wayedit update bioware has done an excellent job of supporting the multiplayer mode for this game which i applaud
they have massively increased the size and scope of this game mode and im still playing it almost daily all these months later
but they have really dropped the ball with the single player content in two ways
first there hasnt been nearly enough
leviathan and now today omega
my problem with them is the cost relative to the amount of content you get
its  dollars to get omega which amounts to about  hours of additional game play
way too steep
ill wait and see if they drop it down to  points which id be willing to pay
but  points for a few hours of play is just ridiculousthe journey was awesome it may not be what a lot of fans expected but considering the multiplayer aspect of this game is addicting and so much fun free multiplayer dlc community events as well as the single player campaigni cant recommend this game enoughplay it once for  hours play it again to make different choices play it again for yet more choices andor different classes and strategiesthe story and dialogue was moving there were plenty of difficult decisions even for a videogame to evoke on a player and while there were a few bugs here and there the journey was unforgettable
the ending might not be what most can comprehend or find satisfying for this trilogy but knowing bioware is providing dlc for free soon is a great gesturea  or  star rating clearly isnt a fair and unbias view deal of the day
thats a great price for a great game with lots of replayabilitywe fight or we diethere are a lot of neat things to watch for and a lot of cool quotesi will put these in my reviewone of these being a tv with a guy kind of like max headroomsome of you old timerslike myselfmay remember him from the sremember edi
wellnow shes the sexiest robot ive ever seen in my lifeshe still makes me very paranoidbut thats nothing new for me and womeni keep wondering if shes just here to study us and report back to the bad guys
kill anything in our wayone problem i had was the same button that makes you run also makes you rollso if your timing isnt just right you roll around instead of runit can be obnoxiousbutlittle annoyances are heavily outweighed by the cool stufflike dragon armorit even has the blood dragon from the front of dragon ageorigins on it
failure is not an optionthe krogans are as dumb as everdismissing ideas as irrelevant proves thatthey are pretty nasty tookrogan halatosis is supposed to be horribleand figuring in all of the planets and racesit must be legendaryhalatosis is chronic bad breath or death breathcommander shepherd picks up some cool moves like a skull stompits pretty brutali love itsome of the things werent so great thoughmy favorite characteri cant say whogets killed to get the stupid krogans to join the teamit was heart breakingi think the replay value is still extremely highi plan on replaying at least once since i can import decisions from part  and i could have a lot of fun with this seriesits just hard to know who to trust through all of the tough decisionsits tricky toosometimes you send someone to do a menial task and they get friedsometimes nothingyou just never know
i wonder where all the good in the universe isbecause its certainly not here
this nightmare never endssome of the characters show up as playercharacters or pcssome show up only in cut scenesso while you may have gone through great lengths  to keep certain characters alive from mass effect  and they may be only cameos in part one of the higher ups is called hacketi forget his rank but really highhe always says hack it outhe is a black guy who says he was born in londonhe has a sayingalways be in heaven at least a half an hour before the devil knows youre deadliara uses a line from star warsepisode revenge of the sithi wouldnt have mentioned itexept she said it during the really evil and exiting part just like the emporer
do what must be doneif you rememberthat was when anakin was sent out to murder anyone who opposed the emporerthis led into the end partthis game was nicknamed take back earthvery little of the game actualy takes place on earthand i expected a city to city crawlsniping aliens from big benusing the great wall of china for coverand using anti aircraft rifles to shootdown reapers from the pyramidsbut the final confrontation was only one city longthere are many enemies but one of the last guys i got to take out ranks right up there with officer tenpenny from gtasan andreas and lucian from fable  as one of the most satisfying kills of all timethis game is my prediction for game of the year it is currently my th  favorite video game of all timeand i am most likely going to play the entire series over and over to see what kind of neat and interesting changes i can makeso ive got my shaved head just like shepherdmy controller matches his armorhis action figure inspiring me and me n cap and shirt onand im going to take back earthagainbefore you scream at me for being a buthert winer
try it fanboys i dare you please hear me outi loved me i enjoyed me even though it was a mess storywise but this game killed it for medont think me a whiny toddler me had some great moments but heres the problem theyre all in the middle of the game im referring of course to the missions on rannoch and tuchanka
from there it rapidly devolves into a bizarre acid trip filled with whiny emo space ninjas well one whiny emo space ninja a mustachetwirlingly evil villain the illusive man that is
the mysterious antihero from me who is suddenly the emperor of the galactic empire from star wars in me a terrorist organization with barely a hundred and fifty members just a few months ago that suddenly has limitless troops and resources and a heartwarming story about a little boy who just wanted to preserve all advanced life in the galaxy by killing it offalright lets get our hands dirty with the ugly truth shall we
me is a bad game
the writing the difficulty and the pacing are all over the map the combat is little more than a gears of war ripoff and the romances are little more than cheap poorly written fanservice for hormonal little preteens and gay gamersbut here dear readers is the unforgivable grievance the fly in the ointment the phantom itch on my ass as it were none of your decisions matter in the slightest unless you consider a series of inconsequential cameos to be meaningful
decided to save the citadel council or not
good job you cute little lab rat have a meaningless cameo
wanted jacob in your squad
too bad hes off being a stereotypical n word courtesy of the new all inclusive ea enhanced bioware writing
d
wanted miranda in your squad
too bad shes off dicking around for no apparent reason
wanted grunt in your squad
too bad hes off playing heroare you starting to see a pattern here
everybody is off doing their own thing while the giant space cthulhus are busy destroying civilization as we know it
does that make sense to youand why is cerberus the main antagonist all of the sudden
i thought the giant flying squids with death lasers would naturally take precedence over the neofascist morons
did i miss somethingthe following is a series of minor grievanceswhere was the exploration
i know i know the incredible gravity defying refrigerator on wheels in me was a bit ridiculous but at least being able to explore planets gave the galaxy a sense of bigness
by contrast me is a painfully linear hallway shooter that scoffs at the idea of you the player going off on your own in any shape fashion or formspace combat anyone
for those of use who played freelancer and star control  space combat was a must for this last installment of the trilogy
so where was it
arent we fighting a race of giant sentient starships
why is the entire game focused on the ground where no difference can be madei give this game a 
not just because of how bad it is but also because of the nasty childish reactions from certain bioware moderators to its fans on the bsn forums
dont expect another cent from me after that you pathetic juvenilesi would also like to impart a cheerful middle finger to the fans who made us the retake movement all look bad by screaming like infants and even leaving bioware death threats
dont expect anyone to take you seriously kiddos
at least not until you all grow uplet this game rot on your nearest game stores shelves
it isnt worth your timethis was worth the fullpriced preorder
the graphics and gameplay are topnotch and a marked improvement over the previous two entries in the series
the story is welltold and the multiplayer is fun and slightly addictive
the ending wasnt as bad as i feared but it wasnt great by any means
other than the multiplayer theres hardly any replay value and im sure ill be able to find on youtube any story updates bioware releases to improve their lessthanstellar ending
definitely worth a purchase especially at subthis was my first time playing a mass effect game which i wouldnt even be able to say if my friend hadnt bought the game and let me watch him play it
it looked like it could be fun so i gave it a few runs while he wasnt playing
luckily for me he went home the past weekend allowing me to take his  into my dorm room and finally finish the gamefor those that dont like reading long reviews ill summarize it for you
the storyline made me want to play the previous titles
the gameplay didntmass effect  continues from the events of the last game
thats about all i can tell you storywise since i dont want to spoil the very little i know
however i can say the storyline is a verywell written one
there are many different twists and turns in the plot granted the ending is very disappointing if you dont believe in the indoctrination theorygoogle it and anytime a game makes me google bits and pieces of the story to gather more information you know the story was an amazing one
the style of the storytelling isnt as good as uncharted in my opinion but i still enjoyed it very muchwhat made the game less enjoyable and a times a bit of a drag to play was the many glitches and how it played
there were times where shepards powers simply didnt work no matter how many times i pressed the buttons i mapped them to
because of this i would for example try to do a biotic charge to replenish my shields only to end up dying because the game isnt responding to my inputs
another thing that bothers me is some of the animation of the characters
too many times will a character turn around but their head will decide nah im going to stay right here to the point where it looks like the motion of their body broke their own necks
it doesnt happen once in a blue moon either
there will be times where the voices simply wont work if you skip cutscenes too quickly
for example if i skip a couple of the cutscenes on the final mission the ambient noise drowns out the actual dialogue even though the subtitles are still telling me what is being saidthe gameplay feels like gears of war but made by amateurs
the movement feels a bit sluggish to me and is not as fluent as even the first gears
there are times where shepard will try to vault over an object but wont make it over a la battlefield  before the recent patch sometimes ill latch onto walls when im trying to pick up something while looking directly at it and its also not painless to get away from coveroverall if it werent for the story i wouldve given this game a   i think its very disappointing that we still have companies that cant avoid simple bugs in games and its   its almost as if developers are going to the publishers saying the game is playable but there still are a few bugs that we have yet to fix and the publisher responds perfect
start shipping the game eagerly waiting for their bank accounts to increase
its not a horrible case in mass effect  im talking to you resistance  but that doesnt mean im willing to let it slide
but because the gameplay isnt horrid and the story is simply amazing i cant help but give it four stars
if youre new to the series im sure youll enjoy it as much as i do even more if youre a fan of rpg gamesgames with rpgelements
im not a huge fan of them but i still really like this gamethis will be short and i will not go into great detail about the single player suffice to say that it is beyond wonderful and amazing
i too was one of the folk who could not import my sheps face from me however i do not allow a tiny annoyance to ruin my game experience in that i write a  star reviewi digress
the single player is amazingthe multiplayer is surprisingly funi did not think id end up getting this game release date but i went for it anyway
i do not regret it in the least and i recommend to all those sitting on the fence about whether or not to purchase the game  go for it
its worth the moneywhy do people bash an entire product because it didnt end the way they wanted it to
did they want a cliche and forgetable happy ending
i thought the ending was epic and sad
reminds me of when lost had a great yet sad ending that everybody bashed the entire season formass effect  is a great game improving on mass effect  and   the story flows smooth and using the galaxy map is improved for easy use
the multi player is fun and challenging though with only  game mode can get repetitivei have nothing against companies trying to protect their intellectual property with mechanisms like online pass but please make it work for the people who actually buy the game
for the second time in a row purchasing a new copy of an ea game my online pass code is invalid
the last time it was a new ps copy of bulletstorm that came with invalid code now its an xbox  version of mass effect  this makes me seriously think twice about buying any ea product especially one with any online multiplayer componentthis has to be one of the best games out there
i have played the mass effect series since the first game came outand i am absolutely glad that i did
the whole trilogy created a wonderful experience
you get to meet great characters find out more about a huge storyline and even create meaningful relationships within the game
moreover the game has many action rpg and shooter based concepts
i love it
i am not particularly a fan of turn based rpg though i have played many
mass effect really changed that
in the third installment you can even customize further
for example if you do not want to worry about being able to aim and shoot you can play the story mode which focuses more on you and the story and the choices that you must make
if you like more of a shooter choose the action mode
if you would like the whole rpg experience choose the mass effect rpg mode
they did an outstanding job at keeping it genuine for fans that have played the series while making it easy for new gamers to get into the actionthe galaxy exploration was greatly improved
you do not have to suffer with all the mako hard terrain experiences or the endless planet probing
moreover you are free to make paragon and renegade choices and still manage to improve your reputation
you are no longer tied to being an extreme paragon or extreme renegade
i have played both a full renegade and paragon in mass effect  and  and sometimes it felt like you were forced to either be too good or be too bad
in mass effect  you can mix it up
do what you feel like doingthe actionshooter elements are great while keeping true to rpg elements as well
there is a lot of customization and do not forget the awesome interactive narrative story
it feels awesome to be able to choose how you want to react and to see how people react to youa lot of people seem to be upset because of the endings
yes the endings may leave people with many questions left unanswered but you can still manage to get important characters to live and the game leaves the story left for lots of interpretation
while i do agree that it could have been better executed the endings should not undermine everything else that made the game greatyou will learn to love care enjoy the experience
you forge relationships that are important since the first game
they have done a great job at expanding those relationshipsfriendships and despite what people say your choices will still matter
will you betray a friend in order to gain military support for your dying people
will you kill an entire civilization to prevent your own extinction
theres a lot to think about and if you really have put time to discover the experience within all the games all choices will matter
mass effect  has done a great job at putting together a huge story that no other game has ever done
the fact that you can carry your original character and choices is by itself something that not all games can say they have done
spoilerdo not be swayed to give up on this game simply because the endings were not completely executed properly or because some people failed to make your hero and friends survive
shepard and the crew are able to live
heshe does not die in all the endingsin summer  there will be an extended cut to the ending
friends who went to pax east said that it seems that it will be more than just cutscenes
it is going to allow the gamer to expand further based on their choicessome people were angry with the final of this game but the game  is really good you will enjoy it from begining to endi loved the original mass effect and played through it six times sometimes at higher difficulty settings with the same character othertimes with entirely new characters
it was a game that provided an epic experience relatively deep role playing and cover based shooting that was fun and engagingmass effect  was a good game but with it bioware had thrown the baby out with the bathwater
it was a different game really more an action adventure than an rpg
it tried to focus more on characters and on an overarching storyline and less on individual quests
it felt muddled and incohesive to memass effect  falls somewhere in between the two previous games i guess with more rpg elements then mass effect  but with a feel that is still more action adventure than rpg
bioware has replaced rpg elements in both  and  with strategy elements
its not about completing quests for the their own sake as much as completing them to build up a meter or accumulate npcs so you can beat an end bosswhat the mass effect series loses in my opinion by changing the focus from rpg to a shooterstrategy hybrid is a focus on great level design
by replacing smaller environments that seemed larger then life in the original game with much bigger more generic environments the sequels lose the tactical elegance that comes with carefully crafted levelsbut beyond that mass effect  has a cast of characters that just isnt exciting
sure mordin is awesome and garrus is pretty good but krogans are like the tired old klingons of star trek
and while the story seemed original back when the first game came out it nows feels tired and overdone not to mention convoluted and kind of ridiculousmass effect  isnt a bad game but i dont think its a great one either
if you have to know what happens next i guess you dont want to miss out on it but i found myself unable to even finish it
i made it half way through and just decided it wasnt worth my time or the effortforget the naysayers that gave this game bad reviews based on the endingthis game and series is not all about the ending but the entire experience
in all my years of gaming and moviewatching never have i enjoyed a story or cast of characters more than i have with mass effectcommander shephard is in my opinion the greatest character in video games and maybe even movies
i enjoyed playing as shepard and through three games i really became connected to the character
the supporting cast is nearly as interesting with garrus in particular accopanying me on every missionnow mass effect  truly brought the series to a climax and i personally had no huge problems with the end
its true that some things really werent answered or explained in the end but that is being addressed in dlc which is out now actuallyin short if you want to experience excellent rdperson combat and absolutely incredible absorbing story a truly memorable cast of characters better than star wars in my opinion beautiful graphics the total package really then get all three mass effect games
if you dont have  hours to kill then get mass effect this game stayed in my xbox tray for  straight months
i only ever took it out when my  year old daughter wanted to play a kinect gamehands down my fondest memories in gaming will be found in my experiences in the mass effect universe and with commander shepards adventures
sure skyrim is right up there but that game lacks the memorable characters of this gameseriesdo yourself a favor if you love gaming and scifi get this gameseries
you wont regret it
when you finish itthem form your own opinion
but i can honestly say thisno gameno game has ever made me feel such a broad range of emotions while playing and advancing the story as much as this one
without question
that is what i want from my gaming experiencethank you bioware
you have done what no other company has done
you made me forget i was playing a game at timesthat is huge
i will never forget my experiences playing this and if i could give  stars i wouldbest game i have ever played
period
buy iti loved the mass effect series including me up until the final conclusion
the ending represented an epic failure rather than an epic conclusion
it was not worthy of the massive story that went into itgoodfinally got the right balance between rpg elements and combat
inventory management is not the same issue from me yet still fleshed out more from meseveral but not all characters seem to have grown into what should have been the epic conclusion to this story
those characters make up for the otherwise flat cameos and extrasmultiplayer is fun and not bogged down by pvp competition
the only way to win is to cooperatebadreadiness assets make no sense
how in the world does one find a friendly fleet just hanging out on the surface of a planetthe ending
pure and simple
i feel massively let down with what appears to be a rushed ending
so many characters that were developed so deeply and so many species engaged in the same struggle only to have a decidedly blah ending
i would have gladly waited another  months or year for a fully realized ending instead of this messif i had not already collected me  and  i would have rented rather than bought thisq are the days of me buying a game on day one overa yesapparently most games these days are just not ready when theyre releasedim basically very understanding of bugs and glitches
games are often extremely ambitious and massive in scale
there are bound to be conflicts and problems
i get it
for example i didnt complain about the bugs in skyrim
its a complex game and the programming bugs where of a complex nature  they did however get the basics right and they were solid from the startin the case of mass effect  the basic ability to import your character doesnt work
its not only the very first option offered in the game its literally one of the keys to the game
mass effect as true fans know is meant to be an immersive continuing story with characters and a universe that the player is meant to care about and become invested in  especially commander shepard
i mean whats more important then the players identity in the gamethe ability to import your shepard was promised and not delivered
sorry you get stars taken off for that
of course we all know they can do it since they did it in me
we also know that accomplishing this ability requires only the most rudimentary and basic programming skills
was it that they just didnt care
really look at everything else they are accomplishing in the game only to have blown a simple yet important detail like this
it needlessly drags the game  probably a brilliant five star game  into average status  at least for the time beingthey will probably fix this
i hope
im sure theres a first grader around that might have time to fix it after school or something
i mean its essentially just graphics that have been assigned a numerical value then transferring these numbers and graphics from their own software saves to their own software
the game and its true fans deserve betteri love this series
playing it through first to third is an amazing experiencethe first time through i liked the ending
yes its an abc choice but they make sense depending on how you play your commanderthe graphics are breathtaking and i love being able to romance the same people from prior games
combine that with the fps elements this is just a good conclusion to the trilogymy experience seems to be the opposite of so many other people here loving the game until the end part
for me that ending wouldve bumped this game from a  star to a  star for me
but the other problems with gameplay and dialogue are just too much to fully ignoreme i was horrified and appalled by the demo which had some awful dialogue and that stupid contrived kid thing with shepard
but looking back i think the dialogue has always been this kind of averagebelow average since the first game and i only started noticing now
i may have missed the fact due to my shouting my own dialogue at the screen which i think is better and i know is wittier
i do realize the ending is controversial but i never had any idea it would cause such a vicious backlash amongst reviewers
personally i loved it yet its also frustrating because its the end with no further explanation and yet i love it because its left like that without a whole lot of pointless explanationi dont think the ending alone is worth people giving it star and complaining so loudly and i dont know why theyd be complaining so viciously about itsince gameplay is my biggest problem ill start with itid like to start by thanking the ingame war criminal and enemy of all sentient life who thought it was a good idea to get rid of guns that had infinite ammo with a brief few seconds to vent heat with a new system of severely limited ammo with heat sink clips because they make clicky noises now
clicky noises
this had existed since mass effect  but its exacerbated in this game as bullets do far less damage against enemies that are souped up as thick as gears of war steroid guzzlers and some wearing armor so insanely thick and heavy they literally need engines in their suits just to manage the tremendous weight
an entire clip from an assault rifle cant even take down the most basic lowlevel foot soldiers anymore
ive literally found myself in situations where i ran out of ammo thank you aforementioned war criminal ill see you in court after the war and ended up dead or having to rush enemies and pop them in the head repeatedly or distract them with biotic powers while scouring for heat sinks around the barely visible mapand of new gameplay features the coverbased combat takes on a new importance with the insanely high armor and insanely low weapon damage as well as with new options allowing you to roll around
i have never encountered a situation where this roll has not been a detriment or served no purpose other than to botch my attempt at hitting cover and instead roll against the cover and stand back up out in the open
similar such rolls from cover to cover provide a great way to go nowhere in the middle of a firefight or get caught in a nearinfinite loop because youre too clumsy to handle the controls to get out of rolling around back and forth or just awkwardly stepping back
this stupid roll system has even caused me to stop sprinting through most levels because i will get caught in corners from an unintended roll and end up smacking against it into coverthen comes the end of the game we all lose earth and then the entire galaxy is destroyed and everyone loses because shepard is too stupid to jump or climb a weirdlooking pile of debrisokay so thats not really the end but that was the first time in the entire mass effect series even ahead of the first games sloppy ground rover that i had to reload a save because i got stuckmild spoileron london after clearing out the reaper forces as part of the mission to take out a hades cannon to secure landing ground for hammer i come across that crackedopen building with the empty bookcase in front of me and the fire on the right
after i found the chesthigh wall to get up on and it plays the cutscene of my shuttle being shot down i somehow fell off that height back to where i startedand i could not get back up
there was no chesthigh wall to crawl over and i could not jump or climb atop the small debris pile to get back up to that position
i spent a full  minutes wandering around trying to find a way around before reloading and realizing that the game removes the chesthigh wall after this cutscene meaning  you if you slip off  love biowareleading up to the ending nothing in the story impressed or inspired me
i could barely gather up enough interest or care to do most of the side missions most of which were incredibly short thankfully and involve a lot more loading than actual gameplay
other main storyline missions seemed to lead me around in circles with no real plan other than do this bend over backwards and do a flip for this shady criminal person so that they will pledge support for the final assault
and so early on they dug up a big magic macguffin in the form of a magical superweapon that we just discovered right now to completely wipe out all the reapers maybeanother new feature that i thought would serve some purpose is a support system in dialogue
at random areas two people will be arguing usually about some ethical or moral or legal issue and you have the option to support one or the other and end the argument
some of them seemed to be important and potentially have an effect on the endgame such as whether to triage wounded more harshly due to the potential of dwindling medical supplies but ultimately dontanother part of the story that frustrated me was the stupid dream sequences
i wont say anymore on them because they arent that frequent and theyre not a huge nuisanceanother issue i have involves bugs and glitches
compared to the previous two games this one is loaded with lots of odd glitches and bugs
very frequently the game has frozen during loading sequences compared to never with the last two and ive had triggers either fail to start such as on thessia when the asari told me to man the mounted gun then after i kill everything nothing happens and the asari captain keeps screaming for me to man the gun even though nothing is coming at us or be delayed long enough for me to think something has gone wrongand the music up until the ending i barely noticed it
i thought it was weak and insignificant a huge step down from the previous games the way modern warfare s music was barelythere compared to hans zimmers work in modern warfare but then theres the endingi wont spoil it but i spent an entire hour just playing through all possible endings shocked and awed and every other stockphrase for blown away and shaken
for those whove already played it i ultimately went with the middle choice the one with the beam and the green lightthe ending was something utterly colossal and phenomenal
it was ascensional if thats a real word and if not then i make it a new word
it was the sort of event that doesnt just change things forever like an independence day type ending but completely changes everything for everyone forever
it reminded me a lot like the endings of  a space odyssey and the book sequel
the next stage of sapient lifeand that epilogue was something
it makes me wonder about what happened with the normandy at the end the mass relays and who is buzz aldrins stargazer
and what stories does he have to tell about the shepardafter spending more than  hours i finally finished this game tonight
i enjoy every moment of this game from the beginning to the end
there is a feeling of hopelessness and desperation that pervade throughout the whole game
the characters emotions are conveyed so well in this game such that i actually can feel the brutality of losing loved ones and homes
it makes me root for sheppard and all his beloved companions and hope that despite all their hopelessness the best will eventually come to them
i spent  hours on this game because i kept reloading cut scenes that i felt emotional about and kept retrying different dialog options to see different outcomes
yes i love this game so much that i just dont mind reloading my saved games again and againi played with the extended cut dlc so i dont know what the ending was like before that dlc
with the extended cut dlc i found my ending very satisfactory i choose the synthesis ending
i just cant understanding how anyone could give this game one star because of the ending this game is very well made through and through
maybe those people have misunderstood the ending or wasnt able to follow the story line but even so giving this game a single star just because they dont understand or like the ending doesnt make sense to mefor the people who claim that the developer lied and that their previous choices dont matter in this game i can give lots and lots of examples to show that previous choices of me and me does matter
many old friends from previous games appear in this game and influence the story lines and your previous decisions affect whether some of your old friends live or die
moreover you can save an entire race from extinction if you do things properly on previous gamesi have never felt so emotionally invested in a video game before this is the first time for me
thanks for making such a great gamemultiplayer is not included when you buy this game used
i thought this game was nice but the ending wasnt that good in my opinion
overall a pretty good gamemass effect trilogyi played each of the previous games more than one time and i used my favorite shepherd characterone whose every choice the whole series has been paragonto play this game
i felt that past choices mattered enough to make me glad i had imported my character
i love that the relationships from both other games are built ongameplayit feels a lot like the second game but the interface has been made just a hair more friendly
controls are fantastic once youre used to them
the squad commands work well and i made use of my squads powers all the time
the guns are good and i adored a few of the more expensive weapons
i also thought the gun modifications worked very well in this gameending scenesthe ending was a hard choice because one cant easily weigh what is right or wrong especially if they are like me and attempting to follow paragon
due to one earlier choice that many will not make the same way i did i felt that there was no right choice
however i was happy with the conclusion i got what most people refer to as the best conclusion since i completed the game entirely even though it wasnt very warm and fuzzy however if you watch through the credits after you beat the game at the end is a small warm and fuzzy little sceneverdictbuy it
it rocks my socks offno sense in rehashing what has been said already about the ending and how it ruined everythingmy only other critiques of the game have to do withthe poor coding of the game there were many glitches and having to change between the two cds  times over the course of the game is just infuriating and the camera angles in general were detrimentalrelative uselessness of the rpg aspect of the game if you are like me and have a very specific style of gameplay most of the mods weapon varieties power development and armor types had no perceptible impact on the gameplay but were just eye candyshattered atmosphere of all organic life will be ended having no time penalties for wandering around the universe launching probes to planets the ending and how you go about getting supplies as you would think when the universe really starts going down the drain the most elite team in the galaxy would be handed the best hardwareoverall dont let this game give you a shoulder massage of deathwhat do you consider the greatest game youve ever played
when this timeless question is asked welldeserving titles like the original super mario bros halflife and the legend of zelda are often mentioned
it then of course sparks a perpetual debate about what sort of prerequisites must be met to be considered among gamings most elite
however sometimes an anomaly approaches with substance and quality that are simply unmatched in virtually every category of contemporary gaming
sometimes a game just needs to be experienced to be fully understood and appreciated
thats the kind of game bioware has delivered with mass effect a few years ago when mass effect  hit store shelves i was so impressed with it that i didnt think itd be possible to outshine its incredible refined mechanics  i was wrong
from start to finish me is an absolutely captivating tale about love loss hope and hate
the decisions youve made the people youve met everything youve accomplished in the previous games comes fullcircle and theres no turning back now
i know it sounds like im blowing me up here and thats because i amas youve come to expect the strongest point in the series is located within the narrative
having been fully invested since the very first game i can say that biowares uncanny skill at weaving an intricate story cannot be commended enough
ostensibly me is about an alien force who wants to eradicate the galaxy because they can but its far more than something so seemingly bland
mes situations dialogue and personality behind every character is what makes every drop of interaction so meaningful as these scenarios expand the story itself
what do the reapers want
why do they perform this cycle every  years
the conclusion is shocking but do yourself a favour if you havent played any previous mass effect games  dont start hereone of the key points bioware has made about me is the major decisions youve made in the past
the good news is that these choices are a huge factor and definitely influence the way your game will play
for instance if youre unfortunate enough to have certain characters die off from the first game youll miss some monumental cutscenes and classic dialogue that relates directly to the central plot
more impressive though is how minor characters and unimportant people you interact with influence your surroundings
on more than one occasion i found myself speaking to someone i helped during a routine mission in the previous games
even your teammates name drop characters giving the game a much more dynamic feelspeaking of being dynamic me sports the best cutscenes ive ever witnessed
characters move around the rooms theyre in commit to different facial animations look around and touch objects its practically like watching a movie
the game also brings back the excellent dialogue interruptions and as usual theyre always fun to perform
although the thing im most appreciative of definitely has to be the humour buried within such a dire narrative
its largely in part to garrus and edi but theres some other characters who said andor did various things that had me laughing throughout the games duration
me is the new goldstandard for creative and intelligent cutscenesthe jump from mass effect to mes combat system was huge and in a lot of ways the jump is also quite large into me
the same systems are largely intact but the combat in general has been tuned to the point of perfection
headshots are now possible cover is no longer a chore to navigate and a brand new physics engine has been instituted making it incredibly satisfying when ending your adversaries lives
the guns are also fun to use and feel great letting a variety of superb sounds escape when fanning the trigger
playing as an adept i didnt use too many weapons as my biotics were my primary tool of chaos but even they created some wondrous satisfying explosions
melee combat has also been tweaked and depending on your class youll be able to deploy an omniblade or just straight up channel your biotic energy into some kind of superpunch
its pretty awesomein direct relation to the gunplay bioware has heard the call for more customisation ala the original me
unlike me which literally had just a handful of weapons me employs a long list of well over  unique guns
while i thought theyd all be similar in a way i took the time to fire each one and they most certainly are all one of a kind
the cool thing about this besides the variety is that now any class can use any weapon without restriction
want to be a shotgunwielding adept with a backup sniper rifle
go for it
then again the new weight system might have you hold back some of your crazy ideasthe weight system is pretty simple but adds some extra depth to certain classes
to put it simply the more guns you bring to battle the higher your cooldowns for your abilities will be
as an adept id switch my weapons around just for an occasional change but i usually rocked a heavy pistol of some sort
by only carrying this along with my upgrades my power cooldowns reached the bonus cap of  making it possible to spam my moves in many situations
however if youre more of a gun person you can modify every single weapon in the game with a multitude of different devices
making your gun lighter more accurate having it deal more damage the ability to see through smoke punch through cover theres a ton of options to choose from and whatever you decide to augment is also reflected in the model itself
thats right say this scope you found makes your gun more accurate simply attach it at a work bench and your gun will now have a physical scope on iti always found the talent systems for the first two mass effect games a little offputting
i didnt like how you had to pump so many points into things you didnt actively use or in mes case how you couldnt reach the maximum level in most of your skills
me fixes all of these issues giving you six different tiers of each ability with multiple choices of how you want to build them along the way
theres also bonus powers you can attain by conversing with your squad mates and if you felt like you screwed up somewhere there is a reset switch for all your talents
i swear its like theyve thought of everythinggreat as everything is some may find the more condensed character roster a bit disappointing
even if all of your squad members survived the suicide mission in me you really never get to use them as you did in the past
at first it might seem like a crime to omit such interesting and compelling characters but once you begin meeting back up with your old friends youll come to appreciate the way bioware has reinstituted them
since the galaxy is dealing with the reapers on every homefront it only makes sense that all your friends cant be chilling with you aboard the normandy
yes yes its too bad you cant get wrex back into your squad but believe me when i tell you that his constant appearances cinematics and dialogue more than make up for itit may also come as a sort of shock but me doesnt contain any minigames whatsoever
theres no more locks that need picking servers that need hacking or planets that require hours of probing
actually the scanner and probe system do make a return but its been entirely overhauled
instead of scanning random planets for their resources ala me me gives the normandy a new pulse auraupon entering a new system you can tap a button and the normandy will unleash a radial pulse that reveals important areas in that section
if a planet is highlighted you can then perform a scan on it but theres only ever a single item per planet and theres a compass that tells you exactly what direction its in
if you use this pulse while in a reaper controlled sector though they can invade the system and come after you while youre looking for items
all this means is that theres a demonic robot noise the things come in after you and if you want to survive then you need to just exit the map
i get biowares trying to represent the invasion but its far too easy to evade the reapers and even if they do catch you the game just reloads upon your entrance to the system
you lose maybe  seconds of your time
harsh i knowthe big new feature for the campaign is the focus on war assets or what youre bringing into the final confrontation
as you progress through the game youll convince those around you to commit to fighting the reaper threat
as you discover various objects complete missions and recruit people to join the fight your asset number increases
these assets also increase a bar that displays your effective military strength to combat the reapers
its not hard to fill the bar up but if youre one of those people who dont like to burden yourself with completing every little thing in the game you can jump into the multiplayer to help increase your assetsmultiplayer
in my singleplayer game
believe it
actually its not at all that bad
galaxy at war is a fourplayer cooperative experience that pits you against waves of enemies where have i seen this before
its emphasis relies heavily on good teamwork and the combat in me is good enough to make the mode worth checking out
sure it has its fair share of problems with imperfect hosting and feeling extremely grindy after a while but its sole purpose is to serve as a minor distraction
at least playing the multiplayer nets you campaign bonuses to make it feel more worthwhile
completion of maps grants a percentage increase in your efficiency rating which effectively means your bar for the final confrontation will gain a multiplier
again its not necessary to play the multiplayer to get the best endings to the game but its nice to have something as a decent distraction from the main storymass effect  is a masterclass in storytelling that comes second to none
its refined combat deeper customisation and personable characters make the experience worth it from start to finish and that goes double for the people whove been with the series from day one
while it may be the final entry in the trilogy you can bet that this isnt the last weve seen of mass effect  so grab your gear sit back and enjoy one of the best games of this generationthis review was written for gamersguidetolifecomenjoyed the article
follow me on twitterinfestedandygreat game and series that all gamers should check out
the action mode and story mode ways to play should appeal to allan rpg trilogy based on choices imposes an ending where none of your choices made over  games make any difference
insulting and amateurishand makes any replays difficult since you know you have to endure the stupidity of the ending yet againthis game ends the story of shephard
i love the story line it was a little disappointing at the end but all in all a great game
i will play this game over and overthis game is one of my favorites and a great way to end the mass effect trilogy
amazing story amazing ending and amazing gameplay
this game i recommend for anyone that loves rpg style games and doesnt mind third person shooters
there is a ton of customization and many different outcomes
such a fantastic gamethe best part of the mass effect series is the story and the characters but here the story is confusing and the new characters are lame
shepherds goal is to defeat the reapers by recruiting scientists to assemble an unfinished weapon
but he also gets the alien races to send their space fleets to earth
the other races are bogged down on their own planets fighting the reapers the turian homeworld is just as devastated as earth
why would the other races sacrifice themselves to save human beings
it doesnt make senseeventually you meet the reapers creator and he explains their origins
this was the most disappointing part of the story because what he says is nonsense
if the reapers were designed to bring order to the universe then why not exterminate all organic life
why allow organic life to keep reemerging
that way youd have permanent order
and if organics and synthetics are destined to war then why do the reapers need to intervene
wouldnt the organicsynthetic conflict resolve itself without the reapers
the reapers are just another part of the organicsynthetic conflict being hybrids and should therefore commit suicidewhat made mass effect  great was the memorable cast of characters it introduced the illusive man thane legion grunt miranda jacob and mordin
mass effect s new characters are lame by comparison
theres ign bubblehead jessica chobot as a reporter james vega a japanese samurai villain and an obnoxious british lesbian who tells you when youve got email
its hard to believe that the same people who came up with great characters like legion and the illusive man couldnt do better than this
the characters that i liked from the previous game legion thane grunt are unplayable and some of them die
you only get six squad mates this time around but the only one i liked was garrus
ashley williams is back but who caresgamers complaining about the ending have short memories  shepherd died twice in me so im sure bioware can resurrect him again
the problem is not shepherds fate which is openended
it is the plot holes lame squad mate selection forgettable new characters and the confusing storyyup thats right
i bought this for the multiplayer
its the second time as i bought it when it was released to see the end of the trilogy but after my xbox was stolen earlier in the year and i had no way to retrieve my prior saves
the disappointment of finishing the story with a different shepherd game me a bad taste in my mouth for any single player dlc or anything but i have been shocked at how long my friends have kept playing this game on multiplayer after so long on xbl
so i got it again on the cheap to play with them
i have to admit it has long legs for a horde mode style mp game
if you and your friends like leveling up getting unlockable goodies and respond to gambling thats right the whole you dont know what you get until you unlock it gag feels like pokemon or something and is addictive to people who go for such thingsim rating me with one star not for the fact that its a terrible game no in fact its a great game if anything its inferior to its predecessor
but the main reason im rating it  star its because the conclusion of the story is a raw insult to the thousands of fans who eagerly awaited this moment for a long time
after having invested a lot of money on the games and dlcs as well as hundreds of hours of game play just trying to twitch every part of the games to get the most out the story after all that im extremely disappointed and angry at ea and bioware apparently they decided to give us loyal fans one of the worst possible endings you could give to an amazing story like thisi will keep the  star rating until they give me complete closure to the full story and an ending worthy of the series
having read biowares blogs and other info websites i came to the conclusion that this current ending was probably all part of a marketing experiment from bioware just to get people talking according to them they did not want the game to be forgettable and so far they have succeeded
i read many articles about this but one of them specifically caught my attention when an angry disappointed fan asked them  is that it thats all the story for commander shepard
they answered  hardest
day
ever
seriously if you people knew all the stuff we are planningyoud well  hold onto your copy of me forever
we caaant say more this all meaning that they were planning all of it from day one and they are planning to give the complete ending through dlc like many of you im extremely disgusted with the ending of the game and i think its not worthy of the series but i for one will give them a chance to redeem themselves i want to see what they hold for us in the upcoming dlcs in april if they fail to deliver once again then this rating will simple stay as it iswhy would i give them a chance at all
well many people dont know what it takes to make a game like this it takes endless hours of work and requires a lot of sacrifices and if they actually do what im hoping they will do well id say that is worth giving them a chance
theres a theory circulating around the web  that the almost identical current endings are not the real ones and that supposedly all the events from the last minutes are happening in shepards mind allegedly he is fighting indoctrination from the reapers represented by his last actions in the endings and that the supposed full ending its coming in the dlcs
now i really have no idea if this if this assumptions are accurate though they seem quite reasonable given the current facts and having seen what eas greediness is capable of by charging extra for dlcthe pieces seem to fit together and as much as id like to say that i will not be paying for extra for dlc i think id be lying because all i ever want is closure to the storyi know that some people would call me a whiner and spoiled because i demand a better ending and closure to the series but after  long years of waiting and hundreds of hours of gameplay i just find it hard to accept when bioware wants to give us a pile of steaming crap as reward
i dont really know what people who are satisfied with the current ending must be thinking perhaps theyre not as passionate as i am towards the series  but i personally hate the ending in this game and i think that such extraordinary story deserves a better one
i really doubt that someone who has played the  games and has paid full price for them will be content with the current ending if they are then they belong to the  
ive also seen a few internet reviewers that think we are making a big deal out of this well of course they dont actually have to pay from their pocket to play the games we do they do not have that same sense of loss that the rest of us have and seriously i dont care if someone gets bothered by me complaining or by my rating put as much negative feedback as you want in my review  i will not change the rating i will keep it for as long as it takes until bioware and ea give me what i paid for i know that giving one star rating to a game in protest may not seem like much but the internet and people united seem to be doing wonders now in daysso you can either buy it right now if you are optimistic or wait til they release the dlc with the complete ending or until the price dropsfirst of all i got the game timely and it was in good condition
as for the game itself i held off completing the ending until bioware added the ending dlc
im satisfied with the difference to the ending and how they seemed to listen to most of the complaints from gamers
up until the ending me was amazing
i loved everything about it until i watched the original endings
i havent been a fan for as long as most only came in around me but from that i was still accustomed to complex storytelling and having my actions have consequences
the original ending seemed like a copout
the dlc still wasnt what i wanted or expected but it had enough variety from the original that i dont have anything to gripe about
i can respect bioware for fixing the mistakes but that dlc should have been a part of the game from the beginningme is not rpg
it is a super linear boring corridor shooteri have not seen much improvement since methis game refined the already wonderful game play of mass effect  its a blast all the way through
the story is great though id recommend stating with me  or  because its great for the things it does with the characters that have been building over timeit is small step below the endlessly memorable mass effect  but a solid game in its own right
the characters that have grown with you through the trilogy continue to develop and have the pay offs theyve been building to
the very end of the game has issues but its not the only end
throughout the entire game characters and areas meet conclusions and its completely satisfyingthe multiplayer mode is more of an afterthought but its surprisingly enjoyable
not a reason alone to buy the game but a fun mode to check outthis game flat out is one of the best games ever
one of the best series ever
the story the depth and the time you put into and the satisfaction is second to none
for all the bad reviews you read please ignore them or youll be missing out on one of the best games of all time
the ending was the ending people get over it
this is the sapranos ending all over again
people whine and complain about the ending but spent  years playing the series and loving every second of it so how about you appreciate the time youve spent and stop whiningbuy this game now
and if you havent played the other  do yourself a favor and buy those as well you wont be disappointeddonefirst of all the ending is just terrible
you pretty much get an ab or c endingwhich is what bioware promised not to delivernot only that but your choices dont matter
the multiplayer is filled with bugs and glitches ive lost all my unlocks and even lost some points that i bought a pack with to get going
bioware said they were on the issue  days ago
still nothing not even a we are working on it
biowareea are two terrible greedy companies that do not deserve the loyal customer fan base they have
very disappointedlet me start by stating that i have been an me nut since the first game
in fact mass effect is the only game rpg or otherwise that i have played  times in a row
once i finished one playthrough i would play another
the same can be said for mass effect me  starts off a little jarring
the story does not pick up immediately after me  instead some time has passed youre back with the alliance instead of cerberus and your mates have been scattered to the fringes of the galaxy
so of course you must assemble your team again
im guessing that the lapse in time for the story is probably explained in the me novels or comics but i havent read any of them
onced i got past this jarring plot start things started to pick up
the story goes whered you expect
true the ending isnt the best in the history of games or movies but its not the worst
and it is an ending
i like the fact that the series ends here
some franchises have a tendency to outlive their attraction by releasing game after game think of final fantasy or god of war
i respect and admire the fact that this is the end
also even though the ending could have been better im not going to let a lackluster ending kill my enjoyment of everything leading up to it
i do think that bioware could have differed the endings a little more than they did
there are  possible endings and each one is basically the same with only a few minor differencesthe graphics are the same as the previous two titles
graphics whores will not like this fact but i admire it as it gives amazing continuity to the series
the game is a little glitchy but i think this may be due to an update i need to install and havent been able to since i havent had network access during my playthroughthe design is consistent with the previous two titles
all alien species look like they should and act like they should
however it seemed to me that all female characters that came back from previous titles ahsley liara and jack were designed in an overly sexualized style
their boobs seemed to have gotten larger and jack always has hard nipples
the only ones to miss this change were miranda and shepherd
did someone at ea think this would add seriousness to the game
if anything it actually makes the game lose a little seriousness
also if you import a character from me  the stats will import but you will have to recreate your shepherd
me  did not have this flawsound and gameplay are great
the weapons in the game are interesting but i would have liked to have seen the heavy weapons back
in me  they are there but only as pickups that you get in the field and once youre out of ammo thats it back to normal weapons
also a minor let down for me is in the squad selection
the character present are great but in the first two games my favorite squad members were the krogans
me  has no krogan squad members
although it fits into the story to not have one my geeky admiration for the krogan would have liked to have had one in my squad
although i must admit that the further exploration of tuchanka was perhaps my favorite part of the gameall in all this is a good game that grants finality to the series
playing through with all main and sidequests complete put me right at  hours of total play
if missions were managed a little better on my part this might have been shaved by  or  hours
dont let all the negative reviews of this games ending prevent you from playing through the game
play through it yourself and see for yourself what you think of the ending
i feel that too many fanboys out there in review land wanted a better ending that would leave the franchise open for more games still possible for prequel stories
i for one think sequelitis is running rampant in games and movies
its time for things to have finality
mass effect  grants us finalitysingleplayer very similar to mass effect  which was excellent
the mass effect series is a unique blend of story action and light rpg elements
some fans are very disappointed with the final  minutes of a  hour game and the trilogy itself so beware of that
i thought the ending was good here come the downvotes but it did leave much to the imagination
a free dlc to expand upon the ending but not change it is coming this summermultiplayer surprisingly fun if you like coop action
bioware has a good design sense usually and it shows heresummary an excellent game which i will definitely play againbioware has outdone themselves yet again and have developed a climactic and satisfying finale to one of the best video game series ever created
even on its own mass effect  stands as a legendary aaa title
lets examine several categories gameplay story sound and the endinggameplaythe game feels the same as previous titles when walking around with shepard yet it feel smoother
bioware has managed to make the game feel like me without making gamers feel like theres been no improvement yet the improvements blend in so well that the mechanics dont feel foreign either
combat has been drastically improved imo
it feels less busy than it did in me and more tactical but the added customization options give combat a fresh edge to keep players coming backstorymass effect s plot is extremely strong
the writing is the best in the series and the repeated theme of sacrifice serves to make the overall story emotionally gripping
many of the cutscenes on different missions are so epic some of the character interactions are so powerful
there are more than a handful of unforgettable sequences here and with such a diversity of characters and dialogue its almost guaranteed that any gamer who picks up this game will see something they find memorable during their me experiencesoundi got my hands on the final fantasy series years ago as a kid so video game music has always been an important factor in helping a game be above the competition
with that said clint mansell has composed beautiful songs that fit the me universe with haunting perfection
some tunes will make you reflect some will make you be ready to grab your assault rifle and join shepard on the front lines and others still will make you tear up deep inside
ive got the soundtrack on my ipod
i listen to it quite often during the weekendinglet me first say i loved the ending and especially so now with the free extended cut dlc
without giving anything away though hopefully you havent been spoiled by other reviews i feel the ending forces gamers to really sit down and think about the implications of their ending
this makes it both more unforgettable and more mature than most endings in any art medium such as movies books etc
i think the reason so many gamers complain about the ending is because theyd rather have an ending spoonfed to them than have themselves think through things
thats just my opinion
i also felt all my choices along the way mattered
i remember the choices i made since me and they were given proper treatment in my book
all the important subplots came to fitting conclusions throughout me without feeling rushed
does this mean every single question i have about the ending was answered
no but i have to admit the extended cut really answered most of the things i pondered about
ultimately the ending was not cliche in the least which is something i and many other gamers really valueheres the bottom line youre shooting yourself in the foot by not buying this game
its one youll want on your shelf for years to come
its the finale to a level of storytelling that is unprecedented in any entertainment industry
even if you are left unsatisfied with the ending the journey all the way there is one heck of a ride youll always rememberwhat eabioware calls artistic integrity its clear there are many thousands of mass effect fans who feel incredibly cheated by mes horrifically depressing endingi would have given this game a solid five stars
great graphics
good combat mechanics
excellent return to modable weapons
eliminating most of the tedious planet scanning
enabling you to pick any class and weapon you liked i went with a sniper riflewielding adept  it was an awesome combination
fascinating storyuntil the last  minutes
then if it was possible to give negative stars here on amazon id hit this one with a starting in on me with an imported character id played all the way through the first two titles in the series and all the dlcs i could see all kinds of decisions affecting the storys progression and events
it was incredible and satisfying because whether you were a paragon or renegade mattered whether youd saved certain characters or not choices affected the availability of other choices and it all kept buildingthen came a game finish that sucked so bad i wondered if it had been written by the eight year old they had doing the voice work that spacekid
ill do my best to stay spoiler free here
for the last odd minutes of me it doesnt matter what companion crew members you picked for the final mission
doesnt matter whether your crew loves or fears you
doesnt matter whether you played as good or bad or neutral ruthless or compassionate
doesnt matter if you had a romancebecause trust me on this if you did you will regret having gotten attached to anyone
doesnt matter if you had the best equipment in the game or anything at allheck it doesnt even matter by then what class youd playedyou lose everything you ever cared about and by all indications its forever even if you did manage to keep shepard from dying in the end
all the freedom you had before to do what you want all the choices collapse into a singularity of predestined outcomes illogic and utter solipsism
nietzsche himself couldnt have written a more depressing story conclusiondont even get me started on the massive plotholes that result simply from the ending itself
others have covered these in excruciating detail
things get bad youre in terrible shape and apparently your entire crew abandons you to run away
lovelythere are at most three possible endings with one little side addition to one of them
the only thing that determines the availability of the endings and your ability to choose among them is whether you did enough side missions andor if you played enough of the multiplayer version to jack the percentage on the effectiveness
iphoneipad owners have an additional option to increase it by playing a mass effect mobile game exclusive to ios platforms
androidkindle owners
out of luck
side hint there are folks and sites online that can provide info on how to hack the games config files to raise your galactic readiness score because despite eabws assurances if you do not have the ios game and do not play the mp version you can not get what theyre calling the best possible ending on a first playthough not even if you use an imported me character
period
again towards the end of mass effect  if you had not upgraded your ship and had not secured the loyalty of your crew members by doing their personal sidemissions they would die
the suicide mission could become exactly thator if you worked hard you could save everybody
what youd done affected the endingmass effect 
be nice to your crew ignore them call them idiots  it doesnt matter
youre on your own in a situation that might only be a huge reaperinduced indoctrination hallucination youve no way of knowing and the game certainly doesnt offer any real solace or answers
all weve gotten from eabw is their insistence that the trilogy ended exactly as they intendedanyway i was grateful to have had some forewarning that the ending would likely be unsatisfying because at least that way when i got there i didnt have the urge to hurl a paperweight through a nearby window or drink myself unconsciousseriously its a fun game
incredibly fun
but as far as replaying might go i cant see myself ever going beyond point where the next thing to do is to confront the illusive man
because thats when everything starts to go to hell and theres no turning back
on update july   i have downloaded and played the extended edition ending
its better
i no longer feel like i completely wasted my time because the new version does show evidence of the actions and decisions you made during the game
looks like the it was all an indoctrination hallucination theory is dead and buried
now we know why joker and the normandy left
and hey krogan babiesgame really brings together the trilogy
despite what i heard about the ending i thought it was awesome
without any spoilers ill only say it was refreshing to have an end to a game that didnt just make everything dandy in the universei can understand that a lot of people were disappointed with the ending but i think its overly harsh to rate the game with one star especially when most of these same reviewers say that they enjoyed the game up until the last mission
were talking  hours worth of enjoying a game and not liking the last hour or less
maybe knock off a star or two for the ending would be more fair
i would have rated this game a  because i dont like the fact that to get the best ending youll need to play multiplayer and the end did fall flat with some questionable things that happened
but up until all of that the game was fabulous
spoilers below because i want to discuss all the great things about this gamei loved how they incorporated just about every character i had met or had missions with in prior games and allowed me to have some sort of closure with each and every one of them
i especially loved helping the quarians and geth resolve their centuries long war and was able to help wrex and his people as well
lost a couple of good friends in this last game as well but their deaths were good ones and both went out heroes which is okay with meloved touring the ship after each mission and catching crew members chatting in the galley area or talking over the intercoms and discussing missions or telling jokes
loved two of the crew members both having moments of weakness and getting drunk and how funny those scenes were
also really enjoyed seeing the world through edis eyes as she tried to understand humanity and also the relationship between edi and joker
i especially loved and laughed at jokers reaction to seeing edi in her new bodyso maybe theyll give us a new ending like fallout  did but even if they dont i still tremendously enjoyed this gamethis is one of my favorite game series in a very long time
such an epic story
multiplayer keeps the game fun even after you have beat the single player portion a few times
i highly recommend all mass effect games to everyoneive been playing the mass effect series since the beginning the first of which is still the best despite the lackluster combat
bioware has this problem where they just cant leave something good alone
sure they fix a lot of the annoying problems but they also add a lot more when they do
me is a perfect example of how bioware takes something good and screws it up
me has a lot going for it but it still suffers from biowares meddlingthe journal is the worst of the series completely useless
side missions very few most are just scanning systems and planets for items or people you dont even get to land and help out rescuing these people you just magically pick them up and never hear from them again
its a major disappointment
whatever happened to the flawed but fun mako and climbing random planets mountain rangesthere is less choices in conversations you dont really get to control what shepard says most of the timecharacters movements are still awkward and in my opinion unnatural but in me shepard and others will actually twist their heads to look over their backs
creepy
characters arms will move through their body when they move and some random people on the citadel will walk through shepard when he is standing in their way
they did not take time to polish this game its pretty sloppy in that regardthat said there are a lot of pros to the game its still pretty fun and has the best combat of all three games
theres more than  crappy assault rifles this time around but me already had more weapons and upgrades
the feel of the story is pretty cool it does feel dramatic and somewhat desperatemultiplayer like many i was very put off by bioware adding multiplayer to one of my favorite titles
since then ive played it its actually really fun and i have spent in some cases more time online playing than actually playing the campaign
so bravo bioware for getting something rightoverall bioware gets worse and worse at making games they should take notes from bethesda and todd howardi like this game a lot although i feel the developers tried to do too much in this one and got away from some of the things that made the previous game so much fun
still highly recommend but those looking for an improvement will be disappointedea should be ashamed
day  dlc is a slap in the face to people who support you
i will no longer be a victim of this corporate greed
it is ruining the gaming community
we need to take a stand before its too latei am a gamer that reluctantly came to the mass effect universe on the day of the superbowl between the patriots in and the giants in 
try it my brother said as he handed it to me
i wasnt so sure  space adventures werent my thing but the wife and kids were gone that day so i decided to give it a try   hours later i realized that i had missed the entire superbowl having my dinner and was now irrevokably hooked on this game
 review contains some spoilers five years later i had played both of the first two games multiple times created three different shepards based on class history and gender purchased all dlc for each and even purchased the dlc for the prothean squad member on me  a huge investment for any gamer but i wanted the full monty experienceflash forward the the preorder i did on me   i started playing it the moment i got it thanks amazon delivery
and was blown away at the games story  how dark and depressing it was
how hopeless your situation is as you are watching the reapers wipe out everything in site
your squad members develop deep emotional ties to the story and your character as they each go through certain areas of depression as their own loss begins to mount
that was truly amazing in and of itselfbut one thing that truly bothered me before i even got to the ending is that i didnt see where a lot of my decisions in the previous games really had an impact on the overall story except for the fact that i had saved every squad member from me and their appearances in me gave me some more missions to help in my final battle on a planet i was currently engaged ini did meet up with the rachni queen that i had spared with my paragon shepard but the same situation also arose with my renegade shepard who destroyed the rachni queen in me and found a hybrid queen developed by the reapers in the cavewierdbut through it all i found the game intriguing satisfying and intense all the way up to the final battlethen everything went sideways and that was not a good thingi had read some of the online reviews on amazon before i had even gotten halfway through the game
when i saw the   star rating i was shocked
when i read that it was because of the ending i said to myself this is biowareit cant be that bad can it
when i finally got to the end credits i said ummyesit was that bad
i felt such a let down that i was hesitant to play the game again but i wanted to see how the game responded to a renegade shepard and i wanted the achievementsthat being said when i saw the reaction from bioware who defended the ending i was dumbfounded
it had to be one of the worst i have seen in any game to date which instead of answering all plot points and bringing the story to a conclusioni felt it left more questions than answers as pointed below what happened to the combined organic fleet engaging the reapers
was it destroyed or was it stranded in the sol system now that the mass relays were destroyed why was joker fleeing from the battle
how did he get my squad members i had taken to earth on the normandy
why didnt he just land on earth what happened to all the characters
what were their fates
who died
who lived what was shepards ultimate fate
i ended up getting the ending where shepard takes a breath but that was itwhat the heck
in conclusion i was extremely dissatisfied that i had spent so much money on dlc and hoping that all of it would have an impact on me and its ending
some of it did in fact affect my gameplay but i was still left with too many questions from this epic franchise
the fact that bioware has dug their heels in and refused to redo the ending has also left me disheartened at trying any further bioware games
that to me is just wrong
you as a company should be developing games that satisfy gamers not your publisher
i truly smell eas fingers in this messfortunetaly bioware is creating some free dlc this summer to further explain the ending of me but still  explain
if you have to go back to explain your games ending then maybe it wasnt such a good ending after allhowever one may view this game it did give me some truly tough and emotional choices
my most compelling one is listed belowmy renegade female shepard had chosen to destroy the genophage cure in me
as a result wrex who survived me was more hostile to her than my paragon shepard who saved the cureafter meeting up with mordin and assaulting the shroud i decided to sabotage the cure to get the salarians on my side
mordin was irate when i tried to talk him out of it
eve had already died and he had become completely emotional  much like maelon did in me
he walked toward the elevator and a renegade interrupt came up
i pulled the trigger and shot him right in the back
i was really disturbed by the two minutes of cut scene which showed him crawling along the floor whispering not yetnot yet as he tried to put the cure into the machine
he died before he could and the shroud explodedi thought that was the end of that but later wrex confronted my shepard on the citadel on destroying the cure and killing mordin
he then tried to shoot her with a shotgun until i found a gun and shot him dead
that was also another huge holy crap
momentlater on the normandy she talked with garrus
he asked why wrex had tried to hill her
i had her admit what she had done and garrus was somewhat sympathetic at the difficult choice she had to make
but he added was mordin okay with this
my shepard remained silent
garrus turned to his screne and said this damn war  intensein conclusion i will be downloading the dlc this summer as i wish to have my questions answered but i fear i may be left with more questions than i had originally started with
please fix this bioware
i true fan pleads to youupdate  i downloaded the free update concerning the games ending along with the leviathan dlc
i was most pleased that the glaring plot holes at the end were resolved much more satisfactory than the launch ending
one has to wonder why they rushed out an incomplete game in march when they could have done this from the beginningi wont complain much considering that bioware took the angst the fans had and actually tried to make things right
thank you bioware  just be aware of this in the futurefor those that havent finished mass effect  the first part of my review will be spoiler free but the second part must be rife with spoilers because the story and ending is the biggest problem of the game
ill also preface this review by saying that the me series had been probably my favorite gaming series of all times and i beat the campaign of me three times while i finished the campaign of me four times
i had been incredibly excited about the game and had been able to avoid practically every spoiler except for two smaller ones about edi and the prothean character
even though the game is flawed i loved pretty much  of the game but the ending was so bad that it has ruined my entire mass effect experience
i was going to play the game again with my female character as i loved the voice over work of jennifer hale but now i dont really want to
i was even going to start a new character in me and play all three games in succession but now it just isnt worth itso lets start with the gameplay which in the mass effect series is split between the rpg aspects and the third person cover shooting battle system
me definitely has the best action gameplay of the entire series and while it can still be clunky there are constantly amazing moments with dozens of different but equally awesome strategies you could employ
i just wish there were almost more buttons on the controller for this game
its one of the most effective uses of a controller in any shooter where you really have so many different attacks you could use at every moment
most of the clunkiness once again resolves around the action button being the same as the sprint and cover button
im not sure if it would work but it could be interesting if the action button was instead mapped to the select button the only one that isnt used in the gamenow on to the rpg systems of the game which is much improved from basic systems in me for mass effect  they basically took most of what was in me and stripped out the hassle of the massive inventory screen and the repetitiveannoyingtimeconsuming aspect of destroyingselling the multitude of useless items you received
this interesting new inventory management system works by all of the weapons having a weight and if you go over a certain weight limit which is dependent on your character class and certain upgrades you can choose you can face severe power regeneration penalties
i love this idea but it can become annoying when all of the good weapons have really high weight
it also ends up limiting the weapons you can bring along even though i was a vanguard that selected the increase weight capacity upgrade
theres a possible related result where you can no longer carry any heavy weapons like in previous games something that i always loved
instead there are only four heavy weapons found at few certain points lying on the ground flamethrower rocket launcher some geth laser gun and the mininuke with very limited ammo
back to the main weapons that are in this game i loved that bioware brought back the role playing elements present in me guns almost keeping the same names and level presentation
the concept is really smart where you can purchase an upgrade up to level  for each weapon and each weapon addon that you can have two equipped on each gun
the only problems here is that i had enough money so that each time i got a new gun i promptly maxed out the upgrades so the system wasnt as rewarding as it could have been
also with the level of each addon upgrading when you find or buy a new one while i love this it was a little uneven where multiple times i upgraded ones i didnt use while i couldnt find the upgrades for the ones i did regularly use
this whole system could be improved with a few adjustments which is possibly a higher level cutoff limit like in multiplayer could make it so that weapons that you like dont become useless because of their stats later in the game and something that i liked in the first game but disappeared in the sequels
that is a weapon efficiency upgrade system where you could get experience points for every enemy you kill with each weapon type i think this could really increase the rpg feel while keeping all of the action
one more thing with the weapons theres an interesting section of the spectre offices where you have a fire range to test your weapon loadout
i love this idea especially with all of the different weapons but it makes no sense to have it on the citadel instead it should be in the normandy cargo bay
too many times i would upgrade a new weapon only to find i didnt like the way it fired
then there are weapons that i never tried out as their weight was really high and the stats werent the best
so while i may have possibly liked the way they fired now ill never know as i didnt have an opportunity to test them outi was pretty disappointed that no real changes noncosmetic were made to the armor system
its much too basic almost exactly the same as me and i wish there were more options to alter and upgrade your armor
i really kept the same armor for most of the game even later i just made a few adjustments and all i cared about was getting the bonus percentages i wanted
the armor also looked all pretty similar except for the helmets which were mostly pretty goofy looking
finally for the different character classes in this iteration they seem about the same but some new abilities have been added
one of them that i really loved was the new nova attack which was really useful when combined with the biotic charge also i like that its not perfect as it uses up your shields creating an interesting cost versus benefit play choicethe next aspect of the game is one that has really defined to series up to this point and that is the conversation system of me
i was very disappointed that the conversation options were much more limited in this iteration where you basically only had the paragon or renegade choice
there was never a paragade response or something else like the sarcastic comments i loved making in dragon age  at this point in the series it felt like a step back
there was also an annoying amount of conversations that resembled your talks with the dlc characters massani and goto
i didnt mind this too much but it was frustrating when multiple times i would accidently hit the a button one too many times and i would skip the conversation
i also had a few graphics glitches during the normal conversations with choices where the characters framework was broken or glitched and theyd be looking all over the place or the eyes would be tracking wrong it was just really weird
even stranger this tended to happen earlier in the game they either occurred with liara or ravik i didnt really experience it too much later im not sure why
possibly relating to this i didnt have any problems importing my characters face as some have but i think thats because i played around with it in me because i didnt love my shepards facethere were multiple times in conversations where there were great little inside joke comments that were only for my shepard but i was a little disappointed that there werent more new in depth conversations with your crew
even with the new character vega while i love the sparring matchconversation you had with him one of my favorite crew member interactions in the whole series you dont get to know him as much as you did the previous games characters
i understand that with the possibility of almost every old character not being present in me the developer didnt want to spend too much time and money on them but conversely they didnt add many new characters
in total not counting the dlc character there are only four new crew members on the normandy all of whom are humans the new playable jock character a gay male pilot a gay female communications officer and a female reporter
i liked all of these new characters though the reporter is a little generic and annoying but consider something for a minute
if garrus and tali had died in your playthrough of me for most of the game you would only have two playable characters vega and liara
later of course you get kaidanashley and edi but its amazing they didnt add new characters or make more of the characters from me crew members
even with all of the crew members possible you dont get a representative from the krogans and the salarians or any of the other noncouncil races
i expected to see all of the different species send someone onto the normandy but for some reason no one did
all we got was a krogan leader wrex
 a turian leader and a quarian leader in the war room for a few missions
youd think that if bioware didnt want to waste time and money on possibly unpopular characters they would have created more characters that every player would get to know
the only possible explanation for why they didnt do this is that they didnt think they had the time to establish multiple new interesting charactersanother annoying change to something i loved before was how when youre in the hubworld listening to peoples interesting conversations you have to leave the area and come back to hear the next part of the story
in me you could just keep hitting the a button to listen to the rest of the conversation which to me worked really well
this time even though the stories are cool i would lose interest in them as so much time could pass between each part of the telling also at one point they glitched out and all of the conversations reset
i also had a problem that i figure has to be a glitch where at the last conversation with the illusive man the paragon and renegade options were greyed out
with this shepard i have always selected the blue conversation options in each mass effect game every time they appeared and i also always explore every possible conversation option
i had off the charts amounts of reputation and paragon points and still i had a conversation option blocked the first time this has ever happened to me in the mass effect series and every other video game with a similar conversation system
i felt extremely confused and annoyed that somehow the best possible resolution to the illusive man conflict wasnt available to me for no apparent reasononto the locations and exploration of the different worlds something that was one of my favorite parts of the previous games but is almost nonexistent in me
here is where me strikingly reminds me of the failure of dragon age  similarly to kirkwall the citadel acts as the only hubworld in the entire mass effect  game while in me there were four completely different hubworlds
this would be okay as most worlds are under attack from the reapers except for the fact that this version of the citadel is the smallest and most basic of the entire mass effect trilogy
then the citadel only goes through a very minor cosmetic change halfway through the game and they expect us a society full of adhd people not to grow bored of the surroundings
we get to go to worlds weve always wanted to explore like the turian salarian quarian asari and human homeworlds but all of them are filled with waist high walls and theyre all being blown up by reapers andor attacked by cerberus
the missions are also relatively short and we fail to really see anything unique about the planets
further me has essentially eliminated the mini missions on random worlds and the probe mechanic found in me
instead now you have to fly around each system evading the reapers while you randomly scan for  or  of the interesting things which are either small amounts of fuel or some random unexplained war asset on a planet
then you get to play a few basic solo n missions on the limited number of multiplayer maps
i understand that exploring alien worlds isnt a priority in the middle of a war with a group of ancient syntheticorganic hybrid monster spaceships but i missed this aspect that was hugely present in the previous gamesrelated to the locations and explorations im going to talk a little bit about the further development of the alien species you encounter
sadly we see very little new aspects of the previously introduced alien species and no new aliens
one thing we do see is our first krogan female who is a very cool character though the time spent with her is short
also you dont see too much of the krogan woman but this kind of makes sense when you consider the krogan society
once again every other species females are nonexistent i guess bioware believes the asari provide enough females for everyone
also i can explain away why we dont see many of the other races females though we probably should see them as refugees or scientists but i find it weird that we dont see any turian females
from garrus previous stories it has been established that females can serve in their military and can compete with the best of the males also theyre apparently very flexible but dont have much reach
the one new design that bioware were extremely successful in creating was that of the prothean
they succeeded in looking like the collectors and were just extremely cool
i loved even more the reality of what their culture was in comparison to what everyone had believed
the only problem is that for some reason bioware decided to make this important and awesome character firstday dlc
finally the worst aspects of the new alien design in me are the quariansi either wanted bioware to keep the quarians faces secret or i wanted a beautiful scene to show off talis true face they even had the perfect situation when they are on her home planet of rannoch
instead bioware was lazy and they just had tali give a picture to shepard that he could keep in his cabin
this picture showed a poorly photoshopped stock photo of a cute human woman that probably took an hour or two to make
every single piece of tali fan art ive seen is a hundred times better than what bioware chose
since turians and quarians are so closely related same amino acid structure then they would probably look more similar to each other instead of being human except for some tattoos and different hands
of course they would be also be different in many ways the turian world experienced a lot of radiation which caused them to develop the armor plates and there was something about the quarians where they have a symbiosis with the plant life on their world and because of this their immune systems werent fully developed this was then made worse by years and years spent on sterile space ships
even if bioware wanted a mostly human design to appease tali fans which there is some precedent for as the eyes and nose appear human behind the mask ive seen much better humanoid designs for tali
i mean its a little strange where fans are more talented and spend more time creating images of a very important design than the official developerheres where im going to stick a bunch of the random features in the game
i was a bit surprised by the complete elimination of minigames in me while they were all a little annoying before instead of fixing them now they just removed them and the doorssafes take a little longer to open implying that youre automatically performing some type of hack or bypass
the reputation system is a much appreciated additionadaptation where you get standard reputation points for performing moral neutral actions and every paragon or renegade point adds to your total
because of this players are no longer punished from not being an absolute character and no matter you preference if you have enough reputation points both of the paragon and renegade conversation choices are unlocked
however it is pretty goofy how the bar is filled up very early into the game i was still getting lots of points but there was no visual interpretation of the increase
i almost wish there was a bigger bar or even a numerical presentation of all of your reputation points
another new addition to this game is the war assets and effective military strength ems
i really liked this feature as everything youve done in the mass effect series is represented here
however once again the bar fills up incredibly early in the game
theres also some really disturbing about the ems and thats the aspect of galactic readiness which can only be increased by playing multiplayer
so if you hate coop multiplayer or if you dont have enough money or the ability to have an xbox live gold membership your galactic readiness is locked at 
this means that all of your war assets will be halved for the emf
so lets look at my level i had  points with a galactic readiness hovering around 
if i wouldnt have played multiplayer then i would have only had  emf points which is enough to get the endings but is not enough to get the best ending
to put this in perspective i played every mission available except for a few that glitched out on me
the only things that might have lowered my war assets were that in me i saved the council in me i destroyed the collector base even though for the story cerberus still found most of it intact and in me i cured the krogan genophage which annoyed the salarians
one other random thing in me you dont have someone like kelly that will take care of your fish
the only option is to buy a crazy expensive aquarium vi and if you dont your fish will die even if you feed them every chance you get
youd think edi would be able to monitor your fish tank for free but i guess itd be a little degrading considering her new role as a crew member on herselfnow onto the last aspect of the game that isnt the story and that is the newly added coop multiplayer
i was initially concerned about this aspect of the game but ive had a lot of fun playing with it
i did have a lot of problems with the ea servers the first couple of days though and this was exasperated by the fact that you only get experience and credits by either successfully completing the mission or by dying
i wish that the game would save your experience after each wave especially when any expendable items you use before you disconnect are lost forever
after this i also glitched out a couple times once i got stuck in a wall but i was actually still able to kill a bunch of the enemies while some of them were unable to get me
another time i glitched out during multiplayer it was much worse and much weirder where the whole stage was shaking like i was in the middle of an earthquake
then while i was running i ended up floating in the air for a few feet before falling through the floor i actually have a video of it but its kind of crappy since i couldnt find my camera and used my ipod
sadly or thankfully my team members were a capable bunch even though it was a silver reaper mission and were able to beat the  waves though it took like  minutes where i just had to float there in nothingness and wait
the even weirder thing was that i could damage some of the enemies with biotic powers and the enemies were able to kill me
however once i died i would immediately come back to life
looking past the glitches i love leveling up the different characters and with a group of capable players the missions can be very fun
however after a while i grew a little bored playing the missions theyre all just too similar
then i worked really hard on maxing out the vanguard branch but when i hit level  to get the achievement i promoted the soldiers
this is a cool idea but i wish there was more of a reward for this or possibly the ability to still use the high level characters when attempting a gold level mission or at the very least a new character plus where they get an extra bonus so youre not starting from the very beginning of the character
the biggest problem i have with the multiplayer though is that ea decided to for the first time in a aaa console game to include a freemium pricing structure for the locked characters weapons and items
i actually find this kind of offensive as i could play the multiplayer for hours and get a random pack someone else could get immediately by shilling out two dollars
i especially have a problem with this pricing as you could spend two dollars on a pack and get nothing you could use
if youre going to charge for items others could get by just playing the game i think you should be able to pick items although of course it would make it even more unfair for people that dont want to be tricked into paying for items that are already in the game
i think that the multiplayer could be saved with a patch and possibly more game modes than the  waves that always feature the play modes capture the flag secure the base headhunt certain enemies and kill everything moving
as it currently stands i cant see this multiplayer establishing a consistent faithful base for anything nearing long termnow i can finally get to the aspect of the game that had me the most upsetfrustrated and that is the story
from here on in warning there be major spoilers ahead
right from the start of the game the story is goofy
a minute after our first look at the me universes earth the reapers attack not giving the player any time to acclimate to the game
then a little later after a goofy childs death that will haunt shepard for the rest of the game you are introduced to the games one and only plot device blueprints for an allpowerful weapon designed but not completed by the protheans called the crucible
this is just so generic and out of the blue it doesnt make any sense but i was ok with playing along
you then have a mission involving each of the previous me games characters some small and some large
the developers then proceed to kill off two of my favorite characters in these missions mordin and thane
however i can accept their deaths especially since it was established previously that both of them were near death old age and lung disease respectively and both of them were done very well they had good deaths
i admit that i felt serious emotion with both of them and i may or may not have cried through the whole hospital scenei have a lot of problems with the development of cerberus as the main antagonist in a game about the reapers
i understand that bioware wanted to provide different enemies to face and i admit that their ai and designs are excellent
however i dont understand how cerberus became so powerful
every time you see them theyre a step ahead of you even when you kill hundreds or thousands of their heavily armed and trained troops
later they kind of explain this by establishing that they created a refugee sanctuary that was actually a human harvesting and indoctrination factory but it still doesnt quite add up
i didnt love cerberus in me and things theyve done had always been on the border of indecency and terrorism but it usually seemed to be in humanitys best interest
however in me theyre all crazy and doing absolutely horrible incomprehensible things bioware tries to say its all because tim has been slowly indoctrinated and hes now under control of the reapers but i never really thought they successfully established this
probably the goofiest cerberus plot line is the coup of the citadel which made absolutely zero sense
they somehow gained control of udina who while being a douche bag didnt have any connections to cerberus and had no reason to betray the rest of the council and managed to infiltrate the citadel which is supposed to be the safest and most guarded place in the galaxy they even again said they upgraded the security
then they for some reason wanted to assassinate the entire council for reasons that are never explainedup until around halfway through the game i didnt love the story but i was in love with the game and having a lot of fun playing it
i mean the actual story for me was pretty basic and goofy but i still absolutely loved the game
then after the previously mentioned cerberus coup of the citadel i received the first realization that bioware might not care about their fans or that they might possibly even hate us
previously in the citadel you met up and talked to kelly chambers in the refugee camp
there was a great little scene where after asking if she wants to rejoin the normandy she describes the horror she experienced on the collector ship and that she cant be on the normandy as it reminds her of what she faced
instead shes helping the refugees coming into the citadel
i loved this little interaction and i thought it was great fan service for people that liked kelly
then after the coup when walking around the refugee camp you hear two people talking and they basically say have you seen that red headed woman who was helping out so much
you didnt hear
a cerberus soldier came up asking if she was kelly chambers and after she said yes he just shot her in the head
huh i guess if cerberus asks you if youre someone you should just say no
hah hah hah
this was a character i spent the whole of me talking to and growing to care about and bioware decided to kill her off so disrespectfully and unnecessarily i was just absolutely horrified
i wished i could have never heard that conversation but no it will now always be in my brainafter this point everything was ok not perfect but i pretty much enjoyed all of the events and there were some truly awesome kickass scenes i loved the fight where you called on the mother of all thresher maws and the brokering of peace between the quarians and geth until the final battle to retake earth
the whole strategy for retaking earth was a little goofy but i didnt mind it too much
there was also a great area where before the final battle you walk around the camp and talk to all of your party members and you can even call and talk to the previous games characters that arent playable in me
the conversations are a little short but i enjoyed all of them
then after fighting for a while you get to the beam to take you to the citadel which was overtaken by the reapers without any explanation of how  you can assume billions of people were killed and everything breaks apart in a million pieces
you know the developer did something wrong when fan created explanationsinterpretations make more sense than what we were actually given the most logical being that the whole citadel sequence was an indoctrinated dream
other people have more succinctly examined and explained all of the different problems and plot holes so i wont go too in depth here
nevertheless you are apparently hit by the reapers laser beam that destroys everything it touches but here you only get some melted armor and a beat up face
you also receive a very powerful heavy pistol with unlimited ammo that you use to kill the reaper creations between you and the teleportation beam
when you get to the beam and are transported to the citadel somehow both the illusive man and anderson beat you to the main room
theres this whole thing where somehow tim is able to control your body and make you shoot anderson but you are able to break control and kill timafter ascending the elevator to the merged crucible and citadel console a godlike ai in the form of the dead child from earth appears
here bioware for some reason decides to give you more questions instead of providing the player with any answers
the godchild says that the reapers are his answer to the problem that synthetic life pure order will eventually completely wipe out all organic life pure chaos
basically the reapers were created to save organic life from synthetics by murdering and harvesting every developed race each  years a synthetic being created hybrids to kill organics to save them from being killed by synthetics
through this whole interaction shepard acts completely subjugated and accepts everything the child says as absolute truth
you are finally given three options you can control the reapers presented as the blue or paragon choice even though it was represented by tim who was at least a renegade character you could destroy the reapers along with all synthetic life presented as the red or renegade choice even though it was represented by anderson who was absolutely a paragon character or you could take the third option which would merge all organic and synthetic life presented by no one but this is obviously the choice that the godchild ai wants
then no matter what choice you make as long as your war assets are beyond a very small level shepard dies the reapers leave earth or are destroyed every mass relay is destroyed hopefully in a way different than what was seen in the arrival dlc or entire systems might have been wiped out of existence and the normandy after joker apparently flees the battle on earth just barely escapes the blast and crash lands on an edenlike planet with characters that were just with you rushing the beam somehow being magically transported to the normandythen thats it the game is over except for a ridiculous conversation featuring a starchild and an old man taking place in a forest that resembles the one in shepards dream and a flash of shepard taking a breath if you had enough ems and chose to destroy the reapers
oh also theres an insulting message telling you to buy the future dlc bioware releases and youre set up back on the normandy before the raid on the cerberus base
i literally walked all around the normandy trying to talk to everyone and it felt like i was in a different dimension it was just so weird and awkward
the only real difference between the three endings is the color of the beam the crucible emits and the explosion that follows
when faced with the choice i watched each ending on youtube and decided on the greensynthesis ending
partly because it was the weirdest but mostly because edi and joker embrace in that end and if i had to die  the universe had to be irreversibly changed most likely leading to many of the stranded races on earth dying of starvation and never seeing their homes or loved ones at least someone could find some happiness in this endingso why am i and almost every mass effect fan outraged at the endings bioware gave us
in one poll found on the official mass effect forums  of around  fans hated the ending and wants bioware to change it completely and  still wanted the ending slightly adjusted
first and foremost the ending is so bleak and depressing that there is no opportunity for happiness or even a sense of accomplishment that should come with beating a video game
ive never before played a game that punished me for beating it
then there are so many plot holes with weird and abrupt revelations that make no sense
however the biggest problem with the ending is that no choice that you made in all three games has any bearing on the outcome
as long as your shepard didnt die in me and you have the minimum amount of war assets or ems in me you get the same ending as someone that worked hard in each mass effect game and created their perfect shepard story maxing out all of the meters doing all of the missions
i wouldnt have liked any ending where shepard dies but i could have accepted it if it was well done and provided closure instead of just appearing to be the crumpled pieces of paper that a writer with any talent would have thrown into the trashthe prevailing sense of hopelessness despair and depression was never before found in the mass effect games
even though you faced suicide missions if you did everything right only one of your team members died in the games and the overall mission was always essentially a complete success there were always a large amount of casualties but they were all blank faces
i really cant see how anyone at bioware would have liked this ending
ive come to the conclusion that either bioware doesnt care about their long term fans hates their long term fans or are so stupid that they thought the fans would actually like the ending they provided or possibly a fourth option where theyre just being trolls and the whole ending was a dream sequence and the true ending is being released as dlc although i would probably associate this option as aligning closely to they dont care aboutmass effect  is a very fun game for the first  hours or so
unfortunately the writing team decided to get cute with the ending of the space opera and the endings such as they are are a wasteland of plotholes inconsistencies and themes that run contrary to the entire design of the series never mind many of the main themes of the third game itselfits a cogent reminder that even a team of creatives that is capable of producing the fantastic series that was mass effect is nevertheless capable of stumbling and stumbling badly nay horribly in the endso ive been a fan for the entire series
i couldnt wait to play the me and really wasnt let down
i was moved to anger and even neartears more than once
thats a good game in my book  the writing for the me games is nothing short of awesome
they manage to inspire a wide range of reactions through the scripted interactions
further there is more true actionchoice tracking in me than in some other decision based games
characted know and react to your choices commenting logically as a human would
i dig that
if you killed off ash after bangin her people comment on it later
go figure  the game play is improved mostly
im not one to complain about things like this unless they are just completely tragic
me games have always been challenging to play and  is no exception
you adapt to the systems that are provided and move on  the length of the game is something of a let down for me
it could very well be that i am basing this off of my last plays through  and  with all that dlc so my perception might be a little jaded here
but still i was surprised when i reached the final fighting stagesoverall i loved this game as i did  and as for the controversial ending you know mass effect has had a way of really drawing people in through the story
it was engaging it was personal
i think that because of this people are really taking the current ending as an afront
well
whatever
i would have prefered an ending that i could have gotten all happy about and cheered for  but the one that is in the game now is no less as powerful
not every courageous life ends well and not every hero gets a happy ending
for those who cant deal with any deviation from the happy ending  well i think it says more about them than it does the gameit maybe isnt going to change anytime soon but i hope more gamers wake up and fight against this dlc market thats destiny to doom the gaming industry
keep the protest alive
i also heard this game has terrible framerate issues on the ps and occasional freezingthe masseffect trilogy was awesome
sure the ending doesnt culminate everything from part  and  which is what bioware originally promised
we were supposed to have save data that transfered to each sequal and effect the climactic finale and it just didnt happen
i am upset but so what
all three games were great
mass effect  had some of the best missions characters drama intrigue etc
of any game ever made
its a classicyou have probably read the reviews that highlight the travesty that is this games ending
the reality is this is a series that overwhelmingly depends on player choice forming the story line
abandoning that dynamic at the end of the series makes the entire exercise pointless
that said the only thing this series really has going for it is the story telling
once you remove that or look beyond the fantasy
what you are left with is at best a very mediocre shooter or a outright anemic attempt at a role playing game
with an absurd amount of time sinks which have no real entertainment valuethere are simply better options to avail yourself of in either genre
mass effect  as a shooter takes turns at being maddening and yet tedious at the same time
the combat is based around a cover system married to a shield based system
meaning that combat can be underwhelming
except for the times when the controls cause mishaps like jumping cover saddling up to the side of cover or gasp walking away from cover randomly
that would be bad on the whole but it can become infuriating in some scenarios where overpowered enemies are thrown at you or worse you contend with a endless drill of them
so you will go through hours of mind numbing repetition only to find yourself getting hung up in a arena like area for upwards of an houron the role playing side of the equation the situation is even bleaker
the entire system is based around making tradeoffs that equal out regardless of your play style
meaning that you only have the appearance of choice
even then it boils down to a choice of a or b this applies equally for skills and equipment
there is just no room for thought or individualization
it really speaks to a contempt for the player
this developer isnt known for having a comprehensively deep system but this is about as shallow as the pool gets
with two previous outing in this series
it should have seen marked improvement but in the end it has actually gotten much worseto summarize you have a story development based game which not only gets castrated at the end but is also just plain unabashed about ripping other franchises off
it isnt homage when you rip entire scenes from movies and television series
so the story is pretty pathetic regardless of whether your choices matter or not
other then that you just have a very weak shooter with some pointless role playing elements tacked on top for i guess some kind of nostalgia purposeabout all that can be said for the game is that it isnt utterly horrible
it is playable even if the elements in part or whole are entirely unremarkable
you will get about thirty hours out of this title with little to no real replay value
so i recommend waiting to buy used or the price comes down
with the way this games image is flagging it should go without saying that the market will see a influx of copies
this is a game that may be say worth twenty dollars but definitely not sixty dollarsso i could go on and on about how great mass effect  and mass effect  were
i think most people know this already
basically ill state that the reason mass effect  is the way it is is because ea is the way that it is
that is its a company primarily in business for the numbers
eas sole interest is how many games they can make fly off the store shelves
they dont really care if the game is good bad or just plain awful
to them it makes no nevermindwhat matters to the ea bean counters is that you plop down  for it and then  here and  there for dlc
thats what matters
mass effect  is the poster child of exactly how ea operates its gaming divisions
ea demands its gaming divisions to deliver when they want it delivered not when the game is ready or when the game is complete
its clear also that bioware has been gutted of any creative spark that was there when kotor and later when mass effect  was released
its also clear that ea has forced bioware to dumb down and scale back what mass effect is so they can get it out fasteras for mass effect  this game tries to play like mass effect  and  but fails on so many levels
the environments are small there are few side quests and what is there is so directed it might as well be a rail shooter
when youre on board the normandy you can hop from star system to star system collecting things but too has been removed the mining parts from mass effect  dumbing this game down substantially
you can still search for things but only what the game wants you to search forthe relationship building aspect is still mostly kept intact again dumbed down and scaled back
so at least thats somewhat there
there are question and response pieces that seem to be leading somewhere but really dont
the choices you make seem like they might do something but again do nothing
the war assets you collect do nothing
in the end none of anything that you have done throughout the game or indeed any of the games makes any difference to the conclusion
it still ends up the same and its not all that impressive at thatso just chalk mass effect  up to eas bean counters
again me is effectively the poster child for everything that is wrong with eas business strategy
by playing this game you will understand why when ea takes game companies over their franchises dont live long under ea
if this franchise manages to survive at all it will become a hollow vapid shell of what it once was and me is already displaying this
its likely that the next mass effect game released ends up being some kind of mediocre arcadestyle firstperson zombie shooter so that there is nothing left in common with this franchise but the name
thats also one of eas strategies
basically they will use the name until it cant be used any more no matter what genre the game is
they just want your oh well so much for bioware begins playing tapsgreat game terrible ending
for all the hype about the plethora of endings possible from the literally dozens if not hundreds of decisions made through the  games you basically end up with  ending and it sucksthe story is incredible and ends with an all encompassing end now
on first release the ending was a let down but i have played it  times and loved each play through
multiplayer just kept getting better
the best multiplayer set up since halo
bioware really made a game series that will be nearly impossible to besti have never played a role playing game that was so engaging
i have no problem playing this game over and over and over
i decided to get this game after play mass effect  which i thoroughly enjoyed very much
you can actually feel for these charactors
i told my son that i will not be buying any addon through xbox live but after playing these gamesi changed my mind
i will be getting all the addons
i tip my hat off to all that participated in making the trilogy
it is funny romantic action packed good story scifi artisically beautiful
the liara and shepard are the best
cant get enough of themupdatei dont know but the center of the  games disc cracked
is it me or has this happened to anyone else
i am wondering if the disc was cheaply made
or maybe i roughed it up taking it our of the case
i do love playing this game and the others reasons the ending ruins the game brevity it is confusing and underdeveloped lore errors plot holes key philosophical themes are discarded player choice is completely discardedi gave this such a low score simply because the ending was a slap in the face to fans and i say ending because instead of the promised  different endings we got one generic ending with different colors
i wont spoil anything here but it was a travesty
it would have been fine if the three endingswhich were basically all the same exact thing were one of the options but not all of the options
im not asking for shepard to end up in a field of daisies with his crew just want an ending that makes some sense
bioware dropped the ball big time and i wont be purchasing another one of their products until this is remediedupdatei finally decided to give the extended cut a chance i realize there are some glaring flaws in it as well but it is a ton better than it was
i am raising my rating to a  star because of bioware and them listening to us fans
they could have left us high and dry with nothing but at least they triedi like the game
there was a lot of complaints of the ending but with that new patch it did kinda explain it more
they could have done a better job at the ending though i wont lie
but the journey to the ending was amazing it was really exciting
the only thing that sucks is that the mass effect story is finally over but the maker say that there will be a new  me story with new characters sometime in the futureme was a great game
best graphics best game play best everything
i know a lot of people are complaining about the ending and yes it was a crappy ending
but the game is worth playing why let  mins of game destroy the whole thing
dont get me wrong yes i complained to ea and bioware because it was not normal for the ending to be like that seemed rushed but the hour upons hours of gameplay you get our of this game are exceptionali would recommend this to anyone that loved the first  just be prepared for the ending to not live up
the story line was great the battles were better then ever
i thought me was easy on the battles so glad they made it harder on me
you will love this game if you loved the other   all games have faults and this one has its fault but it is worth playing
and maybe they made it that way for a reason
i dont know
but i loved the game over all and dont see the point of leaving  star just because after hours and hours of playing i didnt like the last  mins
overall the game is a  star
buy it and enjoy itin a nutshell me is me liteif you enjoyed me and never played me you will enjoy me but if you have played me then me will seem very watered downfirstly the locations are recycled from me and then watered down for example the citadel in me was a playable location in me it is a static set
every time you go there the exact same people are in the same spots saying the same linesthe ship hasnt even gotten a fresh coat of paint
and now after every mission you are in a war room and have to walk down a useless hallway to get to the ships command center whyin true bioware fashion the boss battles are huge spikes in difficulty i guess to make up for lack of imagination
and quite annoying and needlessly frustratingto their credit i havent had any show stopping bugs but no one mentions that the  version is on  disks and every once in a while the game terrorizes you with disk changes
one night i had no changes and another  night i had  yes five disk changes
ps
the game is installed on my hard drivei regret that i purchased this game it is definitely a rental if at allas usual this will be a nospoiler reviewending although everyone is complaining how awful the ending was they never did look at the positives
while the ending is somewhat limited by choice it still brought a tear to my eye and is still my favorite game trilogy
rather than look at the negatives i looked at the positive storyline and the recurrent theme that the ending produced in the series
while the ending was not perfect it is not bad enough to cause the whole game to receive a one or two star review
such reviewing is merely immature
the ending leaves the player still wanting more but at the same time somewhat satisfied which is the reaction i am sure bioware was hoping to get atgameplay the gameplay is definately an upgrade
simplistic controls matched with advanced covering and movements made the game fun to play
while the enemies seemed somewhat repetative they probably have the most diversity compared to the previous two games
health does not fully recharge as it did in mass effect  so players will also have to be a bit more cautious
i found the enemies rather fun to take on and the game overall was challenging but funmultiplayer the multiplayer is nothing to write home about but it is worth trying out
you simply work with a squad and take on various enemies
of course it is rather flawed
for one if your team plays badly everyone suffers
also hosting issues occur frequently
it is also somewhat repetative and i cant play it for more than a few rounds before becoming rather boredgraphics these graphics do not compare to those of games such as la noire but they are still pretty good
again a good game shouldnt rely on good graphics however bioware managed to create a balancestory the story was excellent and it was exciting seeing my choices from the previous two games effect situations that occured in this game
it was heartbreaking and thrilling to play through the story as many friends died and much excitment occurs
this game was honestly more thrilling than mass effect  there were a lot of side missions and overall the game took me about  hours to beat including the dlcdlc the from ashes dlc is actually pretty important
while it may not seem like much i found that the prothean javik revealed a lot about the previous cycle and had some effects to how the story played out
plus it was pretty cool fighting alongside an extinct speciesoverall overall i give the game an  out of  while some may have found the ending disapointing i merely saw it as a challenge to play the entire series over again on insanity difficulty
i enjoyed the ride and though the ending is not what i expected i would relive it all over againafter mass effect  and  i was very excited for this game
unfortunately bioware decided they didnt care and released a cheep and unfinished gamethe ending has nothing to do with the three previous gamesthe ending is nothing but choosing door   or the final image is just a silhouette photoshopped over an old desktop  talis picture is a poorly edited stock photo  just play me or  again
they are great this game is trashbioware did you know i love you
whats that
nono its okayshhhshhhcome here i wont be rough i promise
whats that its too soon
weve been at this for more than four years i think its time to make it official
ii dont know how you do it bioware but my only conclusion is that you are either made out of stardust or your just my rpgsnpirationfantastic game that brought a great trilogy to an end
highly recommend it to anyone who has played the first despite some notable and serious failings mass effect  is a fantastic title on the whole and for the most part constitutes a worthy entry in one of the most ambitious and original series to grace the medium of video gaming
perhaps the first thing fans should know about mass effect  is that it is faithful to the conventions of its predecessors with regards to gameplay and storytelling
this is of course a major point in the games favor
whereas dragon age  also a bioware game represented a major departure from nearly everything i loved about its predecessor in mass effect  you will find the same basic elements that made mass effect and mass effect  great outstanding characters memorable dialogue decent plot twists quality combat outlandish fighting abilities and lush hub environments
you can still wander the gorgeous citadel presidium buying items and overhearing conversations and resolving conflicts can still launch a circuitfrying overload or devastating singularity at foes can still trek through the corridors of your ship the normandy to talk to your teammates and admire the drive core and organize your equipment
if these core features made you fall in love with the first and second games then you certainly will not want to miss experiencing them all over again here
i imagine that newcomers to the series would also appreciate such things in mass effect  though i strongly recommend that they play through the previous entries or at least pick up mass effect  firstunfortunately it is true that the biggest defect in me is its conclusion
in a turn reminiscent of lost and battlestar galactica there is little narrative forethought in evidence and satisfying closure is shunted in favor of a quick vague metaphysical and sloppy ending
not only do your previous choices largely fail to come into play but further the major gameending decision you are given has only the smallest influence on the brief and unsatisfying final cutscene
like many longtime fans i found myself left with a surprisingly powerful  feeling of disappointment
while any conclusion to a long entertainment experiencebe it a book series or a tv series or a movie trilogytends to leave one with a sense of loss this lingering emotion really ought to be more bittersweet and less purely bitter than what i now feel
i do not think that the basic idea underlying the ending was intrinsically stupid with a little extra work the major plot details could have been kept but simply told in a more compelling way
bioware should have made an effort to mimic the epilogue of dragon age origins which consisted of a simple dialogueheavy celebratory ceremony and a series of written descriptions explaining how your choices affected the future of the realm
surely the time and resources spent creating two or three of mes missions could have instead been dedicated toward cobbling together a far more respectable ending along these linesa few other problems with the game are worth mentioning
for one the cast of playable teammates has been significantly reduced to a maximum of seven including the obnoxious firsttimer james vega an uninteresting meathead
perhaps the superb twelveperson team of mass effect  spoiled me somewhat but whatever the reason i cant shake the sense that more squad characters would have made the game richer
additionally mass effect  appears to do very little to acknowledge or incorporate decisions that are ported from meme playthroughs limiting itself mostly to references in conversation or occasionalthough reasonably satisfying and wordycharacter cameos
this shouldnt be a surprise since the second game was much the same way but its disappointing that the promise of a dataporting trilogy didnt amount to much in the end
hell the original mass effect had a subplot for each of shepards three possible background stories
would it have killed them to throw in a few similarly contextexclusive quests or missions based on what you did to the council andor the collectors
i should also point out that me makes the poor choice of providing several romance options that do not include sex scenes
apparently only some of the available characters you can romance actually lead to relatively fullfledged corresponding sex sequences
maybe im a pervert for caring but these sequences have been something of a staple of the series so i felt a bit jilted pun intended when i discovered that i wouldnt get to see one just because i had chosen the wrong love interest
finally i was disappointed by the ridiculously overbloated role played by the shady prohuman organization cerberus in the game
you end up fighting them in perhaps  of your missions and their degree of wealth influence and knowledge is irritatingly absurd in the context of the storyline
this is symptomatic of mass effect s general tendency to incorporate some poor writing from time to time as with the opening sequence on earth and the overuse of the illsacrificemyselftocompletethemission action clicheacuteto be sure this is a game that has legitimate flawshoweverand this is an important howeverthere are certain areas in which me reaches new heights of storytelling for the series surpassing its predecessors and incorporating narrative devices that are to my knowledge unique in the field of video gaming
in particular i was impressed by the use of certain tiny but wellexecuted details in order to truly impress upon the player that the galaxy is at war and war is hell
i hope that im not spoiling too much by delving into specifics here but there are a number of small changes that take place in the citadel the games hub area and the seat of galactic politics and culture throughout mass effect  that provide the strongest illustration of my point
when you first arrive there after escaping the attack on earth the general attitude of its inhabitants is shockingly relaxed and complacent
sure there are a few refugees present but for the most part the war is only touching lives in distant ways
you overhear the chatter of a wealthy volus arms dealer looking to make a profit off the war of a military wife cheating on her husband and contemplating how to break the news to him and of a turian soldier saying farewell to his wife insisting that he is unlikely to see combatinitially i was incensed by the ridiculous apathy of the citadels denizens
how could things be so subdued here while earth was being bathed in fire and destruction
but then as the game progressed i began to notice subtle differences the refugee camp grew the bureaucratic lines became longer and the conversations slipped toward darker and darker topics
by the end of the game matters turn truly black with throngs of refugees keeping vigil at a massive wall covered in photographs of the dead or missing dozens of injured soldiers and civilians littering the floor of the hospital and scattered widows crying silently as friends or strangers reach out to console them
a panicked salarian tries to empty his bank account so that he can flee medical personnel struggle to acquire adequate supplies an asari breaks down when you hand her a recording of her lovers last words pulled off of a corpse you found littering some battlefield
biowares writers have transformed the simple presence of a hub worlda staple of many rpgsinto a chillingly atmospheric exploration of the horrors of war
indeed mass effect  achieves this effect in a deeper way than many of the war novels i have read and war movies i have seen because it allowed me to interact with its world actively as a player rather than passively as a mere reader or viewera few other solid innovations made me stand out
as many gamers and critics have noted the rpg elements have finally been effectively balanced in this entry
while mass effect drowned the player in a tidal wave of upgrade items and mass effect  featured a grossly oversimplified framework that allowed for virtually no customization mass effect  finds a satisfying harmony between these two extremes
each weapon can be equipped with two upgrades and any upgrades you own are updated automatically
for example if im using a sniper rifle equipped with a level iii scope that improves its accuracy and i buy a level iv scope from a store on the citadel then that level iv upgrade is instantly applied to my sniper rifle without any hassle or redundant inventory items
entire weapons too can be easily upgraded to improve their damage accuracy and ammo capacityas in i can upgrade from a mattock heavy rifle i to a mattock heavy rifle ii and so on
i also thought that the moral choices in mass effect  while not necessarily mindbendingly brilliant were more complex and ambiguous than those of any other bioware game i have played
i was often forced to make splitsecond and sometimes traumatic decisions or take sides in legitimately difficult political debates
should i support weapons sales to civilians during the war
should i allow the citadels police force to illegally access business video feeds in order to search for traitors
should i recommend that the hospital staff begin harshly rationing their provisions in order to prepare for future shortages
even the muchdespised ending of the game resisted giving the player a clear choice between good and evila fact which deserves some small praise in my viewin sum mass effect  has its share of pros and cons alike
yes the ending is a genuine disappointment the playable cast is small the game doesnt do much to acknowledge your decisions from me or me and the nonexplicit romances are almost as annoying as cerberus inflated role in the storyline
but at the same time this epic third title delivers all of the classic elements that have defined the mass effect series from the start even as it breaks new narrative ground refines its upgrade system and incorporates a substantial number of mature moral dilemmas
i understand that many feel betrayed by the last hour or so of play but i think it would be a huge mistake to write off the entire game on that basis alone
mass effect  sucked me in
if you are a video gamer you deserve to pick yourself up a copy of this title and set aside a week to lose yourself again in biowares vibrant and immersive science fiction universeas a big fan of bioware games and mass effect in particular it was really important for the trilogy to come to a great conclusion
mass effect  doesnt disappoint
an excellent battle system terrific writing and voice work and a decisive ending wraps it up neatlyif you are familiar with the series this entry takes the familiar feel and expands on it
all of your previous decisions from the earlier games in the series can be imported to give weight to all of the choices that you have made
the optional dlc adds some great pieces to the story and i would really recommend getting those as wellthe multiplayer was the one part that i had reservations about going in but i was really surprised by the quality
the squad based horde mode was simple to pick up but has plenty of depth and replayability through the many characters and weapons that can be unlocked
i spent many more hours playing the multiplayer than i did the actual story itself and now consider it to be one of the best parts of the gamemass effect  does a wonderful job of tying a bow on the story of commander shepard
the burning questions get answered the story is riveting from start to finish and the multiplayer will keep you coming back for more
perfectthe game was great the day one dlc was good but the ending was so bad i wanted to cryi was a mass effect fan until the disaster that is this games ending and therefore the trilogys ending ruined it for me
its a series based on choice and in the end youre forced into essentially one ending that is highly disappointing
i am sad to say i found the endings there are slight variations for lack of a better word annoyingi have worked in the customer service industry for many years
the managers always stressed that the last person the customer will see either imprints a positive or negative impression
this impression will be the memory that the customer will remember most vividly and if it was negative it wont matter if the rest of the customers time in the store was positive
this was my feeling about mass effect adding to my feelings of negativity i am very angered that bioware decided unilaterally to make my charactera paragon into a war criminal
by destroying the mass relays commander shepard destroyed an unknown number of solar systems
kotaku summarized it bestdestroying the relays nullifies not only the major decisions shepard has made but even the mission she undertook
the reapers did not harvest all life shepard murdered it instead eradicating not only all the principal civilized worlds of her time but also any primitive cultures unlucky enough to live near a mass relay
no matter how you might want to rationalize the destruction of the mass relays the codex placed an emphasis on what will happen if a mass relay ruptured
although it has recently been demonstrated that mass relays can be destroyed a ruptured relay liberates enough energy to ruin any terrestrial world in the relays solar system
mass effect  secondary codex the reaper war  desperate measuresi had hopes that bioware would realize their mistake unfortunately it was and is becoming clear that this company will not change their ending
i am not asking for a happy ending as some may allege
i am asking for an ending that respects the series and that respects the fansi have decided to sell my copy at gamestop and will be using the money to support a company cdprojekt the witcher  that respects their fans
the developer responding to criticism of its ending has added a new final act along with other new features
they didnt use surrogates to attack their critics
for pc owners they can get the dlc free and xbox owners like myself we can get the new version of the game when it is released on april thas a huge fan of the series i found this one lacking as time went on and from what ive heard on various forums that im not the only one disappointed
im probably halfway through the game and while it looks and plays amazing the fact that they tried to make you play online multiplayer in order to have an easier time getting the best ending is just a cheap shot thats going to cost them fans
multiplayer should never effect what is normally a single player game
they took the same cheap and vague ending style as deus ex human revolution
this could very well be a coffin nail in the mass effect franchise unless they go online only
what they need to do is what bethesda did with fallout  and make a dlc that adds a further storyline or better ending
wait for this to be used at this rate you should find a ton of them cheap soonhow dare all of you people rate this a bad game just for the ending
it is not fair to give a great game a  or  star just for the ending i will not try and defend the fact that yes the ending was not great but it was not the worst ending i have seen
the gameplay is a step up from me
you can add mods to your guns to make them have more damage add a scope ect the story took me about  hours to complete mostly because i explored a lot
there is a surprizely fun co op hoard mode that is better than any hoard mode i have played you can choose from human players to aliens such as krogans salarins ect
the graphics look great as well the cut scenes look better than ever
the game looks and plays great so i cant see why any mass effect fan would give this game a  star hell i cant see why anyone would give this game a  star
so people who are looking to buy this game please do not get put off by all the bad reviews so the ending was not great but it was not bad either the co op makes up for it i think
i only gave a  star because the ending any less would be crazynot much i can say that hasnt already been said loved the game and the series save for the ending that has countless things wrong with it
its so unmass effect style in that your choices are so limited and your previous choices are irrelevant
closure more choice and interactivity and seeing how your choices affect the ultimate outcome need to be incorporated into this if bioware wants to turn the disaster downwhybecause its what they promised usill keep this review short and leave the ending out of the talk aswell
if you leave the ending out is this a good game
i dont thinkso
i wanted to prove the other reviews wrong and wanted to see the goodin this game but its hard to come by
even the plus points mostly seemto be absence of the boring gameplay factors
i wont have any spoilersin here eitherpros you can import your me character into this game  somewhat the gameplay has its moments despite admiral hacketts interactions the game makes a fair attempt at reflecting choices made in me  me no more annoying miningresearchinggrinding gameplay elements no more sillyridiculous minigames for hacking its nice to see most of the earlier characters returncons its almost  months since the game came out and patch  doesnt fix import the game has a fair share of bugs the voice acting is for lack of a better word lame the dialogue lines are pretty boring a pretty lame attempt was made at showing sacrifices after every mission i have to talk to hackett and navigate through thatsilly screen animation
are you kidding me bioware
did you guys play this gamethe short version a very very disappointing game and i feel ripped off bothfinancially and emotionally
i put in a considerable amount of time towardsthe first two games and now biowareea decided they can give me the fingerid leave a single star except that i did enjoy some of the gameplay in the firsthalfoh the opening cinematics were pretty lame tooedited october  when i first beat mass effect  in march i hated it
the game was very fun but the ending made you feel that none of your choices mattered
since then bioware has released a free downloadable content that adds more to the ending called extended cut
this has made the ending of the game much easier to understand
this is also the reason why i have to rewrite my reviewmass effect   is a great game that i continue to play over and over
i cant get enough of it
the story takes place months after mass effect  shepard has been arrested after the events in the arrival dlc when shepard blew up a batarian planet
heshe has been detained and is awaiting trial back on earth
out of the blue reapers attack and the planet is overwhelmed
admiral anderson helps shepard escape vancouver but ends up having to stay behind
it is now up to shepard to travel across the universe and build an army to fight the reapers
many old teammates and love interests return in this game that many players will lovecertain aspects of gameplay in mass effect  are impacted by choices made in previous games
when starting a new game players with saved files from mass effect and mass effect  are given the option of importing them into mass effect  upon finishing the game a new game option allows players to continue playing after the main story ends starting again with their finished shepard to collect items they missed the first time around
mass effect  has three preset campaign modes action mode story mode and rpg mode
in action mode conversations have automatic replies and a normal combat difficulty
in story mode conversations have manual replies and a minimal combat difficulty
in rpg mode which is reflective of the typical mass effect experience conversations have manual replies and a normal combat difficultyoverall the rpg elements in the game have been improved over those in mass effect  with a more detailed leveling up system and increased weapon customization
players can also customize their weapons with different scopes mods barrels and ammo types
there are  weapon mods total  five per weapon type  and each of them will have multiple power levels to collectmass effect  offers a multiplayer coop mode called galaxy at war
in this mode players are able to play alongside up to three other players online in unique missions that can impact the outcome of the single player campaign
players have the ability to fight against  different races
they are the reapers geth and cerberus collectors have also been added with dlc
battles take place over a choice of more than  maps with  choices of difficulty
they are bronze easy silver normal gold hard and platinum very hard
platinum maps will randomly spawn tank units from random races in addition to the race your fighting against
an example might be a reaper ravager fighting alongside cerberus troops or a geth prime assisting reapers
each map lasts for  rounds with players defending against waves of attack each getting progressively harderi personally love multiplayer
i play it more than single player now
so far bioware has released  multiplayer dlc packs and theyve all been free
new chapters and challenges are steadily added to keep players interested in the game
altogether mass effect  is a very fun game and should not be missedaside from the hugely disappointing ending that changes colors
this game is trash compared to the first two
the journal in this one is a major step backwards from  your choices from the two prior do not impact any major parts of the gamejust like in  it was like hey thanks for saving me see you later
spoiler
the mission on tuchanka where you face the rachni queen
in the original you had the choice of killing the queen or sparing her but no matter what decision you made a rachni queen still appearsat the end of me you have the choice of destroying the human reaper or handing it over to cerberus but not matter what you do it still appears in me on the level with kei leng
the option of rewriting or destroying the geth in  is pointless because you have to rewrite them again in  the game is full of events and missions where your choices become obsolete
the whole concept of overhearing pedestrians in order to bring up a mission to scan a planet for war assets
bioware couldnt make some of those be actual missions
the day one dlc is probably the biggest rip off in the history of gaming considering the hype that this game had before release
bioware knew they could made a few more million off of gamers by not adding it in to begin with since it did get delayed an extra  and a half months
the extra character doesnt really add anything to the story other than when you go to the asari homeworld and find out the gods they worshipped were just the protheans
somehow the collectors who were the main enemy from  were big during the prothean era but werent even mentioned during me
the melee attack is half assed
vega is useless and what happened to all the characters from  all of a sudden they cant join with you for some bs reason
joker falls in love with edi the ai
half assed story that i wouldnt believe if my life depended on it
somehow people can still be petty when faced with extinction
reapers are all of a sudden weaker unlike in me when sovereign easily took out half the fleet fighting it
it was said that  reaper could take out an entire planet yet somehow humanity is putting up a great fight against hundreds if not thousands of them
why do reapers need ground forces
why is humanity such a major threat to the reapers
is shepard that much of a bamf that they have to take out all humans first
the scanning of a system get annoying when you have to constantly run from reapers after  scans
bioware makes you feel left out if you didnt romance liara in  by making ashleykaiden romance subpar and me romance obsolete
apparently everyone overlooked a person still living on eden prime that wasnt humanthe dlc character
this is the smallest complaint i have but i hate it when you refer to marines as soldier and completely jack up the rank structure
soldier sailor airman marine
each branch has is on rank structure do some research bioware activision did it with call of duty  the sole purpose of me was to introduce the illusive man because cerberus plays such a huge role in  which is another thing that every gamer overlooks
why the hell is cerberus going gainst everything cmdr shepard does like trying to prevent the fertile female krogan from going back to the krogan
why did bioware have to add multiplayer to an already working franchise
if it isnt broke dont fix it
all multiplayer really is is a cheap knockoff of gears of war horde mode with horrible controls
once you complete a mission on a planet you can not revisit it
the glitches are annoying but arent too bad but when compared to me its bad
now the ending how in any way is this a good ending
you screw over the entire galaxy
regardless of what bioware says and i have the guide to prove what they claim there is only  ending with  different color red green blue
there are not  endings just one
same cut scenes after you make your final choice just very very slightly adjusted depending on  if you merge control or destroy the reapers
not the epic ending we were promisedworst ending in gaming history
major plot holes
limited party members
completely ubsurb story all you have to do is think about it a little people
do not but this game it will ruin the first  it did for me
i traded in all  for  all of which were collectors editions and  for ps me was a collectors edition
i even gave away all the comic book tie ins because the last k hours of gameplay was just a waste of timei have a feeling some people are going to get all butt hurt bc they arent unbiased  to see all the fault with this game and will take this personallythe mass effect trilogy like many is something i hold dear and have come to cherish over the last five years
in my opinion both mass effects along with the first bioshock and red dead redemption are among the best games of this generation
the choices and characters were so well written and believable and engaging with them made you care for them
though with mass effect  i feel like many betrayed by biowareall the hours i poured into this game the decisions i made all felt pointless at the end of the game
so many questions left unanswered and unfinished i wanted reaper carnage bliss and an ending where shepard gets the aliengirl of hisher dreams and leads the galaxy through the aftermath and recovery of the reapers or something like this where every sacrific and decision paid off yes i like happy endings
the relationships i formed and my love interests what happened to them
many of my favourite characters didnt actually return as squad mates they just basically had cameo roles and many died and nothing could be done about it
though im extremely happy that ashley was back and i could continue my relationship with her yay along with improved cover and shooting mechanics as well as improved weapon customisation than the previous games which impressed mei really hope that bioware responds to all this negative feedback from loyal fans
maybe they should release a reedited ending in a patch or in a future dlc release
please
dont let this defining trilogy end on a note like thisdanglast scene i had in mass effect  was miranda and my guy lying on the bed cuddlingwhere did she gopfffftprobably ran off with morrigan
ahmiranda and morrigan
only in my dreams babygame is great
am savoring it
got its good points and a few bad points but overalloff to save the galaxy yet againa heros work is never doneupdated note am about  hours into it
i still love it
it feels a tad different then the nd game my favorite but i still am enjoying it
i could not stop
for me if i want to keep playing that is all the review i need
only one real complaintit will be over too soon
wish it would go on forever
i will miss the characters
but with this series i will revisit and play over and over from the first game to the last minute of the rd
thanks bioware for many many hours of enjoyment
i have enjoyed the books as wellenjoy everyone and if on  the reapers come to end the world wellwe will be prepared
ha
i can make a head shot very well
dupdatedi changed my star rating after i beat the game
i am completely confused about the ending
i am not even sure wtf i even chose
i feel exactly like i did at the end of the movie  space odyssey
dunnomaybe you have to either be a genius or on drugs to understand that ending
i am rather upset and speechlessmy final update and ultimate conclusioni watched the ending again and listened
trying to fore go the emotions and just listening
i can understand the concept
also i did not know there was a cut scene after the credits
by chance this time i was busy doing something and did not stop game as credits rolled
overall i have enjoyed the series and dont regret playing it
i would have chosen a different ending however to leave fans more satisfied
but without the knowledge as to what if anything bioware plans on doing with the seriesi can not give a complete opinion of the endingupdatei tried playing the game again
i could not get into it
the ending has made the game and the entire series have no replay for me just like da so i stand by my  star reviewupdate i played the dlc just now
i changed my rating from  to  stars
for me the ending was much better albeit not the perfect ending i would prefer
that being saidthis is why i changed it
dlc was free should have ended that way to begin withjust sayin conversation with the catalyst was more involved
i was able to ask deeper questions to get a better understanding of what was what
even thought another choice was givenit would not be a choice i would have chosen even in original ending
but the choice i would have made and did make given the  choices was more explained heart felt and most of all complete
even though my shepard perished he did not do so in vain
he made a difference and that is all i ever wantedi feel more satisfied now
but am still a bit angry that it was not written more completely to begin with so no  star rating
i must admit bioware with this dlchas renewed a little faith with me
but only time will tell if i completely trust them again
at any rate thanks for doing the dlci know it was not mandatorybut is appreciated all the sameive been a lifelong lover of the character driven narrative
in stories in games you name it
its already been said here so many times i wont elaboratethe ending to this game that had so much potential and initial high quality is embarrassing
i can only think thatfor some reasonbiowareea felt rushed towards the end and allowed things to be glossed over
it surely couldnt be the act of a writers actual willing choice after thinking things through my yr old niece would have done betterone potential possibility that i do wonder about howeveris this meant to be some huge cliffhanger
in the classic sense of the old movie style cliffhangers
its the only other thing that makes sense
still even if this were so bioware you caused a lot of fans to lose faith in your product
including myselffor those who have yet to play this game
all i can tell you is dont bother stick with me and  if you cant resist wait till its a bargain bin special
it wont take long this stinker will tank fastwhen you buy mass effect  you get a free online pass which costs  or  points otherwise
i also got this on sale for cheap and its awesomei cant honestly give this game one star because id be being dishonest as most of this game is up there in quality with the best rpgs of all time
however to mess up an ending so badly to such a great game is a huge travesty that will have impact on bioware and ea for years to come
please dont buy this game just because you are curious about how bad the ending is and wait until bioware and ea release alternate endings as free downloadable contentmass effect  the original game was fantastic a real favoritemass effect   lots of changes story is side tracks didnt care much for itmass effect it starts out a disaster if youve played the previous mass effect games and youre importing a custom character
a flaw that should have been clearly obvious to bioware was overlooked and has yet to be patched kicks off the problems
once you get past that you get into the gamemass effect  feels refined
what mass effect  could have been
theres clear understanding of your weapons and stats again
you can also mod your weapons again and the abilityskill system is fleshed out to allow a little more preference
you can actually run again instead of that poor excuse of a  second sprint
theres jumping over openings climbing ladders etcgone are the annoying mini games for hacking and bypassing
no more scanning planets for untold countless hours to find resourcesthe story feels back on track and youre actually going to finish what you originally started in mass effect
lots of returning characters although most of them are there just to make a cameo appearance and add something to the story as a whole
past choices feel like they might mean something in the grand scheme of thingsthen you find yourself looking at the mission log to find that it barely exists
theres no current status of a mission no progress report
lets not even talk about the fact that every time you bring it up its near the bottom making you scroll all the way up to see what is active
you start to find that the game is very linear and although your old choices may somehow come back to bite you the end game result will pretty much be the sameso after sinking dozens of hours into it you reach the end
a two minute cutscene that is basically the same thing each time just slightly tweaked
there is little to no closure real value in everything you did especially if you played all  games entirely which adds up well over  hours
as an example it would be like ending lord of the rings with frodo throwing the ring into the fire and bam
cut to the credits or ending star wars with ackbar saying its a trap
it sets out to be something great and goes out in a fiery blaze of failures
hence i call it the hindenburg of gamesoverall until the last hour of it all i could have believed it was a good game
it was a good game until it came into the final hours and you can clearly feel the whole thing unravel and fall apart effortlessly as if they ran out of time and funds and they had to slap on the end somewhere
its so bad it ruins the whole experiencethe writing wasnt that bad and if you played the previous games there are plenty of references and jokes cracked by characters like joker and garrus
the acting though fell apart in mass effect  i often felt the voice actors werent even trying to play their roles but just reading the lines like microsoft samgeththere are some graphical glitches although nothing game breaking
one in particular i ran into a characters head was on backwards and twitching like something out of a horror moviehaving bought the collectors edition i also got the prothean dlc which is a complete joke
the extra mission itself is short enough you could make a cup of tea in the time it takes to finish and what the character adds to the game is very little
some extra dialog but nothing worth 
not even  imothis is likely the last bioware game i will purchaseright this is probably one of the most painful reviews ive ever written
i was a longtime fan of mass effect
in fact my fist rpg ever was mass effect  i had never played an rpg before that game
once i started i could not stop playing rpgs now im hooked to them all thanks to mass effect
even now  years on it still gives me goose bumps when i start a new game of mass effect  on my x and hear its compelling music scorei didnt expect much of the multiplayer but when they offered it for free prerelease i was blown away it was utterly compelling and addictive
launch day arrived and so did my collector edition copy securing a ce copy in the uk has been a major ordeal
after playing for two weeks i feel let down and am completely disappointed
here is why could not import my me character
for a series whose main premise is to carry  decisions over it is simply unacceptable that on release day you are unable to carry on with a characters that has taken you hundreds of hours
even now weeks after release there is no patch
what happened to the over  variables that would carry over to the me instalment
nothing
all your trouble for nothing
all your past decision serve no purpose all the dlc you bought to add those cool squad mates in me are gone just great guys
only because of this flaw the game deserves nothing less than a 
dayone dlc from ashes
i got it free with my ce but i find it completely unfair that such an important and relevant character for the whole series such as jarvik is cut out of the core game and bundled in a paid for dlc
every gamer and fan of the mass effect game should have free and unrestricted access to this dlc from day one
it is not the icing on the cake it is a core part of the mass effect series
same as you did with sebastian in the exiled prince dlc from da
you cut it out of the main game
hello
unbounded corporate greed you say
dlcs have to add to the core game not detract from it
terrible ending
how on earth is this possible
after  years waiting for this moment and this is what we get
reeeally
you must be joking
this major sloppy and inexcusable flaw for a game of this calibre which was dubbed the star wars of this generation is what makes the score fall to 
me was already streamlined from the first game but me is completely watered down it is not an rpg it is a shooter with some dialogue
you only have the illusion of choice
you are constantly railroaded around like in da extremely annoying and disappointing
the facts that you can now shoot with more guns and tinker them doesnt add complex rpg elements
this brings the score down to 
what happened to the epic music score from me
gone
there is no memorable set piece in this game unlike its predecessors
score falls down to bioware have you not learnt from dragon age  crass mistakes
please do not tell us you did not expect this fan backlash or polarizing reviews
you already pulled that one out of your hatme was a landmark rpg in gaming history that welldeserves a  even now five years on
me was a solid shooter that deserved an 
me does not even deserve to be branded under the mass effect name
very poor gaming terrible endingbioware pull yourself together and smell the coffee before it is too late
you must change your ways and go back to your core roots
youve lost the plot and you are steadily losing your fan base us who pay your mortgagesdrakani can not stress how big of a fan i am of the me universe and my femshep
i have put in over  hours playing me    several times
i even own a model of the normandy
having said thati will never again buy another bioware or ea game
they have completely ruined the entire series by the disgusting ending they gave us
i will not spoil the ending for those of you that have not yet played it though there are several reviews here that have already done so
the ending literally made me sick to my stomach followed by whitehot burning anger
the game is great does most things right except you literally only see any of the teammates you assembled previously for seconds in cameos
it also seems that none of your previous choices matter at all
i mean not one iota of a smidgen of a difference
wtf
you never get any closure to previous problems or storylines and your relationships that you have spent countless hours massaging into a veritable gigantic force are left with huge open questions as to what the heck happened to them
there are enough holes in the storyending to fill the entire galaxy
i am so hugely disappointed disgusted and angered at what they have done to this great series
this article expresses the exact reason for my hatred very eloquently looks like amazon doesnt like links
just go to game front and type in mass effect ending hatred
i also wanted to speak about multiplayer
it is buggy as heck
i have been disconnected from the server at least a dozen times most of the time i am in the last wave and about to be extracted or half way through the waves
one time i finished all the waves was extracted and got kicked off the server lost connection
of course i lose all of my experience and credits
i hate you eabiowareso after completing mass effect  last night i have only really have one thing to say
this game this series has moved me more than anything ive ever experience
not just in books or film or anything like that
i mean media period
the characters are believable loveable or even hateable
no matter what every single character makes you feel something
every single plot point makes you feel something even
anger sadness joy you name it
i truly fell on love with this universe over the past four years
i have become so emotionally invested that on numerous occasions i shed tears leaped in joy and shouted yes
needless to say mass effect as a whole has had a profound effect on me
every plotline resolved itself in a very satisfying way that exceeded my expectations
best part is that they can resolve in a different way depending on your choices
its one of the best scifi epics ive ever seen period
unfortunately there is something that does bog this game down
the ending
it is perhaps the most disappointing thing about the game
thats not to say its the worst ending ever
its bitter sweet tragic and there are some good ideas burred there unfortunately a rushed and sloppy execution ruin it
its not what i wanted and it almost felt like everything id invested in the series didnt really amount to anything
it did but that feeling wasnt there
take mass effect s ending perhaps one of the best finales in the history of gaming it made me feel triumphant great like i had really accomplished something
mass effect s has no such effect
i guess from an emotional standpoint it fails where it should have succeeded
it was too complex when it needed to be simple
it was bold but the payoff was not worth the buildup
but what ive spent the past day trying thinking about and the conclusion ive come to is that its not about the ending
the ending doesnt really matter to me
the journey i took with these characters in this universe is what i am going to remember fondly
mass effect is perhaps my favorite series of games ever and im glad i experienced it
if the ending falters so be it at least i still have everything else to lovewith that out of the way i feel i have to talk about something besides the story
the import system returns and works brilliantly to connect the three games together
you run into people youve previously met and just casual mentions remind you of what youd done
you really should play the first two by the way
starting at the second or third game would be a mistake despite what the marketing says
this series works so well because its all connected and missing out on any of it would cheapen the experience
the gameplay is vastly improved from mass effect  the combat is intense guns handle amazingly and none of them feel useless
you can mod them all as well
this means that chances are your weapons will be tailored to your liking no matter what
the new weight system which determines how fast your powers cool down depending on how many guns you carry coupled with the ability to carry any numberkind of guns you want helps make you feel even more in control
the powers are all improved as well
they can be upgraded in several different ways thanks to improved skill trees
this helps for strategizing and customizing your character completely
it takes the best aspects of both mass effect  and  and combines them
the ai is considerably more intelligent
they are clever resourceful and it makes for a great challenge
there are a wide variety of them as well
mainly its the reaper ground forces cerberus and the geth
all of them require a different tactic and each of them are distinct
the sound is brilliant as well the guns sound realistic the music is powerful and it really sets the tone from the story
the voice acting is top notch with every returning actor delivering their best performances
the cut scenes are very well directed as well though some occasional bugs can disrupt the immersion but its so minor that i dont even care
the graphics are good while not the best and starting to kind of show their age mass effect is still a beautiful game
textures could be better and some pop in rears its ugly head every here and there but again its forgivable
this is especially made apparent by the massive scale of the set pieces
when you see reapers descending towards vancouver at the beginning of the game you really see how big they are nay you feel how big they are
the newest and probably most innovative thing about the game is the war room galaxy readiness system
you have to search the galaxy for resources war assets and support in order to have a chance of taking earth back from the reapers
there are so many ways to do this it felt a little overwhelming
i spent hours on the citadel just doing side quests to gain support
every little bit counts in this game and it really feels that way
with that i shall segue into what is perhaps the most controversial aspect of this game the multiplayer
i am happy to report that this component is both totally optional and a lot of fun
its a  player class based coop mode that requires you to survive wave after wave of geth reapers or cerberus
after a few rounds you have an objective that gets you money that you can use to buy more weapons classes and equipment
you fight them as several classes from vanguards to infiltrators
the characters you create are your own you can customize them similar to shepard but to a smaller degree
this multiplayer helps you in the overall progress of the game but like i said its totally optional and i didnt need to play much to be completely ready to fight the reapersso mass effect  is in a word amazing
it has affected me in a more profound way than anything else due to biowares uncanny ability to get me so emotionally invested
the ending falters but you should not let it ruin the series for you
this series is perhaps the best trilogy of this gaming generation
it improves on me in every way and is a strong contender for game of the year
but above all that it moved me emotionally in a way that i didnt think was possible out of ive noticed a lot of the low star reviews for this game are very unfair
yes i agree the last  minutes of the game the last maybe  threw everyone for a loop but the other  of the game is greatanyone who has played mass effect  or  wont be disappointed and will be in for a fun ridelook by now you have read enough to form some kind of mindset about this game but i still say play it
yes they could have done the ending better then what they did but the game is still good
regardless what people wrote voted or who to blame this game is worth the time
the ending you can find in other reviews what made that person upset about the whole package you can find some where else blaming bioware and ea for whatever reasons you can find them in other reviews
me
im going to give it straight they fixed where you scan for resources on planets this is a plus the game runs smoother
less crashes then me there is a weapons upgrade
me or me didnt have this more suits of armor all free and not dlc great sound
great story
a blast to playwhat has people bent out of shape is the ending and other things i think didnt really take away from the game at all
again not the best and its by far not the worse either compared to other games on the market
hell ill go one even further to say that if you played mass effect at all you need to play this one
i dont get paid to write reveiws
but i can understand why some gamers feel the way that they do
i really did like me cause there was a story here and characters that you will care about
bottomline is dont let the bad comments or low score keep you from playing a game that really did take a chance on a story
again the end is not the best but its not the worse ending to a great storymost of the  star reviews havent even beaten the game how can you rate it if you havent beaten it
i watched the first  mins of this movie and i can say without seeing the rest that it is a  star movie worthy of an oscarseriously bioware you need to fix this
there is no point to any n missions muliplayer war assets or characters you assisted through the game that arent crew
none of that is in the ending
you get the same one no matter what
wtf
why am i working hard to get war assets then
why play any other missions than the main ones
what happens to the rest of your friends
wrex miranda samara kirahhe kasumi zaheed etc
is everyone on the citadel dead then
where did they go they didnt
so i saved the council multiple times so they can die off screen and you dont even tell me they die
so many plot holes what were you thinking
years of empty promises lies and more lies
i feel betrayed
ive been depressed for the past couple of days thinking about this is the end to all my favorite characters they all just die off screen and no i dont want you to explain it in me i wont be buying it
i want the ending to me now
not explained laterps thanks for day one dlc btw
yeah the prothean didnt add to the story at all it felt all extrasarcasmpps we wouldnt do it any other way
how could you go through all three campaigns playing as your shepard and then be forced into a bespoke ending that everyone gets
but i cant say any more than that  mike gamblelolso weve all heard about how terrible this games ending is and the score on amazon reflects this
i just started playing the game a week ago and have not gotten to the end so this review has nothing to do with the ending which i have tried really hard to avoid reading spoilers about it on the netamazing ties to the other games
you meet ashleykaiden and they actually have a good sized personal story so it is neat to think of all the content that isnt there because you went the other direction so long ago
you also get the help of wrex assuming he didnt die in the first one
he also has a pretty big part in the story so i kind of wonder who is in his place if he did die
the bug queen makes a return as well so you see your decision come back again
ive only played about  to  hours so far and i have been very impressed with the throwbacks to the previous games and im sure that there are going to be plenty morerpg wut
ok i think we can stop calling this game an rpg because it simply isnt
its a shooter with a leveling system
you no longer have an inventory to manage and once you get an item once it just unlocks so you can give that weapon to as many companions that can use it
this concept is even further enforced by the fact that when you enter a mission area you pull out your weapon and you can never put it away
it really looks like a third person shooter through and through
they even add an option so it will automatically make dialog choices for you
it is very clear that they are catering to a different audience than me was trying to capturethey also took out the resource grind
it got very boring in me going to every planet and using the scanner to find resources
i wanted to slit my wrists trying to get resources so thank god that was removed
there is still a scannerprobe system but the radar points you right to it and there is only  per planetso it looks like the few companions that i have unlocked is it
i dont really mind the fewer companions since i only ever used  anyway
i think it actually adds a lot to the character development to focus on fewer people
i have liara and garrus so i couldnt be happierkinect  meh they really hyped up the kinect usage but it is really garbage
it is much faster and reliable to use the in game menu plus it pauses the combat to issue commands
plus you feel like a complete idiot trying to say the dialog lines only to be repeated by shepard on the screen
or standing in front of a door and saying open instead of pressing a on the controller
it is really just a gimmick that adds no value to the gamecombat is fluid
the combat is very smooth and it feels like a great shooter
the enemies arent that smart so i am a little disappointed in the ai
the enemy will often move into a flanking position only to retreat and go back to fighting head on which makes no sense
i have only died a couple of times and that was due to stupidity on my partending
like i said i havent beaten the game yet but i am going to max my war assetreadiness score before i beat the game
i will edit the review with my thoughts when that happensedit so i finished the game and the ending was very climactic and was executed near flawlessly
one thing that kind of bugged me was that your final decision has  choices none of which are impacted by your prior choices
however the last decision was not an easy one
throughout the series the game was full of black and white choices obviously good and evil but that was not the case in the end
each option had its downsides and none of them would be good or evil so it was not an easy choice to make
it was a great ending to an amazing series
i really dont see what all the fuss is aboutbefore i finished the game i heard of all the articles about outraged fans complaining about the ending and i thought how bad can it be
the games great so far and im sure the die hard fans are just picky
boy was i in for a surprise
i now join the thousands of gamers here to warn the rest of you to not play this game as itll leave you feeling sour and cheatedto be completely fair the game itself is really fun the quality is top notch compared to previous versions multiplayer is great but at the same time there are plenty of high quality game in this market
others are out there trying to win the hearts of the audienceending was awesome i loved iteveryone else that cry about it is just upset they cant make a game this greatbuy it and enjoy
dont follow the sheepthis is not a bad product
i simply did not enjoy the game
what i did play with friends was fun but overall i didnt have the time to get invested in the single player that it deservesi dont like how ea manages their accounts and payments
the way they do used games and dlc frankly suckssign of the times i supposelooking at the reviews and seeing folks getting lambasted for their positive reviews it shows me how frustrated people are with the ending of this game
while i share some of the misgivings about the ending i still enjoyed the ride that was mass effect starting out i immediately noticed how much more urgent the game felt  which gave it a bit of a rushed feeling
i felt this was appropriate considering the situation with the reapers
but even in the rush the game still had time to tell its story which is the main reason i play the mass effect games
i felt there was plenty of story to tell in this installment and it seemed very wellpaced
some of the characters i wished would return had cameos only and that was pretty disappointing for methe combat as usual was solid and upgrading weapons was a nice touchtowards the end of the game i noticed my readiness was still at  and was irritated about that so went online to find out that i needed to play online to up this
initially i was furious  why should i have to play multiplayer to benefit my single player
so i begrudgingly logged into some games to find out that it is essentially just mes version of gears of wars horde mode
i was relieved no mindless chattering of halo or cod brats just people who were focused on finishing missions to up their readinessafter upping my readiness i decided it was time to hit the point of no return
i ripped through the final missions and was a little disheartened not to have a final boss style fight
when i got to the ending i was prepared for it to disappoint but didnt fully know what to expect i hid from spoilers
i chose my ending and finished the game
it was not the way i would have chose to end the series and was pretty disappointed
i am hoping we will maybe see some aftermath dlc to tie up some of the loose endsafter finishing the game i was immediately reminded of the end of steven kings dark tower series and i believe king said that its the journey not the destination
even though the ending was a little heartbreaking the journey was one heck of a ride
i have no regrets about investing so many hours into this seriesspoilerthe series was great dynamic and epic but bioware ended it on a horrible note making all the dynamic decisions of your playthroughs boil down to an inevitable suicide with your choice of  flavors
if you had a love interest you will never see himher again nor find any closure to the relationship
its basically a kobayashi maru for shepardme fans have been trolled by one of the best game publishers in existence and it saddens me to an extent
to me it is a dealbreaker as the conclusion was the main selling point of this titleedit upgrade to stars
new ending dlc addressed the endings much to my satisfaction
while still short of perfect the game is now a much better packageafter mass  this game had all the potential in the world to be one of best games of the decade and perhaps all time
unfortunately it was a total disasterwhen i was about half way through it i thought maybe there will be some hardcore mass  fans that thought the series took a fall after mass  and they may like this
i figured if you thought mass  was the pinnacle of the series you probably will not be too impressed
but after i finished it i couldnt in good conscience recommend this game to any mass effect fan especially the the ones who played the first  alot
to me this was the worse ending ive ever seen in my gamer history which goes back to the n days
mass  is one of my top three all time favorite games and the ending was so bad that i will not even be able to play mass  for atleast a year cause this game and its ending kinda ruined the series for mebeyond the ending it has many other issuesmaybe some spoilerscharacters all your cool ass squad mates from mass  are gone except for tali who still doesnt arrive till later in the game like in  you cant recruit any of them no jackgruntlegionzaheed none
you can get all of them to make an appearanceexcept kelly i think although some of the side missions there associated w are time sensitive so you can miss out
some make longer appearances than others but who cares i want all them on my crew to choose from idk if theres  squad mates
stop wasting money on mutilplayer and do your job and make a really awesome single player rpg
if i want to play mutiplayer ill play gears  the same way i dont expect a rpg from gow i dont want nor expect a mutiplayer from mass effect
the story half of the charters have for not coming w you is even more stupid
and who replaces all those cool characters james vega
 who reminds me of the typical juicehead u see at a local pizzeria or car wash working just to get more steroids
then liara whos alright i mean i usually hook up w her
but i find her more interesting by associationshadow broker her mother more that by personality
garrus is another one whos alright but i dont find him all that interesting on missons or to talk to
and last a new character who is pretty cool but i think its added just to shut legion fans up and not get mass amounts of angry emails
ash is around for  mission and then i think she will come back to your squad if u slept w hercombat its like they tried to go gears of war but failed badly
the combat system is clunky and has no fluidity
and im not saying that mass  had the greatest combat out there but it worked and worked well for mass and would of worked better than the half finished system that they put in  the weapon and upgrade system is like a combo of  but they took the good parts out of both and left them out and your left w a crappier system than both the previous games
grenades replace your heavy weapon in this one ahh no
give me back my arc projector thanksspoiler alertstoryline well it has more holes than a block of swiss cheese
and i dont know if some of this is glitches or just sheer poor game design but some of the major decisions get contradicted throughout the game like at  point they have the whole baby human reaper i killed in  and they are running the their base off its heart
yet i destroyed the collector base w the baby reaper inside wtf
bioware was going for tears and shock in  but it had all the tears and shock of a cheap d rated horror film
the story drags more than few times throughout the game
some parts are predictable but thats kinda expected at least a little w a final of a trilogy
there is a few mass effect type moments but there just to few to make up for the train wreck that is mass effect  and if the ending doesnt make the top  worse endings of this decade ill be shocked should be graphics a slight upgrade over  but quite satisfactory
i mean are they as nice as some other games from the past year no but there fineoverall i wish i never played this to begin with the game without the ending was a half ass effort and not worth my time
but that ending i wish i never saw i would rather bioware come out and say there were leaving the series at mass  because they couldnt come up with a game that would meet the high mass effect standards
instead they lowered that standard to the lowest common denominator with this gamespoiler alertupdate one thing i wanted to add was that i see a lot of people saying your decisions in mass  mean nothing at the end of mass  and while thats true
and i fully understand that the end of mass  kind of overshadows many of the games other faults
the thing is  of the decisions you made in the first  mean nothing in the entire rd game
saving wrex and kirrahe from mass  doesnt matter their back in  whether they died or not
destroyed the collector base
well its back
destroyed or saved malins curesame outcome
saved or killed arachne queenshes back either way
doesnt matter who u romanced sometimes it even picks a different girl than the one u picked
and me and my friend sold our copies of mass  already i can only imagine what else we would of seen had we imported all of the different saves we had ready from mass and even after further thought and discussion on this game i still stick with my  star review bad and boring conversations horrible combat and battles mostly bad storyline lack of interesting charters very little choice and exploratory value and the endingwell you already know
so whats really left after thatnothing its just a shell of the  titans that came before ithighly recommend this game for rpg lovers and scifi fans
while the ending may be divisive no other gaming franchise allows for you to have so much control over how the games progresses between and within each game
very rewardingthe dialogue for this game seems right out of an armed forces recruiting video
its all about the war and the side effects of the war and cheesy romance options that make me cringe and focuses very little about the scifi aspects that i was hoping for aside from some techno babble and scenerythe plot is basically just a direct extension to mass effect  with no apparent creativity with adding new elementsthe controls on xbox  is also a bit clumsy given how it uses the a button to sprint without an option as far as i could find to bind it to something else
in order to run and turn at the same time you have to do contortionist work with your index finger to steer look and sprint at the same timethe gameplay is also pretty much exactly mass effect   it feels like i already played and beat this gameill be selling it used on amazon or doing the video games tradein thing on amazon before i even finish playing through it and while the price is still highi honestly feel like this is one of the best rpgs that i have ever played
i have read and heard some people refer to this game as having a sopranos ending lol
well that ending really did suck and was so atypical of the whole series
well the way i see it is this is a video game that people are getting way too emotional aboutthe whole idea is that rpgs are fair game when it comes to the endings they can be really awesome or really lackluster
this game is like watching a really good epic scifi flick
tis game will have your undevided attention from start to finish
i became a fan later on in the series after playing some of me
i was a bit confused at first but i fit in well with the game and i began to understand most of the story
so i played the game over a  week period and i just finished it this evening  hours
i am very pleased and i feel like i got my monies worth and i am actually playing it a second time to get the rest of the achievementslol
well if i can help anyone who has not played any of the me games or at least me i must say overall you will be intrigued and mostly satisfied
i know most of the reviews are rather negativedisappointing but you will only truly know if you play it for yourselfkudos to biowarei already had this third mass effect me when i was still playing the second me
i finished me and the next day me began
immediately i can tell you that the graphics are way better
the subject is more serious earth burns from minute  and the characters villains their techs and mecs are more sturdy
i fi nished the me in three weeks time enjoyed every minute of itexcept  the endingdifferences no matter what gun you choose the general odds are the same coz the way theyre put its either more damage but slow firing or less damage but rapit firingso if youre accurate the odds of kiling an enemy is the same the way the story evolves theres little chance there will be a mass effect  im sad here
my year old son followed the storylines from day  and would run over to watch the movies between battles
after watching the closing movie to me his face was all red eyes swollen with tears 
even my  year old brother went to tears and he only knew the story of me
im just hoping electronic arts find a way to keep the mass effect series alive and going
im giving this review  stars ecasue of the ride  how it endedgenerally saying i loved the me also
no disappointments in purchasing it
its a wild ride star wars meets star trek story lots of fun and a lot of choices to actually choose from based on which the whole story changes
i loved it
wish it opened choices for a better endingbut it feels like no matter how good i play the stage is set for tears if youve done better let me know please
i played it twice with the second time i got more allies around  glactic readiness was still  and i hope someone tells me how to improve this
ashley also dies both times
i donno but i hoped i could have a choice in these too
rumor has it ea is devising a new ending at least to change our shocked emotions into a more subtle ending
im sure that will helpedall the  start reviews are idiotic the game itself in incredible until the last  minutes where spoilersyou meet a magical god child and everything you did before doesnt mean a damn thingtoo bad a little more effort would have made the game perfectstill an amazing game so attached to the characters mordins death is epicas a diehard fan of mass effect i was blown away bioware did an excellent with the game mechanics gameplay was polished as should be on the begining of the series me was good game but the bugs on this game was like a plague to it seem like it was transfered from the pc version to be able to played on xbox on me found couple of annoying glitches like the one on the citadel on the shooting range the was a side quest on csec where i spoke to guy and he didnt appear looked like i was talking alone these minor flaws wasnt a big deal but how bioware sttabbed us in the back like that
why 
jesus i feel so dissapointed that i believe they did this on porpuse they dont have idea how many fans do they have
stabbing us on the back like that
what this ending is suppossed to mean
i am so dissapointed how could you ruin such a nice game dont tell me you ran out of scripts just right there i strongly believe that this was done on porpuse extended cut didnt fix nothing just wait for to be  used if you wanna see what was like bioware we should call you beaware do something to fix this this extended cut doesnt fix anything
yes i cried for this betrayalwow
i really cant believe how many people were so angered by the ending of this game
i really dont think its fair to judge the full game just on the ending
yes i do agree that things were summed up a bit too quickly but am i going to waste time and energy worrying about the ending to a freakin video game
no
no im notthe journey to the end of the game is what i played the game for and it largely did not disappoint
i got to see my actions from me play out and that is what i played the game for
it answered my questions that i had throughout the entire series and that left me pretty satisfiedsome things during my play time did end up affecting my overall rating of the game however
there are quite a few glitches in this game
not so much during the actual action parts but during conversations and cut scenes
characters disappearing from view midconversation sometimes awkward animation hitches etc
i was pretty frustrated so many of those things made it into the final game
there were a few times that the coversystem made me get caught in the geometry of the game world as well forcing me to load my last game
this happened only twice however and i have not heard this complaint oftenother than those glitches and bugs this is the best looking mass effect yet
the battles against the reapers especially look amazing and are intense
there are also more weapons and you can now upgrade them with better accuracy power ammo capacity etc
this allows much more customizationother than these changes and probably a few more there isnt a whole lot different from me
this may be good or bad depending on what you liked or didnt like about me
thankfully you wont be searching every planet for elements
it is now used to search for resources to aid in the war effort
only a few planets in each galaxy contain them so you wont have to be constantly shooting off beacons left and right
its a lot less time consuming this time aroundagain the game is very fun to play and is very worth playing if you have followed the series
the journey to the end was worth the price for me
i didnt really even mind the ending
it just wrapped things up too quickly
i wish there would have been a lengthy ending sequence to explain how everything went downand just a bit of advice
if you can play the multiplayer
this will raise your combat readiness in the main game which in turn will give you the best ending in the game if its high enough
youll know what im talking about when you startive enjoyed all the me game and this one was no exception
do i have problems with the ending
yep
did they fix them with the new ending
somewhat
but no other game has ever had such an emotional impact and im not going to knock off a star for the last  mins of a gamethis is a beautiful game and is a great ending to the trilogy
the game play is vastly improved over the last two iterations of the title
i played in my own style
somy experience will be different from others that play differentlyprosyou get all of the armor that came with different editions of me
the collector and terminus armors were my favorite to play withits easier to get coverthe weapons are upgradable with modifications
you can also use any type of weapon class that you want
youre not limited by your character classthe story is very deep
i made some choices that are still bothering me
spoiler alert i decided to exterminate the geth
i was rooting for them in me but due to my game play style i could only choose between the geth or the quarians
i decided organic life was more important in the fight against the reapersconsthe quality control on the camera angles and some of the rendering was awful for this caliber of blockbuster video game
i know this seems like a petty thing but its so prominent and pervasive that it interrupted fluid and consistent gameplay
this cost the game a star rating from methe decisions that you made in the previous titles are addressed in a mostly superficial way with the exception of character deaths in memiscconcerning all of the heart burn regarding the ending of the game
i can agree to a certain extent
but if you want to be told a story where everything is tide up neatly you can watch any of the garbage thats coming out of hollywood
bioware did a relatively good job of ending the trilogy while leaving things open for the next mass effect seriesoverall this game is worth every single penny
i cant wait till they release a new title
hopefully in two years or soi played all three games in sequence and my review reflects that experienceyou will read stellar reviews of me and me  those built on each other to provide a rich experience where every single decision and every conversation led to moral choices which impacted the outcome of the plot later on
me was perfects the pinnacle of that choose your own adventure system where the survival of your band of heros in the final mission depended on how you interacted with themsuch were the expectations for me
did we get any new squad members
well not really
james vega is there for comedy relief but doesnt really do anything ashkaidangarrus doesnt already do
and like me the specific requirement on each mission for a tech specialist so you can hack containers for loot isnt needed anymore so it doesnt really matter who you bring along save the unique dialog the team members sometimes bring
still the missions remain enveloping and fun just like me
there are moral consequences at the end of each mission which seemingly impact the final mission being the gathering of allied support
the story is much more sweeping and on a galactic scale compared to the first two games which is fine if youve played the first two but for newbies it lacks the personal touch of gathering squad members and learning more about each one themso gameplay is the same
thats a good thingthere are fewer areas to explore now
i think only the citadel has free roam in this game
part of what makes me fun is the noncombat sections where you roam around and learn about things
that is lacking in me but did not really serve as a huge detractor for mewhich leaves us with the ending
everyone knows it is pretty terrible and even if the developers pulled a fast one by indoctrinating the audience that is a totally lame nihilistic ending that fails to reward fans for having invested in part  and part that said i think folks should still play all three games
the journey is very satisfying and when was the last time you thought about the ending to a game
i certainly have not
but i did remember all the crazy things that happened leading up to it and how much fun i had building the team up along the way
and that is the inherent value in rpgs  you build up a teamcharacter from a nothing level  to something you feel proud of
naturally me would be a  if the ending reflected that investment in character but up until the final ridiculous scene you never felt let downoverall 
but the entire series is a  and is a must playthe only thing that sucks is that you arnt given as many choices as you were in me when you interact with people
and at that the choices are obvious bad guy or good guy choices
no real hard choicesi loooove the single story of these games
i bought this when it launched and still play the multiplayer all the time
also  for all the people that are all upset about the ending they just fixed it to suit it closer to the rpg players needsi waited a long time before finally breaking down and buying this game
i heard so many bad things from other gamers about it
i just didnt want to risk it
having exhausted all my other favorite games i finally got this one
i have to say that its one of the best games ive ever played
it really ties up everything from the other two games
the graphics are good on par with or slightly better than me
i really loved the missions though and the story of the continuation of the friendships and bonds forged from the previous games
yes the ending was sad dont think thats a spoiler at this late date but it was how it had to end
there could be no easy way out for shepherd after fighting this battle for so long
it wouldnt have felt honest if the reapers were defeated so easily and shepherd got to walk off into the sunset
i hate to see it end but it was a great game series
me me and me will be keepers that im sure ill play again and again just because there are so many different possibilities that pop up depending on the choices that you makemass effect  was better than   the truth is i didnt like the ending  they didnt have all the crew on the ship
over allthey could have done the ending better
miranda was not with the crew on ship
didnt make sense why they did this so i think it could have been better in the long runthe developers  bioware said that they delayed the release of me to ensure that it met everyones expectations
well sorry to say it did not and not just for the ending which was a huge disappointment
i will try and itemize the issues i personally had with the game
some of the missions were entirely too short particularly the side missions and in some ways they took the easy way out
for example you overhear someone speaking about a missing prothean artifact so you set out to find it anticipating a firefight to recover this ancient relicwrongyou just have to scan a planet and bingo
you found the artifacttotally lame
past characters that are gratuitously introduced thanemirandajacobsamaragruntjack
i would have liked the opportunity to have these characters in your squad for at least one mission but thats just me
there was no consequence to the actions from past decisions
if you romanced miranda in me and lets face it  who didnt
  youd think that there would be more to the relationship in me rather than essentially its good to see you the missions are disappointingly repetetive
brief in the war room brief on the shuttle explore and kill baddies defend a stronghold kill more baddies choose a path and the end of the shooting renegadeparagon back to the normady debrief from hackettrinse and repeat
scanning and reaper alertness this just became annoying hitting your scanner twice and then having to flee a sector and not being able to returnwas very poorly implemented and simply became irritatingspoilers below
the ending where most of the controversy lies
i too was not happy with the way bioware chose to end the game
and when you look at the ending some things stand outa
the relays were destroyed so the krogan turians asari geth etcare all stranded on earth and cant get home after the big fightb
the ending left you feeling hollow like the scope of what had transpired was minimalizedc
it would have been nice to see more of a final fantasy type ending where all  the characters were shown either together or seperately rejoicing and celebrating their victory they just saved the galaxy afterall
all i can think of with the ending is that perhaps bioware ended things as they did in order to set the stage for a new franchise set in the same me world but as a completely independent entityi dont knowall i know is that while the game was entertaining at times it was hardly the showstopping epic that the trailers and developers promised it would bei felt betrayed by bioware for the horrid ending and the high cost of the collectors edition
i paid   for the collectors edition from gamestop and it was a ripoff
the items both in game and with the game box i received from the collectors edition are a joke two books and a stupid patch
the items i received from mass effect  ce were more useful and fun in gameto get the best war readiness rating i must play multiplayerscrew thatthe main reason i felt betrayed was the horrible ending
i understand that in war st happens but when it came to the ending it was a slap in the face
all that hard work helping the races to work together only to have them either destroyed or living in the equivalent of the dark ages
wow what a pyrrhic victoryonly two options were given all with the very same ending yet with different cosmetic effects
each main major character that died in helping sheridan was heart wrenching but hey that is war
when anderson died spoiler alert it was sad but he completed the mission hence he died fulfilled
the choices given were not much of a choice either way you are dead and everyone is dead or suffers but hey the reapers are gone whoopeemore work should have been put into the so called ending
for example another ending could be that mass relays were destroyed along with the reapers but the races rebuild them which takes time
during that time the races that are scattered on each others planet and learn the hard way to work together while the mass relays are being rebuilt
yes i know this looks lame but better than the wtf ending from bioware
great let down guysdamn the chief from the last halo game made it to a cryogenic podwell just to add my voice to the throngs of disappointed fansthe game is great right up till the end ruins it
new endings were released as a free dlc or update and these fix some of the problems but not enough and so the damage is done
ive lost a great deal of interest in the mass effect series as a resultthe gameplay was funmp is actually greatthe story was good until the poor endingthose playing this for the first time with the new endings may like it moredefinitely a game you have to play to get better at
worth the time
my favorite is the destroyer with particle rifle ampd up with incendiary roundsmass effect  is the final story arc for commander shepherd
it blends the best of both games together such as having a more worldwide story like the first game along with the many powers
it has the combat from the second game and also the mineral scanner
the game sounds amazing until you realize it has  big flaws
the number  flaw is the endings
it leaves you with more questions where this is suppose to be final and it feels rushedthe second big issue is your journal
the journal is a mess and though it shows your main mission clearly enough it also mixes your side quest with them
the problem with it is that the journal doesnt tell you when you have the right items for a side quest or the fact that some of these are timed
this can be frustrating when you are trying to get the best ending
the final flaw is that your heavy weapons from mass effect  are gone for the most part
you will occasionally pick up a heavy weapon only for it to have  or  shots unlike mass effect  where you could pick a heavy weapon whenever you wanted
overall the game was worth the  dollars i paid and is well worth it just forget about the endingim not here to rip on me just for the sake of doing so or because its whats cool to do on the internet like so many othersbasically me is the worst of the series in every way possible compared to the other  games because it doesnt build or improve anything
it simply just tries to hurriedly finish the series for the sake of a cash in on the title there is no sense of exploration
the game as efficiently as possible holds your hand every step the way and has you actually being on the ground doing things the least amount possible
side missions are carried out by quickly scanning a planet ala me and then firing a probe
thats it
you dont explore you dont get to check out uncharted worlds simply for the sake of curiosity or anything
scan shoot probe side mission done all without even leaving the galaxy map
this tactic accounts for the majority of side missions
me you could explore the galaxy drive around in that horribly handling buggy and had a sense of discovering things me you could land on planets and explore doing side missions with some not even firing a single shot like the crashed cruiser balanced on the mountain peak but all of those things are gone in  the game just holds your hand and ushers you from mission to mission you dont get to actually chose anything everything is pre determined for you
even if you chose the renegade or paragon path you get the exact same result and no one treats you differently and you get no alternative paths depending on your karma scale which makes it all incredibly pointless and just window dressing for the fact the story is entirely linear and so is your character the characters are all the same ones only less compelling
there are a couple new characters but they are highly disposable and not even worth messing with
james for instance is basically just a guy who talks  of the time like a generic white guy  of the time he throws out some mexican phrases like saying loco a lot in his generic white guy trying to impersonate a mexican guy and he looks like he was taken from the show jersey shore
when a old character returns you can see it coming a mile away
for instance you go into a area where the mission briefing talks about geth then you can see  minutes before which old character is going to come back
all the characters themselves seem hollow and rushed they lack the personality that made them endearing in the other games and most are there only long enough to be overly obvious in a very specific mission or they simply show up for  minutes of camera time practically winking at the player with a nod and then are gone the story compared to the others sucks
the other games had side stories character stories side missions with their own short stories and so on
me on the other is basically this everything is going to be destroyed
thats pretty much it because no matter where you go or what you do its always about the war specifically and nothing else
i also got sick of hearing phrases like were here to save lives were doing this to save lives this weapon will save lives we need to stick together to save lives billions of lives are on the line and were here to save them etc and after about  hours i was sick of hearing about the war and saving lives the game play was basically just one big shooting gallery and hiding behind chest high walls
every single fight is basically you hiding behind chest high walls to peak out and fire a few rounds only to hide back behind said wall
it was incredibly boring and has been done to death in dozens of other games
the combat was mindless and mediocre
it felt like they put absolutely no effort into the combat at all and rushed you through it in order to get to the next scene of hearing sheppard say saving lives the ending was atrocious
this is a series that prides itself on story characters and dialogue
we all spent over  bucks playing all  games and spent over  hours playing all  games but bioware seemed to say this is the end of the trilogy so who cares about the ending
the ending is the most important part of any story of any kind because its the very last thing you leave the person with and its supposed to be a reward the climax to everything leading up till then basically the ending is the most important part of any story
but the ending of me was over in just a minute or so despite the dozens of hours of dialogue cut scenes and story in the rest of the series they got lazy at the end
it gives no satisfaction at all
i can honestly say it is the laziest segment of the series
i did like though they had the balls to do what they did with sheppard but the ending still sucks and doesnt make you glad to have finished the seriesall in all if you played the other  games then youll obviously want to play this but i wouldnt bother with it until it hits  bucksand stay away from the collectors edition i was stupid enough to buy it and i felt like i wasted my moneytheyve provided an expanded ending as free dlc but aside from the controversial conclusion i felt that me is fun and continues the same style of gameplay as me and me
me required an excessive amount of micromanagement in almost every aspect
some people enjoy that kind of detail i dont find it very fun in the long run but me had a decent soundtrack
me simplified much of the processes and many people complained
me took that simplification a bit further with limited areas of exploration in the citadel and many miniquests that require using different computer terminals which werent explained very well
anything and everything that is important shows up on your hud as you walk close to it so it eliminates the pointless clickingsearching in many other rpgaction games like oblivionthe thirdperson shooting interface is about the same as me
after about  years between playing me and me it took me about  minutes to get accustomed to me
the kinect sensor worked perfectly for me even with my jersey accent
i found myself using grenade quite often because i mapped the two rb and lb buttons for biotic powers i also use voice commands for switching weapons from time to timethe femshep voice acting is still the best and i imported my character from me xbox 
unfortunately i wasnt able to import my me character into me because i bought me for the pc about  years agothe weapons bench and armor locker are still there and i always find enjoyment in tweaking the weapons loadouts and their individual mods  slots per weapon type
carrying too many weapons slows down shepards power recharging but i find the sniper rifle and shotgun to be cumbersome and slow with limited capacity anyhow
i find the assault rifle and submachinegun to be my go to weapons for the soldier and sentinel the soldier that has biotic powers and can use all weaponsoverall  stars great voice acting riveting story line especially if youve played the first  games great sound effects visuals are topnotch and i just loved the costumesweaponstechgeargot this game day it came out an the only thing i didnt like was that the multiplayer could change the way the single player ended if the galatic readiness wasnt highalot of ppl didnt like the ending i thought it was so so but they changed that with a free dlcoverall the mass effect series is one of the best single player games i ever played if you have not played it u shouldif you played me  then beware me  is similar in graphics but fluffed up a bit
the story sucks when you consider the decisions i made while in me i sided with the elusive mani concurred with his philosophy and i chose to preserve the collector basebut we begin the game as a defector to the alliance
what
that already turned me off to start
i dont like battling what i sided withme  made it end like i could make the monumental choice to be cerberus or alliance brat
misalignment in this department
i invested the time and thoughtwhy double back on me yothe synthetic plot felt hurried and rushed if not forced at times
i destroyed the geth with glee while on rannoch
wrex doesnt fight with me as a companion
really
i waited through the second game and this one to reunite with my old buddy and garrus to shoot the same old dirt up again like we did sarenbut nohe had responsibilitiesplease he is korganthe end of the story is too short abrupt unfulfilling despite the later addon on xbox live
you can read endlessly how many gamers detested the ending nuff saidwhat i like was garrushe makes a fine sniper and companioni love the dialog choicesi see things his way a lot
the liara became a stephen hawking very quick in my opinioni know she was a scientist but please to this degree
she is a wet rag in my opinion
i wanted lawson on my ship again or at least the choice to recruit her and the me     others that would be awesome limited space on your ship so pick your staff from the two previous game some might be dead so omitted or entirely new characters in me 
the jacob plot was written and executed wellwhoever did it writers and graphic artists and the manager deserved their pay on that one
joker was actually funny on me i was waiting to see really why he was called jokercheershey i just wanted to let ea and bioware know that i will not play this game
after hearing all the crappy reviews and disappointment of the ending you will not get my money
why play a game if there arent multiple endings and everything you do is for nothing
its like training  hard long years for the olympics and then deciding youre not gonna even go to the olympicswhat the heck were you people thinking
you may be satisfied with what project you put on the table but many fans are not happy
you should give the power of the players to decide the fate of the universe
if someone wants to see a crappy ending they will work towards that crappy ending
if a players want to work towards a better ending they will work towards that
you better make a mass effect  where time travel is possble and fix thishow bad does an ending have to be in order to ruin an entire series
yeah its that bad
let me clarify a few things free of spoilers
first ill actually review the game rather than tell you ho bad the ending is and leave
dont worry i have more to say than it was good up untilprosthere is still plenty of dialogue and character development
all the characters are interesting and usually say things youll want to listen to
while me tries to appeal to a mainstream audience with mp and the combat this remains one of those games that you shut the door and pay attention to the deep story and characters
the characters can be found all over the ship for dialogue choices
you dont have to always go to their specific location in order to speak with them
they can also be found on the citadel whenever you dock so sometimes youll be caught in situations rather than dialog sequences
some characters will make you think more to yourself than the series ever has before
this really is some of the best writing to date no matter how heartbreakingly awful the series endeddeathsoutcomes are generally done very well
depending on your choices andor renegadeparagon score some past characters can live or die
most of mine died but they were all masterfully killed off and one even brought me to tears
thats saying somethingthe dlc character is a wonderful addition to the series
i cant complain about having to buy him because he came with my collectors edition but i cannot imagine not having him in the game
hes no mordin or thane but he reveals the truth about the revered protheans as well as some very surprising things about the council races that im sure you would not have otherwise known without the dlc
in other words the dlc is essential
as much as i like zaeed and kasumi this dlc trumps them both
consthe combatcover system doesnt come close to the likes of uncharted
the cover system will drive you crazy and youll definitely roll when you wanted to snap to cover
a play through of this on insanity is going to result in a broken controller for sure
shooting gets quite repetitive i like shooters and it make you wish some real space age blasters beams or lasers would be part of your arsenal rather than normal guns in futuristic clothingthere is only one hub world
me had illium the citadel tuchanka and omega
you even had the shadow broker ship
besides the normandy you are limited to only the citadel to visit
that sucksyou must procure heavy weapons on site
gone are the days where you can simply equip the cain arc projector flamehrower etc
you have to find them on the ground within a level in order to use themin mass effect  everyone eagerly anticipated how earth would be
it was hyped up in the trailers and i even remember interviews saying you could go to japan somewhere in the us and vancouver
forget all that
you only go to london
a wartorn destroyed london that is only recognizable as a human settlement because there are actual streets with road paint rather than futuristic platforms or dirt
to say that earth was underwhelming is an understatement
it downright sucked
the fights the location the atmosphere everything about it was poorly executed and made for a terrible final showdown
the awful spoilerfreeas mentioned the ending completely ruined the entire series for me
i literally just switched my desktop background from commander shepard back to big boss kojima can get an ending right
not only is it bad because it failed to satisfy me and bring closure to any of the characters we all know and love but it rendered anything i did in the past games worthless
had a romance with someone not on the ship
who cares
stopped garrus from killing sidonis
who cares
sidonis is not even in the game
saved the rachni queen
it was just a number on your galactic readinessi was looking forward to closing the book on my favorite franchise in gaming historyjust like you were
to find out that my choices meant nothing in a series that boasts its element of choice above anything else is heartbreaking
half a decade of the best game ive ever played ruined by the last  mins
they had to stumble from perfection somewhere but they fumbled at the one yard line in the super bowlmetal gear solid takes back its title as the best story driven franchise
bioware you failed big time
updatetwo words indoctrination theorycasey hudson was quoted as saying he wanted and ending that we all would talk about
i am still conflicted whether the ending was lazy and a massive disappointment or if the entire final game in the trilogy was riddled with subtleties missed by all of us who hated hated hated the ending
do yourself a favor and watch the indoctrination video
it contains truly compelling evidence that this is not the endi have changed my score for the time being because of the extremely convincing arguments throughout the vid
updateafter playing through again on insanity this game is much much easier than mass effect s insanity
it has also been announced a few weeks ago that well be getting a true ending this summer as dlc
im hoping its worthwhile but im not holding my breath
i have a few other complaints after the game after being somewhat of an expert on it now i got my galactic readiness to  and my assets to over it seems like bioware refused to think outside of the box
before infiltrating the geth ship you are walking on a blown up ship with magnetic shoes
you are basically out in open space and its awesome
these types of moments are what i was hoping for throughout the game
i wanted bioware to take advantage of the fact that were in space
throw in some zero gravity sections or maybe even be joker for a mission piloting the normandy
the possibilities are endless and while i still love the game i would have like to do more than shootingand speaking of the shooting there is too much of an emphasis on it
i know people who get through the whole game without using their powers
in me it wasnt quite a full out shooter and choosing the right squadmates made a huge difference in your play style at least on the harder difficulties
this time it reallydoesnt matter who you choose except for tali with the geth missions it matters then
you can usually just mow everyone down with bullets ignoring powerswith everything said i dont think its as good as me
the dialogue and characterization are excellent as always but it ends on a very low note
extended cut updateprior to downloading the extended cut i tried my best to beat the game and load the ending in time for tuesday the th and noticed something
the shooting is extremely dull and repetitive
me is a mediocre shooter plain and simple
ending aside i must say that the new gameplay mechanics and the extreme emphasis on shooting bores me
this resulted in me looking up the extended cut on youtube rather than shoot my way through me
maybe i should change classes or something
anyways lets get this over withthe indoctrination theory was a clever attempt at rationalizing the ending and is now proved invalid
the endings are not changed or expanded on as much as they are explained
we now have more closure and can see what bioware was trying to get across
across the internet you may find articles saying that the ending should not be tampered with as it goes against the studios artisic vision blah blah blah
well it wasnt
its what it should have been in the first place
the ending is now complete rather than extendeddo i think the indoctrination theory is better that what bioware tacked on to the end of the trilogy
yes far better in fact
is mass effect  the stinker of the trilogy that could have used a couple more years in development
definitely
the story character interactions and everything were excellent but the past crew were tacked on in missions jacob jack samara and i still dont feel like my war assets affect anything at all
as for the rachni they may as well have never been in the series
their buildup resulted in absolutely nothing
as you are reading this you probably can see that i think the series deserved a better sendoff
where were the space battles qtes interactionsconversations with the reapers sidonis garrus foe and choices from the past such as if i sided with the illusive man
i cant think of a single way that me built upon or improved on meregarding the extended cut bioware did a wonderful job patching up the misunderstood vague ending
they listened to the fans and did something about it for free
i will always appreciate that and feel comfort in the fact that this is not the end for mass effectif bioware decided to build on mes indoctrination theory i could see another game with shepard fighting the reapers under impossible odds and finding a way to win with everyone he had in his crew
except thane and legion of course
abandoned worlds devoid of life and shepard and crew must fight their way through guerilla style as to avoid being caught
all characters evolve further and are pushed to their mental limits because they are the last in the universe
then the might and wisdom of the rachni come to the rescue because of my choice back in  woohoo
 wishful thinking at this point but whatever me was okspoilers alertthis game is an immersive experience throughout
the only sensible explanation that has been brought up is that the ending scene is shepards viewpoint of being indoctrinated by the reapers which does tie in the entire storyline brilliantly
but it just ends there without explaining what happens to shepard the crew the relationships the universe etceven the mass relays are gone
what an uncertain and depressing end to a spectacular series
the countless hours spent on all three games seemed to be a waste
we expected all our previous paths to mean something but all were left with is this one bleak ending or three future dlc with additional endingsand im giving it one
i delayed purchase of the game after all these horrible reviews picking it up later on sale
where i paid full price for the first twoi get itthe ending doesnt satisfy everyone
there are plot holes the deus ex machina thing at the end the fact that the outcome is always the same
i might have expected a little more from bioware given the execution up to this pointbut one star
the sheer number of one star reviews plus the blind down voting of positive reviews and corresponding blind up voting of negative reviews makes it obvious this is more of a campaign than honest individual reviewstied to social media campaigns to take back mass effect 
i generally get what mass effect is about but definitely wouldnt consider myself a mass effect expert so i didnt get so worked about problems with the ending
yeah it was kind of stupid
and kind of short
and left gaping plot holesbesides that though this is the best mass effect yet and perhaps the best rpg on the  to date
the gameplay rivals that of gears of warand thats saying a lot about the quality
gears is the benchmark for rd person shooters and i couldnt help but be impressed at how close me is to that
the graphics are better
the cinematics are better
the environment is better
the mapsmenusrpg stuff is better
everything is as good or better than it ever has been in meif the ending keeps you from enjoying a finely crafted game for  hours then by all means  dont buy this gameor if you really really really hate ea
which i do
but i guess i like battlefield and mass effect more than i hate ea
the prothean dlc is unacceptableah the trilogy
a juggernaut of money making potential a cesspool of rabid fan disappointment and above all else absolute proof that you will never ever please everyoneas of the writing of this mass effect  has a user rating of less than  stars which blows my little mind
thisll be a long review more of a reaction than a review really because theres so much to talk about hate and anger and hate and indoctrination theories and more hate and what have you
so feel free to skip around but know this from right now  mass effect  is a brilliant game
strong fun emotional it builds on the gameplay and story elements of the previous two makes a host of improvements and adds massive replay value to each game in the series
i cant imagine not recommending it to anyone whos enjoyed the previous gameseven if it does have a stupid endingso therethe gameplay ducking and rolling and omniblades  oh my
it feels sort of odd to jump into a gameplay discussion like it aint no thing but it really aint no big thing or thang whatever
if youve played the second mass effect and seriously whos played the third and only the third in this series
that would be weird then youre already familiar with how things are going to go down
its rd person over the shoulder and cover based gun combat with some light melee sprinkled in
youve got a series of skills to use mostly science magic to help you and your squad of two others survive waves of ugly ugly space monsters
its an engrossing experience smoothed out a touch from the its predecessor but is still a little rough around the edges
shepard doesnt always stick to cover reliably your squadmates are forever in your way  its not as polished a shooter as say gears of war but its still a really satisfying compelling rich enough experience
there have been some specific improvements since the last chapter  shepard can roll and dodge and has a much more aggressive melee attack
grenades are back kaboom
and squadmates are much more responsive to your orders
again its not mind blowing but its good its compelling and fun and doesnt get dullweve got some new enemies to face and then shoot in the face  most of which can best be described as space monsters
this is probably my first point of disapproval but also the lightest so who cares
but i was a little disappointed with this most of mass effect deals with pretty clear and mostly believable enemies mercenaries pirates robots robots robots
anything that comes across as monstrous like the rachni or the reapers themselves usually comes equipped with some kind of in depth exploration to explain what they are and where they come from
but all of a sudden we have the of reaper forces a slew of footsoldier type monsters that the reapers created to i dont know kill people better than the giant space lasers they have
maybe harvest bodies and such
i guess thats probably it though you never see any of that in action
the monster designs are neat and artfully pull elements from the species that the reapers have been collecting but it also starts to push things further from the science fiction realm and deeper into the fantasy realm
the reaper forces have odd shapes glowing eyes and are starting to look more and more like generic monsters or orcs or something
in fact theyre almost exactly like the darkspawn from dragon age origins
theyre even created in a similar fashion
its one of those little additions that start to stretch and blur the borders of the mass effect universe
it works well enough and maybe its just a personal preference but stilloh also there are some ninjas
with swords and everything
i have this theory that if youre introducing ninjas into a world where they havent already been established then youre officially running out of ideas
i guess ill make this exhibit a for that theory
send me a message if you want to discuss the absurdity and absolute impracticality of bringing a sword to a gun fightbut thats it really as far as gameplay goes
new skills new enemies same flavored sauce on top
there are no vehicle type levels no big risks taken with new gameplay mechanics and only a couple of truly cinematictype fights its moslty just straight up mass effect awesomeness
its tried and true and wholly enjoyable but doesnt break new ground or even try to they took what worked and ran with itthe design  a new same new normandythis is probably the aspect of the third installment that im happiest about
you could say delighted titillated ecstatic even
the overall artistic design of the game has improved grown richer deeper and so so much prettier without losing its integrity
with the exception of the space monsters and occasional ninja and those are only light divergences it still feels like mass effect
it sounds like nothing but maintaining the tone of something especially a video game with all its variables is really difficult and being able to do so is the hallmark of real a talentthe locations especially the cityscapes are gorgeously detailed and the visuals seem to go on for miles
reapers as tall as scycrapers do their death marches in the distance as you fight your way through incredibly detailed piles of rubble hiding amongst disused vehicles and slabs of concrete
long gone are the generic levels of the first game long gone are the small and blocky levels from the second
you can see hints of those in the bones in the basic structure but its such a mind bending improvement that i think im starting to figure out where most of the time and money wentditto doubly so even for the sound design
mass effect has always had a quirky ethereal quality the soundtrack
the core has been retained but the body has been given a whole new life
its a truly lovely score that supports the action onscreen and makes for some seriously cinematic moments
everything from the light  sad instrumentals that get punctuated by the horrific roar of the reapers down to the nuts and bolts of gunfire and ambient voices  everything is so artfully and splendidly done
if mass effect  wins only one award ever i really really hope its for sound design or mixinglook at me gushing awayexploring the universe  help help ive run out of fuel again
oh so were still flying a ship around on this little map are we
huh
am i the only person who misses the point n click map from mass effect 
just me huh
damni dont have a lot of complaints about this game but ill throw this one out there exploring the galaxy map never congealed into anything more than servicable over the three games
theyve kept the basics from me  piloting a little version of the normandy around a map and rationing fuel
the scanning for resources mini game is gone as are the four resources from me and its been replaced by using broad scans almost like a submarines ping to look for fuel and war assets  weapons people ships and such that can be used to fight the reapers or you know raise your galactic readindess score as you never see or use any of the assets you findi suppose the big changes are that you no longer discover side missions by exploring worlds most are orders from hackett or come through your email in game email not realworld email that would be creepy and that the reapers are actively hunting you in most star clusters more and more of them as the game progresses
do too many pings and a group of reaper ships swoop onto the map to pull the normandy apart
it adds a level of tension to the map navigating but not really in a fun way
more of an im just trying to explore here
argh
sort of way
its not bad but its really indicative of how they never quite figured out what to do with the necessary galaxy map navigation they wanted to make it a more interactive experience a more exciting one i guess
and they did but whyfuel also is a much tighter resource as the normandy has a diminished capacity and the reapers have leveled most of the fuel depots you relied on in me
again it adds a layer of tension and planning but not in any way id call funi guess its also worth mentioning that there are very few new systems to explore
if youve played the first two then youve more than likely been to every system youll see in me and read most of the planet descriptions already
it is the same galaxy after all
i suppose this is why they cut back on exploring and gave us a way to quickly scan each system i suppose that makes more sense than forcing the player to slowly dig through areas of the galaxy theyve already been too that isthe story hey shepard can you fix our deep seeded social issues real quick
thanks
light spoilers ahoy
now were talking  this is what we show up to mass effect for
deep rich variable plots and character development
wow its pretty amazing these things are as popular as they are isnt itim happy to say that the story is a definite mass effect story
an exciting opening  a dramatic turn around  a thrilling final sequence
high points low points exciting reveals
looseends tied up plot threads resolved character arcs completed
everything youd hope for and expected to see is in thererelax im not talking about the ending yet
so calm down
ill get to it in a minute and you can be plenty mad at me then
just hold onthe bulk of the story involves shepard circling the galaxy trying to convince everyone that yes the reapers are something that we should be working together to stop
it sounds a little forced because well it is
but it feels balanced in the end  youre asking species with deep deep hatred for one another to open up all their secrets get superduper vulnerable to each other
so that fact that the krogans or the turians want favors or promises of favors before laying it all on the line kind of makes sense well enough sense to justify the game anyway
if nothing else its a wonderful excuse to tie up plot threads weve been dying to tie up while still keeping focus on the reaper threat and in the end is far more effective than notthe illusive man devolves a little into something of a mustache twirling villain  but for reasons that make sense at least
and the good guys are putting all their efforts into a plotresolving happy ending bomb that makes all the bad guys go away at once which is usually something i hate thanks for thatgears of war   sigh
but again its handled with a little mass effect logic and some class so its not all that bad
theyre all tired plot elements is what im saying but i hesitate to say theyre lazy
nothing about this game feels lazy to merushed though id say that indeed
sometimes really really rushed
hey shepard youre back for retirement or whatever lets go talk to some of these folks who are in charge of something i guess  oh look out repears
everyones dying probably
quick go unite the galaxy well wait here
oh thats james hes new
im sure this is at least partly  the result of real world pressure to get the game out on time and also partly because the dev team had a ton of ground to cover storywise but its still a little disappointing
character introductions are rushed as are a few big story elements wait thessias gone
just already
how
what does that even mean
lots and lots of things happen in this story even before dlc and as a result some of what should probably be the most emotionally compelling parts all the stuff that happens on earth actually end up feeling the most hastily done
i had a much bigger emotional reaction the krogan missions and to the quariangeth struggles than i did with anything that happened on earth because the writers really took their time with those sequences  they cover multiple planets in multiple systems introduce new characters and bring old ones back into the fold
they have action heartbreaking emotion gutwrenching decisions to be made that you feel the effects of and some incredible cinematic moments
i dare say they may be the best sequences in the mass effect trilogy and they happen in the middle of the story
at the beginning and end of the nd act i believe
its hard to believe but  they stuck the best stuff in the middle and left the beginning and the end feeling truncated rushed perhaps even weirdhold on im not there yet
soon my friends soonthe characters huh where is everybody
smore spoilers yallthis is more of an observation than anything else but the roster of characters feels small  which isnt true really its about the size of what we had in me
bigger even with some dlc and you know provided certain people survived meme had a massive cast because the game was about that cast learning about the characters and gaining their loyalty
me is much more about the plot and the bigger story happening but  well most of these folks we know arleady
liara kaidenashley tali  garrus provided theyre alive
even edi we sort of already know though not in this new nude weirdly proportioned form
james is new but who cares
the only real interesting addition the only one we have anything to learn about is javik the prothean available only in the day one dlc
which upset no one at all and only made people very very happy im sureso yeah its a little bit of a backwards slide especially coming off the previous installments when learning about your weirdo crew was a third of the game or more
it is fun to see the old familiar faces on the normandy to celebrate the past or mourn the dead both of which happen as the events of the previous games are felt and weigh heavy on this one
but it would have been good to through one or two new interesting sorry james faces into the mix
javik certainly could have been fleshed out into a full in game character probably should have been in retrospectits a small point to make and is ultimately overshadowed by the plot but it was worth mentioningon the ending thanks for being so patientawwwwwwwww yeah here it isfar and away without a doubt the most hotly debated and fiercely hated part of the game is the last twenty minutes or the last two hours depending on who you talk to
never before outside of like actual politics have i seen such harsh polarization and so many angry angry words thrown about
i can only imagine the bioware offices the day after release when the reactions started flooding in
they must have known there would be some grumbling but could they possibly have predicted such a violent stormwith that said i have to admit i didnt hate the ending so much
i didnt like it i dont think its the best way they could have gone as way confused as to why they did but i didnt hate ityes it is weird
yes its a little out of place
like the beginning of the game it feels hasty rushed even
and yes the last few hours are ultimately disappointing
but it certainly didnt make me angryokay heres my take on the last few sequencesheavy spoilers of courseafter a kickass assault on the illusive man some people call him tim i like to call him louie and a disappointing fight with a magic ninja we finally finally return to earth and things go back to feeling rushed frownyface
were in london for some reason
the reapers have moved the citadel to earth instead of out into dark space or i dont know anywhere else for that matter
oh and this is major coats hes voiced by mark strong and seems really important but dont ask any specific questions about himin what should be the most satisfying emotionally charged point of the game we get a deluge of unanswered or halfanswered questions
everything moves along so quickly so haphazardly so solets take a breather and talk about story structure actually that would take forever and no one cares
so lets just talk about one aspect the obligatory scene
this is something that can be defined many ways but ill sum it up as the scene your audience is expecting to see or the thing that if we dont get it well be really cranky
its essentially the orgasm of your story if that helps
and if were left without it well you get the pointthere are a couple of things that we were hoping to see in mass effect  whether we realized it or not
certain plot threads that had been introduced or ideas that were slipped into our minds
of the many over the course of three games those that stand out to me are massive armies of mixed aliens fighting together the illusive man coming to some kind of conclusion the bloodier the better i hate that guy and a some kind of show down with harbinger the unofficial mascot of the reapers thats been hounding us since me
the events of the previous games have put these thoughts into our heads as the most prevalent most important facets left in the mass effect universe
these are the things that whether we can articulate it at the time or not were expecting to see get played out one way or another before the curtain falls
these are the obligatory scenes based on all the scenes that have come beforeand save for the illusive man and even that ones up for debate they are not addressed
we get two quick scenes of kroganassariturian armies together
no geth anywhere no quarian no salarian elcor batarian anything else weve put time into gathering
thats it
then harbinger shows up whoops our ass good and takes off like hes got  problems and we aint one
and this in my meek little opinion is why the ending is so frustrating
i honestly and truly think that all the starchild weirdness all the plotresolving explosions would have gone over much better if any of these other expected outcomes had been deliveredthis is why i say the team the writers the whomever were hasty and rushed and definitely not bad or lazy
they know these things clearly based on the strengths of the other games
the bioware team doesnt need me to explain story structure to them they know it better than i do and have delivered shining examples time and time again
it makes me feel like the outside world pressed heavy in some way and they had to rush out parts of the game before it was complete
i cant see any other reason for leaving out such obvious and pressing plot points potential plot points i guessi would love a documentary on just what the hell happened but sadly well never ever get oneand you know what
the star child being of light thing doesnt bother me
its an odd choice granted
evertyhing after the final charge on that ohso convenient teleporter beam is odd
they took the esoteric route for some reason the anachronistic route for the first time in the series
it was a brave choice and again i do think that if theyd spent more time satisfying the obligatory scenes it would have gone over better
but it was really surprising in a universe that is so specific and literal to have a sequence that may not be what it appears to be on the surface
that may or may not be a dream or that could possibly be a parable
maybe a cipher of some kind
i don know but its not the sort of thing that easily fits into mass effect which has been a very literal very on the surface sort of game without many unexplained magic or fantasy elements
how mass effect technology works biotics element zero  all these things are laid out clearly and succinctly mostly
i mean i know how many testicles a krogan has thats a pretty specifically laid out world
but once were back on the citadel things become strange dreamlike as though theres something more going on  some grand point being made that lies just beyond explanationmy personal take has always been that once we reach the endgame weve entered into the part of the story that later becomes a fable
for me the most important part of the whole ending are the stargazers buzz aldrin seriously google it and the little kid after the credits talking about tales of the shepard get it
get it
theyre talking about an old story about the person who saved humanity
it sounds like hes telling an origin myth like the garden of eden or noahs flood and all that  a fable about why the world is what it is
seriously after joker and whoever get off the busted normandy have their adam and eve moment and the relays get blowed up just add buzz aldrin saying and thats why the world is the way it is today
it totally feels like they tried to change everything wed been doing for three games into an aesop
once upon a time humans could fly around the galaxy using magical devices called mass effect relays or did you know a long long time ago humans and robots were two different things
and we used to fight each other
until that is the story of the shepardit works but its such an odd choice
i like that it embraces the severity of shepards situation  things are much bigger now than winning or losing a battle
the starchild is forcing him to deal with some high concepts can organics be trusted with the galaxy
can they ever truly control what they create
will this peace between the quarian and geth really last beyond the fight with the reapers or is it a pipe dream
it stretches beyond the battle raging out the window and acknowledges that shepard is at the apex of a cycle that has existed for epochs unknown and in fact unknowable
thats a lot of pressure for one personits weird its potentially heady but its not the worst thing in the world
nor is it the worst ending ive ever seen
i think it could have played out if a it hadnt of been so rushed and b the obligatory scenes were deliveredthe epilogue and an invitation to suck itnone of this as weird and unbalanced as it turned out undoes for me the hundreds of hours of quality entertainment that the mass effect series has brought
 to  of the series is among the most well thought out most imaginative bravest stuff ive seen in the past ten years
ive dreamt of the concept of a connected series of games where the choices i make in one carry over to the next for ages now
and someone managed it  honestly and truly pulled it off
and its gloriousand now it will never happen againseriously why would anyone bother
with all the work that it takes to connect the games in a satisfactory way the thousands of variable scripts that need to be written and accounted for the hundreds of hours spent writing and recording double and triple dialogue for each scene  why would anyone do that again after bioware tried it and all it got them in the end was a pile of bad player reviews and a page of youtube hate videos
i would have been so much easier to just make three straight narratives and in the end the fans appreciated exactly none of it
so why bother
ea will make the exact same amount of money pushing out another madden and will have to deal with zero grief from spoiled unappreciative fansso to all those who cry for boycotts and send hate mail just just suck it
youre ignoring thousands of hours of effort hundreds of hours of lovely gameplay in a world that is more than worth revisiting again and again in a series where the sequels are better than the originals and each adds replay value to the ones before simply by existing name me one other series where thats true
youre dooming us to years and years of more modern warfare clones and halo sequels because as soon as a company takes a risk on something unusual you smack them in the face as hard and as loud as you can if you find any failings at all
the amount of hate ive heard from fans demanding the ending they deserve like petulant children is going to frighten anyone from taking any risks again
so just just suck it alreadyanyone whos bothered to read this far is bound to hit me with and unhelpful or whatever its called and i seriously dont care
leave angry messages whatever i dont carei fully appreciate the mass effect series the ambitious writing the solid action the heartfelt story the diverse characters the excellent sound and music design the unique world
its a series of games built with love and affection and devotion and i cannot fathom throwing all that away because the very last part of the very ending is disappointingand it is disappointing i freely admit that theres no denying that it doesnt work
but to ignore all that has come before all the work and all the love is the pinnacle of immaturity and the epitome of the spoilt selfish childish gamer
this stance murders creativity it does not encourage itenjoy halo  and angry birds  or whatever
im donetldrthis game is simultaneously overrated and underrated
overrated because critics and fanboys blindly gave the game a pass without addressing its glaring near dealbreaking faults such as a curious lack of choice wonky dialogue a cumbersome cover system vague journal entries jessica chobot james vega an inexcusable glitch not allowing me to import my shepard from me and  really bioware
and the now infamous ending
however i would argue that me is also slightly underrated because well the game still has solid combat fun weapons i love the scorpion a heavy pistol that shoots out sticky proximity mines great music and a some genuinely rich emotional moments that strike a chord
the games horrible conclusion and inability or unwillingness to weave my shepards actions from me and  may not enough to ruin the gameseries entirely and for that matter retroactively a la matrix revolutions but its certainly enough to elicit a sense of regret over what could have been the best science fiction story of this current console generation portal  is safe
edit the new patch was not able to fix the face import issue
unacceptable bioware
dropping the game down to one stari hadnt played one or two so far  has been cool so far
i hear the ending isnt great but neither was the ending for mwthe only shooter that ever felt like home to me was moh  all the way until the endexperiencing mass effect  was akin to finishing a great steak only to find a curly hair in your mouth
the last bit ruins the whole in retrospectif you have been following the mass effect series then this game is a must
if youre a newcomer mass effect  will blow your mind and leave you quite a bit confused by the endingthe gameplay is varied and more to the point than previous entries
the combat has been streamlined to give you the best rd person shooter experience everthe cutscenescinematics are amazing some more epic than george lucas could have ever donebioware added a coop multiplayer component to this title that has a direct result to your single player experience
multiplayer is not required to get the best experience
the combat is frantic challenging and a lot of funthere have been a lot of haters who say the ending is horrible and needs to be changed and that the ending ruins the whole experience
ignore these people
bioware has done a great job so far at keeping the mass effect series airtight with no plot holes
that being said the ending leaves what i believe to be plot holes are actually foreshadowing
but if i have learned anything from the mass effect development team they have already planned future dlc that answers a lot and opens more doorsi believe these haters are underestimating bioware and are not paying attention to the subtle clues that the series has been giving us from day oneif you doubt me and dont mind spoilers go to youtube and watch vids on indoctrination theory
i think the best is yet to comeoh and mass effect  with worth the full asking pricethe item is good and no scratch on the discscongrats
the box was ok little bit crushed but the two discs weregoodwarning this contains spoilerslike it matters  bioware showed how much they really care about their loyal mass effect fans with their final game which is to say not very much
the ending excuse me endings leave you with only three slightly different options instead of the  that bioware promised us
heres the overall effect  earth livesdies reapers livedie shepard dies expect for a slight breath at the very freakin end all live dies and then reconverted normandy stranded
even in the good ending all mass effect relays are destroyed which strands every being in the galaxy from one another
no one can see their loved ones in other galaxies ever again and many planets will be starved of precious resources including earth
the entire armada that came to save earth will now end up killing each other over the tiny bit of resources left
there is no happy ending out of all the choices the fans were supposed to have
instead of being the great wild ride that bioware promised to deliver its more like youre given three paths
one is a smooth paved road the other a bumpy dirt path and the last takes you through a rough jungle
no matter which way you go you end up at the same point at the same time just so you can diekill everyonei know changes to a video game are expensive and will likely never happen unless we were lucky enough to see dlc
so you would think that with several thousands of people complaining about the endings bioware would have the decency to at least apologize to the fans that arent happy
nope youre not even getting that
instead of sympathizing with the disgruntled fans bioware staff responsed that they knew what was right for the game
im sorry but when so many people are pissed off about something you did i think you can at least come up with a better answer than we did right
finally you have the whole tali dilemma as well
in mass effect  you had the chance to finally romance tali however you never got to see her face
gamers were left sitting behind the fourth wall as their own character got to look at her face
the most logical step would have been for bioware to show those romancing her into the third game her freakin face
nope you get yet another face blocking video
to add a bucket of salt to your tali wound bioware then adds a little photo to your shepards desk
the photo is supposed to be tali except that tali is nothing more than a photo shopped stock photo from a some company
you can even find the original online
how lazy is that
unless bioware actually listens to their fans and pumps out some amazing single player dlc that addresses the major concerns i strongly urge you not to buy this game
especially at  unless you like a very expensive heart ache
if you want an equal cheaper experience i suggest you get drunk during old yeller while having someone punch you in the stomach
my advice buy the game used and dont give bioware another cent
trust me you wont have any problems finding a used copy since people are so disgusted
or go out and support your local block buster and just rent the gamemass effect  is my last bioware game i plan on buying for a very long timewowwhat a disappointment it was
it was a long saga for me as i preordered the original mass effect when launched and i loved mass effect  even with the watering down
as with dragon age awakenings to dragon age crap aka da bioware has fallen off the cliff
i certainly understand the need to streamline me because of the the realism of a race against time to counter the reapers but cmon they took so much out of it
sorry but this game felt rush rush rush
the ending was generic and predictable as all heck
also the final  min    hour of the game was like a run on cutscene and the  whole ending sequencebarf
i was so disappointed by this game and stacking this against some like skyrim or other deep rpgs like the witcher  really shows how this game falls down
bioware you guys have lost my money and im not sure how much longer i am going to stay in swtor
sorry but i am done with bioware getting my moneythe combat was fun and fluid but after so much of its repetitive combat you just get tired of it
hours on end ive spent in me universe and they all amount to nothing as in the end it was a cheap ending like that episode of the colbys where aliens showed up
just flat out stupid and riddiculous how this story ties up   years of gaming
ill say again sell and buy the game used to depravie bioware ea of the money they so desperately cravefor obvious reason the ending of mass effect  is where i will start my review
having played me four times and me six times along with various saves with various sets of decisions i really looked forward to me  but with apprehension
needless to say much to my disappointment my apprehension became a reality in an unexpected way a highflying tale of grand adventure  and one of the best of all time  crash landed both literally and figuratively at the final momentand it does not matter how i will attempt to salvage the wreckage of an ending that was stolen from ion storms deus ex and badly applied to me whether by believing that its all is a marketing scam to sell more dlcs or get indoctrinated into believing the indoctrination theory or pandering to some copout philosophical concepts like cosmicism  the circle of life the galactic cycle cyclical history etc
 or wait patiently for eabioware to release the ce stands for complete edition in this case or simply made one up on my own the ending still remains what it is and just like the normandy its a wreck
in other words no matter what i dress it up in and how many times i take it out on the dance floor for a spin and what tune we dance to the ending still sucks  thats that and its now out of the way as far as my review is concernedas my star ratings for fun indicated in spite of the pretentious ending not all is lost because there is still a good  hours or so of excellent gameplay here if one can somehow temporarily put aside the ending
granted a hours game is noticeably shorter than me or me but whatever length there is  after whatever eabioware ripped out for dlcs or never get the time to complete   is excellent for the most partright of the bat i noticed that the cover finally features a femshep which gets a thumbup from me as i have more games saves with femshep than maleshep
in addition the game comes on  discs and is stable with only  freezeas for the gameplay  me is the undisputed winner in the combat arena for the me series
although the different races that you can fight against are now narrowed down to human geth and reapers the sub classes within each race have increased significantly and will require you to employ different tactics and team membersalso melee combat is also improved with the addition of a strong melee attack   which your enemies also employed  with a new weapon the omni blade featured on the dvd cover
the cover system have also improved  but still need work shepard is now more mobile and agile than ever but still can inadvertently get into cover position at inopportune timethe most significant improvement of all combatwise is that the enemies have vastly improved ai which really boosts aggressiveness
they will now try to flank you use smoke screen for concealment melee specialists will close in on you snipers will harass you and some enemies even camp out until you saunter past
unfortunately your fire team membersai improvement is a nomatch to your enemies ai
although your teammates can now shoot a little better from cover without tight management they still run head first into hostile fire or into friendly line of fire blocking my view or worse yet come up behind me and try to shoot at the enemies through my helmetalso another minor let down is that for about half of the game in spite of the improved elements the combat itself boils down to the mp style gameplay of holding an area against waves of enemies until a certain event took place this gets progressively worse especially when you returned to earthin terms of rpg in general me is a mixed result between me and me
to be sure me is still has the best rpg elements in the series while me is better than me is some ways but worse in others
to be more precise in tern of conversational options me is the worst by far
way too often  and almost to the point of all the time your choices are limited to either paragon or renegade whereas in me and me there is almost always at least one neutral optionhowever the weapon mods in me  which i really like  are making a big comeback along with a significant increase in weapon upgrades and selections
as for armor there is now a wider selection of armor and armor components for shepard
your team mates armor unfortunately remain purely cosmeticbtw the normandy also saw some improvement most notable is the fact that you can now move about the ship freely
incidentally your teammates also move around the ship  which certainly adds a touch of more realism than beforethankfully mini games have been almost completely eliminated
scanning the planet is now a painless task  and along with planet scanning there is also a totally optional mini game of eluding the reapers  which i do not mind playing i also discover a startling fact while playing this minigame under normal propulsion reapers can move faster than the normandy 
story wise which is the heart and soul of the me series not counting the disastrous ending me also shines brightly in the relatively short amount of game time
the highlight of the story and one that is extremely well done is the resolution of the kroganturiansalarian conflict and the geth vs quarian war  and this part alone is the saving grace of the game for mealso it suffices to say that you will meet all of your former teammates again  provided they did not kick the bucket
some of these former teammates will happily rejoin you again  and if you have hooked up with them before needless to say you will get the chance to rekindle the romance
in short in terms of the story everything that takes place away from earth is noteworthy  if not superbif i have to rank the game in the series itd be ranked precisely in its chronological order of     its too bad me is a cracked diamond
otherwise the ranking would have been   for what its worth i still recommend this game to me fans and new comers alike  but not at full retail pricein conclusion for better or for worse it is what it is and as is the mass effect story has come to an end in my book  and for the most part it certainly was a grand adventure while it lasted
keelah selaiupdate  i give the game an additional star  making it stars  due to the extended cut dlc
although definitely still unworthy of the mass effect series the ec dlc did addressed some plot holes and make the ending choices somewhat better than beforei loved the me series
i played    multiple times testing variations and exploring the gameme  is not a bad game they got a lot of the mechanics right and during most of the game they offered a good experiencebut as we are all mentioning here the endings are not acceptable
either biowareea has absolutely no sense whatsoever not to realize the ending makes no sense and betrays the entire series and not because it is sad or happy but because it is a cheat and stupid or they planned to sell the real ending on a dlc later on
i dont know which is worse if they are so senseless or so corrupt to the point of selling the ending of a trilogy without the ending in order to make a few extra bucksi dare say this failure sets back videogames as a media for storytelling considerablyi also believe that the gaming magazines all of which raved about the game now have two very bad reasonable choices
they can admit the reviewed the game without ending it which would be ok and we would understand why they gave such a review or they should acknowledge they are nothing more than a propaganda mill and their review independence is nill
this game was released less than  days ago and we have already nearly  negative reviews all talking about the endingthis game has the best gameplay out of the trilogy in my opinion
i especially appreciate the fact that sprinting is much faster and i can run for as long as i like unlike in mass effect  with the great gameplay aside we all know the problems the endingfortunately the extended cut came out when i bought this brand new and my xbox had the space so i was able to enjoy the ending or endings somewhat
the extended cut is close to gb however so be awaredespite the ending i still liked the game overalljust beat mass effect   the entire game im thinking to myself the ending will no doubt blow my mind beyond any comprehension
to my surprise it was a huge letdown
i wont spoil it for anyone but i just have to say  ea or bioware please release a dlc that gives me a better ending  an example would include perhaps a romanced personi was deadset on rerolling all  games until the massively disappointing plot wrap up
boo bioware booupdateafter reviewing various boards since game completion ill say this bioware  make it right or you and i are donezo what
donezono but really i dont plan on buying anything you touch unless its fixed played this series since game one expected my choices and such to carry over into mass effect  nope
had to deal with characters discussing things that ive never done in the me series and then the horribly bad endingif you want to actually play this pile go for ithowever biowareea can go suck a fatty instead of taking my money ever againthis game is the culmination of three video games and hundreds of hours of obsession
i have played the first two titles over and over
this game is a lot of what i was looking for in a sequel but doesnt measure up to the original in my book
maybe i am simply too old school where rpgs are concernedi too was not able to import my sheps face
dont believe the hype this isnt a cloud save issue
even if it was it doesnt excuse iti am being penalized apparently for buying  of their games
i have an me save imported to me and that somehow disables my shep from keeping his facei even checked the presets because i think my shep was a preset slightly modified and found no one who looked close
its a let down and a disappointment and to me i now feel i wasted money to get release day shipping ie
shouldve waited for a sale or price dropuntil its fixed i wont be able to enjoy my game and i hope bioware andor ea does something to apologize to their loyal customers
the low rating is to help warn people who are like me before they spend their money and because i effectively cannot play my game the same day i purchased it because of a bugi knew it would be hard to keep the series going strong but this is a pretty poor start
and to those who poo poo on people complaining about this bug
a bug is a bug is a bug and this is unacceptable
they knew they were going to sell enough copies to release daydlc so they shouldve did some quality controlps  to add insult to injury i had to patch the game for some reason out of the boxi bought and gave away this game before the huge extended cuts came but before that i dont see what all the fuss was about
the entire story is epic importing me characters was easy enough and the online multiplayer is pretty cool though it lacks enough gameplay modes and shouldnt need to be played to get the best possible outcome in the game especially since you need to buy a pass seperately if you get this game secondhandmy wife asked me why do you like to play video games
i told her video games arent just games anymore but living breathing movies and that is exactly what the mass effect series is
a living breathing story that you get to decided how it endsthe fact that i have been able to determine the end of my saga as commander shepherd is unheard of in gaming
the fact that decisions i made back in s mass effect are coming to fruition today in  i recommend this game to everyone that loves interactive storytellingconcerning the game almost everything is as good or better than mass effect  the graphics are better the controls are better the menus are better the voice acting is amazing
the ending of this game though as many have complained is really bad
plot holes abound as well as the muting of antagonist that simply become puppets
wtf is all i have to say
it is clear that mass effect  never went through any type of quality control or feedback from game testers because not only did it have bugs not allowing the importation of custom characters from the previous two mass effects which was the most touted feature of the series but nobody in their right mind would have gone with that ending with a happy hell ya that was awesome
i kid you not its that badim not surprised since this game is coming from ea
they are the  worst company in americabottom line the game is awesome
it does have fantastic game play fantastic voice acting and animations has a great storyuntil the very fricking end
hopefully the extended cut dlc ending that bioware was forced to release this coming summer do to the backlash fixes the terrible ending and makes us all happyin conclusion this should have been a  out of  game
because of the ending i give it i dont know why so many me geek fans were upset
this video game was killer
way better than the second
and the ending was beautiful what more can you expectwhat can i say about mass effect 
it seems that most people agree that this game is fanatasic up until the last  minutes or
honestly i really loved this game and it nearly surpasses the first two
but the endings totally goes against the game
but here are my pointsthe goodseeing all of our favorite characters return was the best thing ever
having garrus and tali in the party again felt perfect and bringing back old favs like liara and ashleykaiden made this team feel almost complete
only two new characters one is dlc join the team and they have interesting backstories but no loyalty missions sadly
edi finally picks up a gun and now joins the fight
the rest of the team from me are still around and they help out sheapard with certain missions
some complain that they were only cameos which i strongly disagree
they appear more than once and some play an important role in the story
it isnt like they come in only to go hi shepard
bye shepard
it still felt great to see all of them and still have moments with them
on top of that they all have a kind of banter with each other
from james not catching javiks jokes to garrus catching up with liara
this was something me truly lacked and this game made up for it
we even see certain minor characters make comebacks like conrad verner
this to me felt rewarding to the playeremotional impact
there were plenty of moments in this game that had me in tears
from seeing some of my favorite characters die to seeing a planet getting reduced to rubble
this game truly had me on the edge
there was plenty moments where my heart was pounding in excitment
the story was well written until the ending and it did hit me in the right areasthe gameplay went through minor but nessesary changes
you can now roll and melee in the battles
the opponites are tough in a fun way instead of a fustrating way
the gameplay may be a bit gears of war light but it didnt bother me a bit
it was fast paced and fun
although they abandon heavy weapons as item you need to pick up insteadthe voice acting is still spot on
i really loved all the characters personalitys
although that one chick from ign that appears in this game needs acting lessonsthe story is still greatly written
it had a dark feeling of dred and desperation to it
but it wasnt completly devoid of its lighter humorous moments
i did feel powerful at times
i could make peace between two centry old rival races or condem one in favor of the other both with a satisfying result
i was really feeling like a hero in the makingcustomized weapons
i can now add certain mods to all of my weapons for better states
it almosts gives this game a slight rpg feel to it
i can also customize my armor too giving my shepard a uniqe looklevel design missions are great
while most are liner than the first two games they still have a fun factor to them
nothing looks the same and they all look uniqe
from mars to grissom school to the ardat yatshi if thats how you spell it templethe badsome missions are simply petty fetch quests
half the time youll hear someone talking about an item either a book or an artifact they need for whatever reason
all shepard has to do is go the planet the item is one then scan it and bring it back
it get pretty boring at times and they could have had invovled side missionsthe mission journal is almost useless now
it doesnt keep track of your progess like the first  games did
they dont collapse to reveal what you need to do next
most of the time it doesnt tell you where you need to go
such as it would say i have to go a certain planet but it doesnt tell me what system its in
i spent a half hour trying to find certain planets
it would have been great if it kept up with my progressthere isnt to much talking with the choice wheel
sometimes when you talk to teammates its in a set way where your only listening to the characters speak rather than interact
kind of similar to the converations with kasumi  zaeed in mecollecting war assests for noting
one of the main things that got me hooked was gathering different races to fight for you
like the geth krogan rachi and batarians
even some charaters offer hired guns to help out
i expected it to be like dragon age origins where you saw the different races come to your aid and can be called upon to help in the final battles in that game
i wanted to see those races fight with their own ships or their own skills on the ground
instead we only see humans fight in the final battle while we only see some of the other races report in
the only good the war assests are for is raising your galactic readiness so we can get the better endingthe final battle was almost a let down
while my heart was still pounding during some scenes in this fight i still felt more could have been done
i wanted to retake earth from the reapers slowly but surly
i wanted to go to certain places like new york to tokyo while taking down speical types of reapers
i wanted my war assets to play a major role
i wanted a suicide  type mission where certain teamamtes can die or war assets if you made the wrong choices
instead it was a liner mission in london where the choices have no impact
while it still gave me a certain feeling of dred in my first playthrough i felt it could have needed morethe ending
what more do i have to say
everybody knows how bad the endings are
they are full of plot holes that goes against me lore
introducing a new character that gives you a terrible as in poorly done reason the reapers do what they do
it ruins the impact of the reapers and it demystifies them too
then the endings are nothing but a typical choose abor c the endings themselves have little to no difference to them
each one all leds to the same unsatifying result
the endings gives us more questions than answers
it lacked closer
we dont see how the universe is shaped or what my team does after the battle
the game just ends faster than you can say wtf
but what really makes me mad is the fact that there is no option for a happier ending
why does shepard has to die in game about making choices on how we want a story to play out
why are the villains goals cerberus  reapers the right choices while the heros goal shepard  anderson the wrong one
while i give credit to bioware for trying something different this ending just feels more disconnected to the rest of the game than any ending in other gamesthe okmultiplayer
i didnt feel like me ever needed multiplayer
the game should have only focased on its single player campain
but mp was actually somewhat enjoyable
it has a very left  dead horde mode feel to it
it was also a great oppertunity to play as our favorite races
i had fun bashing reaper troops as a krogan
i thought it was clever too that they had mp affect your readiness in the main game
it gives you reason to play it
but mp does get boring after a while
all you do is survive all  rounds with only small objectives like guard this post or take down a certain ai
it gets boring after a whileoverall i think mass effect  was a total step up from the first two games
there were tones of moments in the game that made my heart pound
but the overall climax and ending was a big letdown
the ending could ruin the game or the series for most because we know that our choices arnt going to matter
but if your like me and you can just shrug off the ending youll be in for a ride with this game
but bioware really needed to do something about the games endings
wheter its them giving us a version that makes sense or they flat out change it they need to know that they did something wrong
i refuse to believe that they or any pro reviewerare actually happy with the ending
but they still have yet to make dlc for this games so we can only waitedit okay so ec explained some things out and filled in alot of holes
its a soso ending for the series now but it does end the series not leaving us reaching out blindly anymorewhile i still would like to know about shepards life after the wardoes shehe live after that breathe scene
im not all that upset anymore more due to the fact that ive moved on than anything that eabioware has donei would suggest playing it now just not for the story anymore just for the combatedit okay so bioware might be able to make a come back ifvery big if the dlc ending that they are going to give for free at the end of the summer sorts everything out
truthfully im not holding out hope for it
the explaination of this new ending stuff is just that bioware will clarifytheir word not mine what happened in the ending
i dont want their ending clarifiedi want the ending that my character my shepard was working towards the one i the believed would be possible especially after they claimed to have  different endings
only time will tell if this ec saves me or if it just finished digging the hole for ea to dump bioware intobioware did a great job on the gameuntil the ending itselfthey really dropped the ball there and at the moment it seems like they dont care about that or the fact that the customers and fans are both angryupset about itive been a loyal bioware customer for years now and an even more loyal mass effect fangirlyes we girls play it too
i was so excited about this but nowi cant even bring myself to look at the games because i know that all the work i did all the choices that i took they didnt mean anything it was all a lie uselessif bioware wanted this to be how it ended then i really cant see how they are going to keep business anymore because i know that myself and all the other fans that are outraged by this tragedy are not going to be giving them our money anymorei first got into mass effect after watching my brother in law play the first one
it looked cool but i wasnt about to drop another  bucks that year after gears of war and halo  plus call of duty  were all reserves for me
so when my mother in law rip
msjumanah said i could get a video game for my birthday gift i thought why not try mass effect
the first mass effect was epic in my opinion
the choices the combat the custimazation was insane
long story short i loved it
shortly after that my mother in law passed away
she was very kind to me even though i didnt deserve it
mass effect was one of the best gifts anyone has given me
i am talking about the adventure
i was stoked for the second one when it was released
i drove all the way from baltimore to lancaster to get my copythe second me was just as awesome with new and returning characters
different places to explore
new races to encounter
i even bought all the dlc kasumi zaeed overlord
mass effect  really got me into dlc period
plus my biggest draw to the second was the import feature
all your past choices and actions followed you into the second game which i dont think any other game has ever done on a console
i even replayed the st game to boost my characters level for the upcoming import into part now fast forward a few years
here comes part  i am ready to stomp the reapers and save the galaxy and get it on with liara my romantic choice
i am again replaying the first and second games to level boost and refresh the choices i made while playing
i have tried to stay away from the spoiler reviews and will update this once i get my collectors edition in afghanistan and finish the fight yes i aped halo  and see the ending for myself
maybe it will be bad or good but i am going in open minded and see what bioware has in store for me
i dont finish many games but mass effect good ending or terrible one will be regardless one of my fondest memories in gaming
thank you mother in law
love youmass effect  is probably one of my favorite games
the mechanics of the first two games are maintained without being stale
the story is great
all around just an awesome gameme is one the best game out there
currently theres a huge crisis about the me endings sadly things are not always appreciated or sometimes people forget about future or some gratitudego to the store buy the game you will enjoy it dream about it feel desperate to understand the adventure and people thoughts about the endinganyway choice you take at the very endit will be up to you your interpretation and your very personal expectationsme is not perfect like everything else in this world
dont look for plotholeslook for possibility new games new story continuityi hope you play and enjoy iti am shocked at how many people can give such a great game a onestar rating simply because they didnt care how it ended
did you get lost in the lore or the mass effect universe
i did
did you put s of hours into the franchise and enjoyed every minute of it
i did
did you have difficulty making key morally gray decisions
i did
mass effect is well worth the proper five star rating
give it a chance and ignore the naysayers
i just finished it and actually enjoyed the ending
i though it was a great game head to toei imported my character from mass effect to mass effect  to mass effect   the choises i picked led to a good ending for mass effect  some people are complaining about the ending
i had no problem with the game or story at all
a good ending to a great trilogythis series has been my favorite in all of gaming and this last one did not disappoint
loves me some female shepardthis was the first game that i ever bought at a midnight release party and that i spent the extra money for the collectors edition version
why
because biowares mass effect series is the best video game series ever
you know how i know this
i know this because i generally hate rpgs and if i can be so obsessively devoted to a single gaming franchise that happens to be an rpg then you can take that to the bank
as mass effect  stands from a pure gaming standpoint its near perfect and its an improvement from the first two games
no more annoying planet scanning a smoother combat system no more ridiculous minigames tighter and more seamless graphics epic battlesthe real problem that almost everyone is having with this game is with the last hour of the game
and while i understand the frustration with that ending and even share itits time to stopthis is not a  and a half star game
its time to stop with all of the outcry against the ending and having that be the only reason youre all giving it one or twostar reviews
before you get to that last hour of the game you are in awe of everything that has come before it
the epic sensibilities of the conflicts the engaging sidemissions the moving dramatic stories of each character you still love that stuff
this is what makes the mass effect games worth playing
did anyone moan and groan about how admittedly lame the final confrontation between shepard and saren was in the first game
no
i get it
i know youre angry
when i was playing it i was loving it
a few days later i didnt like the ending
a few days after that i hated it
i didnt feel like bringing back my femshep from me and  to run through her mission since i had just done my commander shepard character brought from me and  just to have her run into the same endingi know where the anger comes from bioware promised us an epic resolution to possibly the most epic series of all time
bioware also promised that just about every decision you make in this game will have an effect on the ending
they didnt completely live up to that promise so it makes it seem like all the decisions you made are for nothingits not
despite the fact that you dont like the ending doesnt mean that the journey there wasnt totally worth it because it was
it took me some time to come to this realizationhopefully before you give it the kneejerk bandwagon reaction most of you are youll think about what an awesome time you had playing the game up front and not have tunnelvision merely on the ending stars  but youll play it and love it just like me
incredibly fun but incredibly disappointing as welli love mass effect and play a few replays as well as numerous saves to get all the good options
i took off half of a star for the release date dlc which was  dollars
i purchased it foolishly for the extra conversations with my teammates
i didnt feel chock full of great conversations like i did in mass effect   i liked that the support roles played a bigger part the reporter the kelly replacement the shuttle pilot but i was able to have very few conversations with my teammates liara seemed to have the most options for talk
i imagine if i had one less conversation with every member because i didnt purchase the dlc i would have been pretty disappointedokay
second so many early quests are do something that helps the war effort and happens to bring you in contact with one of your old crewmates
i took off a half star for this because it wasnt natural
everyplace i went i met an old buddy
it just didnt feel natural and each time i was surprised like omg i thought id never see you again but the reality was i was pretty much in the phone book looking up old contactsi took off a half star for the endings
literally there are  endings which apparently they call  endings even though they only have teensie weensie minor differences based on your war readiness
i took off half a star for the fact that i have to play multiplayer to get my war readiness high enough to get the good ending
i have a feeling this is an antipiracy ploy but for those of us who dont really care to play non firstpersonshooter multiplayer it kind of sucks
mass effect doesnt have roots in online multiplayer why should i have to do that
edited again   i did have a bug regarding my ending availability that did occur again from the end game sequence but didnt occur again from the end game mission
instead of getting three options i only got twoi added a star because of the cute conversations that happen when your team roams around the normandy
my favorite
catching two beloved friends having a daybeforewedie makeout session
i also loved how they would be on the talking on the intercom with the others
cutei liked the new and improved weapons loadout which was simple but not as simple as me
the addition of weight and its affect on your powerrecharging speeds is pretty neat
gameplay and strategy feels great on hardcore and im looking forward to some frustration if i do decide to play insanityi liked the balance of powers
i didnt much care for the fact that there wasnt a bioticcombat vanguard character on the squad
yeah the dlc new guy is one but that kind of doesnt count
it makes the releasedate dlc seem that much crummier
i also feel like i didnt have enough playable characters
that said i wish they had picked push over pull as far as biotic powersi removed a half star because there were a few parts that didnt make sense with the plot
theyre not huge but just kind of nonsensical
no spoilers
not all are focused around the messy endings but a lot of them areon one hand i want to play to see if i had not saved some characters in me how my experiences would have gone
on the other hand i realize it just brings me to those three bland endings and i get kind of sad
i do want the character interaction so perhaps ill just replay the first few quests the meetformersquadmates on the war effort ones and see what happens thereill tell you after romancing the drell thane in me i can say i was pretty short on romance in my life and pretty high on tears
those scenes were great
the growing desperation of other races and the scope of the game
fantastic
bringing the universe together to fight on a single front
oh my
i had feared that side quests would either be phased out or seem out of place but they all seemed quite reasonable
theyre all bring this to me if you see it during your search
whats really cool is that your shipmates come aboard the citadel so you can speak to them elsewhere
i thought this was a nice touch
i was impressed with a lot of things but i dont think its the same caliber as the first two gamesif i hadnt played me and me i would probably give this game a  but coming down from so much conversation and these great cinematic endings that just made you feel so goddamned good to these weak cinematic endings that pretend to give you options and choices
i think its a natural progression though when handling something with such scope its very hard to strike the balance that pleasesalso its not that the ending is bittersweet or unhappy that bothers me its just the way its done
its almost worse than the matrix
i know the writers are great so im going to have to ask for an ending redooh
and i read the dietz book in the mass effect universe so if you have look forward to some nice bits from thereafter  hours of shooting monsters playing diplomat and trying to romance fellow crew members my time with mass effect  came to a close and i had to decide whether or not to start up a new game
its not very often i feel like im a part of a video game trilogy thats spanned almost five years and its incredibly satisfying seeing how the gameplay has changed improved and expanded in this series
unfortunately mass effect has been a surprisingly unpolished video game since the start and for every improvement mass effect  has made a lot of the flaws in this series have gone uncheckedunlike the original mass effect and the  minutelong tutorialcharacter creator that began mass effect  mass effect  wastes no time throwing you from the character creatorimporter into its main conflict series villains the robotic reapers are attacking earth and destroying everything in their path
as the hero commander shepard you must escape offplanet and rally help from other alien races before things get worse
needless to say the story in mass effect  hits on some serious levels and the feeling of this is the end is realized from the beginning with a powerful music score and images of buildings burning people and children dying and reapers tearing through cities in the background
like mass effect and mass effect  the narrative in this epic tale doesnt always hold up to scrutiny and i wouldve loved to have more time with some of the returning characters like jack jacob and grunt but mass effect  knows how to deliver its emotional punches and i found myself cheering and choking up a couple timesas with the previous games mass effect  has you playing equal parts soldier and diplomat before giving shepard help the other galactic races have you solving their problems which involve fighting off the prohuman splintergroup cerberus as well as brokering peacetreaties
while the dialogue wheel is present with some but not a lot of paragonrenegade options solving conflicts and gathering resources in the normandy gives you numeric score or war assets
the total number of assets you have determines how the story will play out in the end ie
how much help you have before join the battle on earth
im not completely a fan of numbers playing such a big role in decision making especially with the added galactic readiness chopping things in half if you dont use the multiplayer but its an interesting if impersonal way for your decisions to impact the storythe storymoments in mass effect  carry the same strong cast and voiceacting as the previous installments with freddie prinze jr a welcome addition as lieutenant james vega but the combat has received a major overhaul
gone are the tom clancylite moments of me and the empty corridors and minigames of me combat is fast and frenetic as guns have a lot more weight to them feeling more like vanquish or gears of war than previous me games
enemies rush you from every direction in normal mode and youll have to dodge cover and combine squad powers to take down the strongest of them
this creates great moments of tension while still making you feel like a total badass
the only problem i had was that some of my classpowers didnt work half the time which became frustrating when i had to rely on them namely the infiltrators snipefocuswhile i can deal with the war assets and some unreliable classabilites as i played mass effect  i kept asking myself one question why is this game series after three games still having the same technical issues
graphics fade in and out limbs and characters disappear and to make matters worse i cant import my character appearance ive had since me
again nothing that really killed my enjoyment of the game  i eventually came up with something that kindasorta looked like my character but seeing these problems still present after five years is both disappointing and little heartbreakingthe ending of mass effect  has caused some outrage among fans demanding both explanations and complete rewrites of the game
i understand the disappointment as there are no clearcut story resolutions nor is there much difference in the endings youre given
but even if i hated the finale i didnt the endings never been what i remember about a video game and frankly it doesnt come close to ruining how much fun the gameplay is or forgetting the moments that had me choking up on the tuchanka missionsin the end i restarted mass effect  and am still enjoying the hell out of it the multiplayers surprisingly fun too
i really hope theres updates to fix the character importer and classpowerglitches and as of  biowares added more dlc to flesh out the ending but overall im very happy with the experience
if youre new to the series you definitely want to start out with the first game as theres so much carryover from the previous titles many conflicts from the previous games like the krogan genophage and quariangeth war are finally resolved but i think mass effect  stands very well as a conclusion to the trilogyinitially i already had it made up in mind that this game was  perfect game and quite possibly the greatest game ever made
i flipped from site to site to read reviews to see if others shared my insight and was shocked to find so many that felt the complete opposite
i told myself they must be new guys because nobody thats a true fan dating back to  would speak so negatively
i was wrong of the game prior to the end is fantastic
everything is improved
i really thought the graphics were exceptional
and it was nice seeing old faces from  and  side by side
even the multiplayer is good
sadly its not enough
the new journal stinks and all the enemies do is launch nonstop grenades at you which is an instant death on insanity
spoilers belowthe endinga new and unknown character depicted as a young boy who presume to be ai or synthetic comes out and proclaims to the be the creator of the reapers
he then proceeds to the reaper cycle is a solution with the purpose being to stop the chaos of the created synthetics killing their creator organics
he goes on to say that they take killharvest the strong races to ascend them while also allowing weaker races to flourish
he proclaims to have seen it all before and also claims to know how it always ends
he then tells shepard that hope is useless
lastly he rejects any suggestions or concerns given by shepard and in return tells him what his only options arewhy it suckedfirst who and what is this boy
and what happened to the reapers just being a synthetic race similar to the geth
now all of a sudden there this new ai leader
why have we been looking at sovereign and harbinger prior to now thensecond this solution has only one beneficiary and thats synthetics
everytime organics grow in strength here come the reapers to harvest us which in return makes them smarter and stronger
if the purpose is really to ascend a race why not choose a weaker race
but no the weak are left behind because they do not pose a threat
why did the reapers start attacking human colonies  because they posed a bigger threat than the other organics
how come this solution doesnt call for any synthetics to die
organics have our own natural solution
whether its old age diseases or violence  no organic lives forever with being wiped out
in short we dont need his solutionthird if this boy as a synthetic cares so much about the life of organics and the preservation of synthetics why doesnt he use the reapers as a means to control his fellow synthetics
they are the problem
synthetics are machines not people
they are created for specific purposes
the problem arises when they become too smart on their own and no longer want to do what they were created for
this is what causes the said chaos
so instead of punishing organics the reapers should round up reprogram or killshut down the rebellious ai
with this boys solution organic creators are submitting to their created synthetic
thats not how it works
they want to be  and then dictate
this boy has overstepped his boundaries by not only deciding the fate of synthetics but also organics
and no one asked him for this
initially the only hostile synthetics were geth and after the quarian left they stayed on their planet to themselves and in peace
it was another synthetic reapers that made them hostile again
so again who is the real problemfourth hope is not useless
hope is a strength of humans that other races sometimes mock but ultimately admire
hope led shepard to defeat matriarch benezia saren and sovereign a reaper in me
hope led shepard to assemble a team of mixed races despite cultural tensions that existed to come together and take down harbinger and a collector base in me
hope is what allowed shepard to unite all organic life and end past wars for the sake of fighting the reapers united
id say hope is pretty damn usefulfifth when shepard says wed like to stay who and how we are because otherwise wed just be machines doing as were told and the boy rejects it why is shepards input no longer relevant from that point
the boy gets to say what the only options will be
the boy claims to know it all yet he admits in the same sequence that his solution is flawed or will not work
well what else is wrong about
he never foresaw or knew shepard would make it far enough to be there standing with him but there he shepard was which proves him the boy wrong againsixth since when does shepard move to the beat of someone elses drum
all throughout  and  shepard was persistent in what he was doing
if you cooperated  great if you didnt he found a way to do it anyway
he did it his way
now when the boy poses him with only  options depending on war assets readiness etc
 hes left forced to choose one
what happened to the do it my way or give me death shepardseventh the socalled best ending is actually the worst
i love shepard but who is he decide synthesis is acceptable for all organics
thats not what everyone united and was fighting for
this chance at a new life is nonsense
either hybrids become machinelike which is a failure or they still have free will which puts us back to square one
krogan and salarian are both organics
whats stopping them from warring again after they become hybrids organicsynthetic in this new chance
in this best ending reapers still get what they want
meanwhile synthesis marks the end of all of organic life because everything going forward will either be organicsynthetic or all synthetic
also cant hybrids with free will still make full synthetics and chaos return
since the boy is allowed to predict the future in one of his options i will as well that leaves room for the possibility of hybrids no longer being acceptable which would mostly like start another cycle
sounds like another case of synthetics being the problem
another option has shepard becoming synthetic so he can control the reapers
really
he did all this work just to become one
wrong answer
the last option is to kill all synthetics now but eventually because the boy supposedly knows it all the same problem or chaos will return
this is a slap in the face to organics because it basically says you cant be trusted or youre incapable of managing yourselves so let us assume what you will do and what you need
however this option offers the best ending among the crap were left to choose from
not because shepard and anderson lives but because shepard can do what he came for to killremove the reaper threat
according to the boy chaos will return due to our children creating synthetics but as i mentioned before the boy has been wrong several times before
also in accomplishing this defeat the races of the world can leave behind very detailed and complete instructions as to what to do if in fact the reaper cycle comes back similar to what the protheans were trying to doto be clear all the endings suck because none account for each players unique experience
some will argue that leaves too many possibilities for the developers to account for
to that i say that sounds like personal problems
creating a series stretching across  games with the ability to import decisions was their choice
theyre the ones said how you play will affect your end
while i applaud the initiative they chose to take on that challenge
if the challenge became more than they could handle own up to it
players simply want what was told to useighth where are the benefits or penalties of my decisions
someone that has  experience in the first  games or a renegade shepard with no likeability and no race cooperation gets the same ending as someone that solves race conflicts and establishes galactic peace across  games
what was the point then
all deaths were in vain including shepards
who cares about maelons data
why did mordin sacrifice himself to spread the cure if we cant continue living as as is wo modifications
why did shepard fight across  games to give in to someone elses logic
a logical ending would have posed the boys options to a renegade player killed squad mates and did nothing to bring about peace
paragon players should have been able to make the boy adjust his way of thinking since he had been proven wrong
and if wouldnt adjust his thinking a fight would ensue see 
signs of a crappy ending were written on the wall im sad to admit
i feared this may happen when i saw an option to play wo making decisions
why is that even there
how can a decisionbased game be played wo making decisions
and they get the same end as someone whos invested  hours
they made this game as if it were a standalone in an attempt to cater to newcomers
what about the original and diehard fans
the only effect importing savesdecisions had was in dialogue
thats just bad business
some will say that its more about the journey
to that i say dont make me laugh
yes journey is important because you wont care enough to reach an end
however whenever you start something the objective is always the end
you dont start watching a part miniseries to stop after the th part and say this has been a great journey
i think ill stop here do youninth and final where was the final boss fight
you do all that fighting to reach the end just to pick a multiple choice conclusion which they claimed they wouldnt do
when is shepard going to face off against harbinger who i respect more than some unknown boy
wheres the battle of human vs the ultimate machine for all of mankind
where was the largescale epic battle with all the people i recruited
even me had everyone together in action
at this point the enemy thresher maw was more useful than the rachni queen
why did i save wrex in  to never be able to use him again
who cares about guest appearances especially when all the other original crew members are accessible
at this point i wouldve rather died in a fight to the death than just roll over and make a decision
then im expected to buy dlc to further the legend
thats disgustinga quick note to everyone who thinks they should remake the end let it go
having played through me  times and me  times plus all the dlc im just as disgusted by it as many of you are
if you choose to boycott future titles thats entirely up to you and it would be completely understandable
i say to let it go in regards to mes ending because even if they did remake it we still wouldnt be happy
were po and rightfully so
the damage has been and at this point theres very little they can do to right it
even if they made a new end i doubt it would be free thus having to pay for it would only throw more salt in our woundsread all the other great reviews for this game and youll get the idea  i love the franchise
the only problem i had with this game was that it just felt way too much like the nd one
i also spent too much time trying to do a bunch of side missions having items that pointed me to planets that i couldnt get to yet but didnt realize which was frustrating flying around for hours looking for something youre not able to find until you progress to a certain part of the storythe ui wasnt as user friendly as before as well
the multiplayer was really fun with friends though
lots of good strides to make some of your online characters available in the singleplayer game as well good stuffup front this game is a lot of fun to play
my problem is that on day one they want another  bucks for content that was completed and should have come with the game
not right to purposely exclude content and make us pay more on day freaking one
i totally get if they want to expand the game as time goes but if you were done with it already then add it in the game and make it as complete as possible
also we need to take a stand against the online pass to play these games online
we are already paying for xbox live why should we be punished if we were smart enough to buy the game used
if you dont buy the game new then they are just double charging us to play online
not coolthe first  games were amazing really showed how a story could be written that shows decisions and consequences then in the is game we get to pick a color at the end
really that was bioware epic end to this game dont buy this game nothing but a huge letdown and waste of timeonly  hours in and ive done  maybe  main quests and plenty of sidequests
in this game the sidequests actually have a purpose and you get to have some interesting encounters through them
dont buy into the whole dlc nonsense some people here are selling
ive yet to here one argument that took into account that the dlc character was a last minute thing that wasnt added to the main game
if it was so important im sure id get some gap in the understanding of story something ive yet to see
if you played the demo then you know what to expect gameplay wise
me personally i didnt pay much attention to any frame rate issues in the demo but even i can tell they polished up the system a bit more
from the first  or so minutes into the game youre already making crucial decisions that will affect the rest of the game
story wise the game grabs you straight after the the first mission
the lively cast of characters are back and they all certainly have their own methods of operations and their own values in this war thus adding a lot more depth to them as individuals
i wont say that if you played me this is for you because to me they honestly feel different somehow
me personally i didnt play mecouldnt really get into it but loved me and me
hope you all found this helpfuli didnt really care one way or another about the ending
what bugged me were the countless times i had to control a slowmoving shepard
so annoying
the dreams the woundedshepard near the end
and that difficulty level spiked tremendously during the finale
why throw so many banshees at me
not fairother than those complaints i found this almost as enjoyable as the last game
i actually miss the resource mining from mass effect  even though most found it tedious
overall a fun though notasinvolving experience
im glad i playedyes the ending wasnt the greatest but the game itself still leaves other games in the dust
now with dc they fixed some of the questions
but to people who will rate a game  star and then say just because an ending didnt agree with them they give it a  star are acting like my kids
thats why  and  stars were invented people
so here i go giving a  star game a  star maybe to help off set some bad press
bioware has always made the best games i remember playing baldurs gate on my old computerthe game is so good all around
story game play feels like gears of war mixed with star wars the acting etcthe ending was awesome too
except you need to be a lover of philosophy to truly get it and yes i got it
lol i think the people who got upset had no idea what they where looking at so they immediately got upset
but even if your not into games that make you think the action definitely makes up for ityes the end is lacking
however i still enjoyed the overall experience
starting from me its interesting seeing how the characters develop and some of the choices in me and me affect me
i believe an expansion is coming soon that gives the a better ending for freeif you have played the entire mass effect series like so many of us have i cannot imagine a bigger letdown than this the third and final commander shepard installment
the gameplay seems to take the worst aspects of the previous  and cram them all together in a halfa attempt to apparently do nothing other than bring in a few hundred million dollars of profit and upset a lot of ea gamers
i could probably sit here and write  or  pages worth of why this game falls short but i will try to stick to the highlightsfirst off there are not nearly enough carryovers as ea promised from your choices in the first  games and the ones that are evident are pretty much limited to dialogue and cutscenes  so basically you wasted those few hundred hours playing the first  mass effectssecondly the game is way too straight forward
there are no hidden missions and barely any side quests that add to the story and help your character as in the first   the ones that are there often consist of no more than a few lines of dialogue and some coercion rather than a sideplot or missionand of course as im sure youve read the ending will make you wish you never wasted one second of your life playing this game
without getting into too much detail i will try to explain  the ending of the game starts out ok but the choices you are given seem to have literally no effect on the actual ending of the game and shepard series and nothing is followed though
the ending wouldnt be nearly as bad if it just wasnt cut so short
it really seems like they just didnt care to properly end the game and just put something together off the top of their heads because they didnt feel like putting forth the effort to have a proper ending   i realize there are people who say you cant please everyone but i dont think they pleased anyone with the lack of detail and effort they put or didnt put into the endingin short if i hadnt spent god knows how many hours playing the first  mass effects and making sure i had all the choices i wanted to go into the final of the trilogy i probably wouldnt be nearly as upset
however i think most people who have played or will play this game did play the first  and its just inexcusable how lackluster this game iswas
if youve played the first  its almost mandatory to buy this one for some closure if nothing else but i would say wait until this summer when they release their extendedtweaked ending so you dont experience the same disappointment and anger i did when i finished this gamelike many of the other reviews i think the ending is goofy
not much variation in the  choices at the end and it ends with a plot twist that is introduced at the very end that doesnt seem to fit well
i guess i see the connection with the geth  quarian story but stillnonetheless most of the game is really good
if you liked me youll like me just anticipate some disappointment in the endingwhen mass effect was first released it felt very much like a bioware game a kind of scifi shooter rpg that didnt feel too different from previous bioware efforts while also paying direct homage to the halcyon days of scifi cinema even including a visual film grain filter
its easy to forget how the series started out how the gameplay has improved dramatically how the storytelling has grown more rich the characters more fleshedout as the saga of commander shepard has rolled on
and with mass effect  the trilogy has come to a close and with the extended cut dlc the series has ended on a powerful and moving note one which leaves no doubt in my mind that bioware has crowned their achievement appropriatelyafter the events of mass effect  shepard is effectively grounded until the reapers show up and start reaping
while it might seem like a rehash of the previous games approach of rounding up a rogues gallery of colorful characters mass effect  differs in that its not about putting together a motley crew of heroes and antheroes its about marshaling the strength of many different sentient races to try to save earth and hopefully do what it takes to stop the reapers altogether to break the cycle of growth and destructionone cant say too much about the story without spoiling it and the conclusion is still problematic for those who wanted a more customized ending
that being said this entire game goes back to what players did in the prior titles
the actions you chose the decisions you made impact story elements throughout
characters who died wont be back and those who survived add to the missions as they normally would
past lovers show up and will create some awkward moments for players who have changed their mind over the years
bioware may have oversold their ability to provide a customized ending but at the end theres only so much you can do and the conclusion is stronger than most games offerthe action gameplay is even more finetuned than in mass effect  and isnt far from genre standards like gears of war
powers and special ammo still arent perfectly suited to the  conroller as players can only map three special moves to hotkeys on the controller but its still much better than the first game where only one move could be mapped at a time
this is also handled well in the cooperative multiplayer mode where each calss has three items andor abilities they bring to the fight against waves of opponents
some of the covershooter problems inherent to the genre are here as well but the attention to detail on what makes a cover shooter fun namely varied and organic environs coupled with challenging enemies are present herebioware just couldnt leave well enough alone when it came to exploration however
while the tedious ground exploration levels are completely gone and mining has been drastically simplified much of the solar exploration runs afoul of reapers who come flocking when the player scans an area of a solar system
it makes for annoying games of cat and mouse that dont do a good job of enticing players to explore the furthest corners of the galaxy nor do they make much narrative sensethe graphics are wonderful though similar to mass effect  and the score is the culmination of the themes brought forth throughout
the seams show sometimes in movement that seems off or delayed but its all leaps and bounds ahead of the first game in the trilogy and the sound design from voice acting to the sound effects is all topnotchthere are concerns that ea is influencing biowares decisions as they continue on and it remains to be seen how the company will operate going forward but theres no doubt that mass effect  caps a tremendous trilogy of games even with some of the nigglng problems of exploration and expanding paid dlc
multiplayer has received several free updates with no obvious benefit to ea however and it has continued to expand the variety and challenge in this engaging and addictive modeonce youve beaten the game and you look back at the entire story youll see that bioware did a good job of delivering a dramatic space action experience that will be hard to top that they made a tight and engaging experience that still allowed for players to forge their own relationships and allowed them to move on with the consequences of those actionsincredible game
the ending was a copout
i never thought an entire beautifully written world could be destroyed in  minutes but ill be damnedok the ending was slightly disappointing but it wasnt enough to make me despise this game
this game was an emotional wild ride and had a lot of great story moments
the gameplay was pretty good which should take precedent over the ending
yes the ending is important but this game was the best ending to the mass effect trilogy and i enjoyed it all the way throughthe first game was good
the second game was mediocre and probably one of the most overrated games of all time
the third one isnt even worth writing about
dont waste your time or moneythe story behind this game is greati hadnt played either of the previous mass effect games and was able to follow basically everything in this game
background knowledge as to the previous stories would help but i dont feel its necessarygraphically this is superb and breathtakingmy main issue was that it was too long
i played for hours and hours and just got bored with itid rent for the weekend but not buy unless i was a huge fan of the seriesone of the best games and stories to be played and told
mass effect is a game series not to be missed on any platformi wont get too deep into this review theres plenty of other reviews that go in depth
i have all three games and this is the best up until the ending
the ending isnt terrible but it isnt good either
allinall a great series with a great third game and a weak endingthey dumbed the game down for the shooter enthusiasts which i didnt appreciate
it wasnt like there was a lack of fps on the xbox  and the ending postively sucked
however i couldnt give it  stars because im such a fan of the seriesi have followed mass effect from the beginning and remember playing the first like it was yesterday
putting that game in for the first time and having my first red ring of death before it got to the start menu
the characters the actions i could take the emotional draw and of course the people i could sleep with all made for one fantastic series
i am happy and sad it has come to its end or well shepards storyline at least from what i have heard
the series for me has always been love lots of parts and hate a little of othersanyways i must say i havent finished the game yet but am at the mission right before and decided to do some side missions
i have seen the reviews regarding the ending and i am gonna see if thats whats gonna kill this game for me
from what i have read it almost sounds like an old twilight zone episode or some old horror movie from the fifties or sixties but not really sure yet 
i am sure i am gonna beat it real soon but wanted to get my review out of the way before
the ending from what i have read really doesnt bother me but it does feel like it doesnt sound as epic as the character you have developed
this game is hard to rate for me and probably one of the hardest one i had to really ponderthe games starting set piece is awesome and i said from the start this is gonna be five stars all the way
i intentionally read no reviews or anything since the game came out
this games scope is big but the gameplay feels absolutely small
i was hoping being it was the last in the series everything would feel like that first set piece but unfortunately it never happened in so far as i have gotten
the ending could be the big come back but that has yet to be seen
the game itself felt way to simplified even modding the guns and powers
nothing felt like much except the story which is good enough for me to wanna get through it
there was alot of things i just ran through and others i pondered
the only thing i did find that was great was the emotional draw since everything was coming to a close things needed to end and people needed to get dead
thats right get dead
be it that kid from the beginning or that guy or girl doing that thing no spoilersthe thing i loathed this time was there were so many fire fights that seemed set up like any other third person shooter
if you see cover than odds are youre about to fight
i saw cover saw ammo saw health and that was the set piece quite a bit
almost like a gears of war and less like a mass effect
the rpg elements felt weak and out of all these games i would say the first is my favorite though it was kind of a disaster to organize equipment and all that
the second streamlined it and the third feels completely useless
you merely build up your characters traits and nothing more
i think if i hadnt of built my character i still could of completely beat the game irregardlessits of course is difficult for a developer to one up the previous games but this one just felt rushed at parts
my next problem is how you run into people from previous games which is a small problem but kind of a dumb setup
at first i was like awesome garrus is back but by the time it happened the third or fourth time i was thinking it was ridiculous
surely they could of just had a distress call from an old friend or something like that but instead these people just show up
its like a galaxy and a world of people and you run into these people
its almost like they didnt want to have individual moments so they just put in quick run in moments with these people
some come back for the journey and others dont
one thing that irritated me also was how no matter my decision in some moments i couldnt save certain charactersdecision making is still there but still in my mind didnt seem like it made that much of a difference at times
the first two games you could feel the weight of certain decisions more so than this one
the last games side missions were a lot better than this one as well like one that sticks out is when you land on a planet and everyone is under the influence of this man
nothing like that in this one
maybe it was more for a sense of urgency for part three i dont know
my memory is kind of mixed up about these games since for some reason i thought shepard had a jet pack and some guy had a sword that was a gun too which i am pretty sure is farscape
i cant tell you the exact mission but remember enjoying them a lot more
i am glad the planet scanning from the last game is gone but this one way over simplifies it and its kind of boringdont get me wrong though some decisions are heavy such as a geth or quarian dilemma
that part was one i had to reload my save because i couldnt bear what happens if you choose the wrong one
the characters of course are the draw and those of us who have followed the game from the start have become attached to them
those decisions were the ones that felt heavy which means those that have the fate of squad mates at hand
this game just felt like i could rush the dialogue with some people and not really miss anything
those moments with thane garrus miranda tali or any of the squad were the ones that really mattered
seems like the decision making and the characters were really all that matter in the series or maybe the most important partthe music pieces are phenomenal especially in the moments with that freaking piano music
it really adds to the impact of whats going on and will almost make me teary eyed
i have never cried in a game but there were those moments that you could get the emotional impact deeplyi havent played multiplayer and dons really plan on it but i might give it a try sometime
i dont like the ability to play online affecting the ending or whatever it does
i think it just helps out you totals but i am not really sure
i like multiplayer dont get me wrong but i never wanted it in a mass effect but i guess it doesnt really change anything its just a nice additioni have a hard time with completing certain games and usually procrastinate since i have spent so much time in them
i find myself a little bit depressed when i am done
i think i will feel that way at the end of this one when all is said and done after spending so much time with these characters and finally seeing it over is gonna be tough
i am not an overly sensitive person by any means but this is how my brain works for some reason
be it a good or bad ending i will be sad to see the trilogy overi must say three stars still since the gameplay is ok
but the story is great and its worth playing and seeing it through
i might buy the trilogy later since i dont own any of them but have always rented
for all the bad i might of pointed out the game is overall still very good and i am gonna miss it when its over
this game has been a joy as far as i care and it has its up and downs like most games but its been a good overall experiencei will update this after the ending and see if it changes my rating or notupdate after my complete playthroughspoilers  still not terrible but loses one star for emotional distressoh my goodness i will say i was fine with shepard dying and giving his life for the galaxy
the final set piece of fighting on earth was somewhat boring and not well implemented
fighting just the same enemies that made it feel more like horde mode than anything
out of every gun fight in the game the last earth well london fight was my least favorite until shepard takes on the reaper and everyone gets vaporized
i have no clue if my squad died or not since it doesnt show anything just shepard waking up bloodied with bodies around him
my guess they all just stood at the top of the hill and watched me run like a maniac
i think they could of made it more explosive and exciting and quite a bit more fulfilling
in comparison the endings to the first two were better in my eyes
in fact there were more enjoyable levels in any of the games
the earth level was just a let down
i did enjoy the fact of saying goodbyes and the such to your old pals
i thought my relationship with garrus in this game was almost brotherly and my love interest tali made me wish my character survives it alloh yeah i never played any multiplayer since i merely rented this game didnt want to buy the game pass
most of the time it will give you a trial but nope not this time
i couldnt max out my assets or anything but still almost got a whole green barso when you reach the citadel thats basically it for the action besides the interaction with the illusive man that kind of dragged on until the ending
it was kind of helpful in the advancing of the story but than the illusive man goes into a no one tells me what to do childlike sentence
i chose my choosing and wrapped up the illusive mans story for him and made my way to my final destination after my talk with the crucible
i liked that piano piece of music in this game and the emotion drained out of me
i didnt cry but i could feel the impact
you kind of have a flashback of old friends and i wish they had drawn that out more
i think shepard dying is fine with me but what happens after the mass relays explode gets on my nerves and rubs me the wrong way like single ply toilet paperthe issue i take the most is the fact that as far as my other squad mates there is no full closure
once shepard dies in whichever way you choose you have a brief few minutes of a ending and a crash landing which based upon your stats decides if anyone survives
that was my rub first since how the heck were they all on that ship since i just saw tali and garrus in london but they were on board that ship with joker
either way you go the relays are gone so everyone is basically stranded and you got yourself a dead shepard
unless you get that perfect ending or whatever that rumor is floating around
the one where shepard lives
your crew of whoever i think you were choosing the most during gameplay walks out of the shipworst of all when your friends are coming out of the plane for me anyways out comes joker than tali and than garrus
i was like even if i survived my love interest is now far away anyways
when i saw joker look over at tali with a smile on his face i wanted to destroy him i got edi killed as far as i know
i know what hes up to
i thought i want shepard dead anyways since he wont be with his best friend and gal
now that i know tali isnt a freakish alien faced woman i cared more for her
i can only hope she is pregnant with the now dead shepards kid and hates everyone because of my fatei thought it would be fun if joker comes out and you see like dinosaurs walking around them as if they landed on a prehistoric planet
then garrus comes out and says here we go again
they then all start laughing and its freezes like a eighties show
least that way i could of felt better about the ending
play on my nostalgic childhood to win me overalright seriously i understand what all the fuss on the endings is about now and it really didnt feel like justice to a game thats consumed so many people
engrossed in a world and then its over relatively fast and the sense of closure disappears
seems to me the ending would be the most delicate part of the series that would of taken a good amount of time to get through
i was looking forward to this after shepards fate type moment but never got it
it almost feels like you made choices in every game but in the end they really dont matter
the decisions i have made from the first game no longer mattered
in conclusion i will go half and half on the ending
love and hate
teenager and old people
dogs and cats
me and my neighbor who hates meif youre a completionist like me whose gone all nerd and bought the guidebook so you wont miss one thing on each planet then youre probably in for about  hours of gameplay
about  of them are wonderful full of the stellar storytelling and voice acting were used to from the me series
then the th hr strikes and things take a downhill turn very quickly
if youre good enough to have avoided spoilers to this point i wont be the one to ruin it for you but needless to say its an ending of the epicfailure sort that will be remembered as a bad taste in the mouth of gamers everywhere for a long long timewhy do i give it  stars if the ending was so badmost of the rest of the game was decent
i enjoyed the majority of the side missions
the planet scanning thing was much less painful than its predecessors
the music was still lovely
theres much to like about this gameconclusion if you loved the first two see the story to the endi highly recommend playing the entire trilogy from beginning to end
very few games succeed in story character development and actionadventure to the level that bioware has achieved with mass effect   and   i know many players are less than satisfied with the ending of me but i was completely fine with it
i also recommend downloading as many of the dlcs as possible for each game  for me it is a must especially the extended cut which expands upon the ending and brings a bit more clarity to consequences of your final choices
enjoy the  hrs of gameplayits so hard to rate this game because it is awesome until the last like  minutes then it goes completely downhillwithout spoiling it i am going to say this your choices mean absolutely nothing which totally flies against the whole point of the mass effect experience
if your shepard is an angel or complete douchebag it doesnt matter you get the same three choices at the end of the game no matter what
additional complaints are as follows if you have a character that you made from me  and imported to two then youll love the fact that you cannot import that same face into three
apparently the geniuses who made this game took into account the fact that they had to make it compatible with me with respect to transferring your face but overlooked that some real fans such as myself have had a character that they made all the way from me and did not make faces of me compatible
as such you have to make your face all over again
what happened to the thirdneutralmiddle option
me and me usually had three possible choices a paragon a renegade and then a middle ground which was always my favorite cause im a middlenonextremes kind of guy
the middle option is gone
every choice is either renegade or paragon which is absolutely ridiculous
the ninja character from cerberus is just such a walking cliche i forget his name
you can tell he was also made to cater to this generation of gamers who like overthetop martial arts kind of characters that do things you would never see in real combat
one of the cool things about me and  was that it was more of a realistic rendition of the future where people used guns and no one used swords like in star wars which is just absurd i want to see someone go to iraq with just a sword and see how long they last
me went against this more realistic combat by making this clown of a characterso there you have it awesome gameplay and great story right up until the end
however the ending is so bad that i am afraid it destroys the entire franchiselike many others i loved the game until the endings
ive played and enjoyed me and me for years and would recommend both
me had a lot of good points graphics game play some of the characters were outstanding jack was amazing having my team from me  show up and having characters from me involved was enjoyable
then you come to the possible endings and all are depressingone play though works maybe two but its not a game you want if you enjoy a lot of replaying or want some kind of we beat the evil and survived with some of our friends and loved one to build a future
unless you like depressing think twice
there is very little hope in this game
maybe there will be a broken steel in the future but until then dont be surprised if you only play it once or twice and are depressed for some time afterthere are other small problems that will bother some and the reviews give those but the lack of a hopeful future is what takes it down for methis is an update to my review
bw did a few things to try and fix the problem which for me did not help enough to play all of my carryover shepards from the previous games though there are others who found the ec very helpfulbut if you have never played the other  games me works pretty good
its been over a year and i just played the game as if i had never seen me or   its not my shepard its theirs and ive enjoyed the game
not really enough to replay it because the choices dont change but it is much better as a single game and not the ending of a trilogy
imoi must say i was so looking forward to this game after enjoying the previous twoespecially the first gamei dont care to much about combat as i prefer the story and making different decisions that change things and i like running around exploringtalking to people and enjoying the viewwhen i first heard this game was going to feature multiplayer i wasnt happybut then heard that the last game in the trilogy would be a combination of the first two so decided to buy it and see for myselfwell the game isnt bad at times and a few missions are quite goodbut seams smaller in scope than the previous two and less fulfilling than the first gamei hate how there are less places to visit and planets to explorebut the dialogue seems less than before and the graphics are pretty bad at timesbut its the fact that your decisions make no difference to what happens so it nolonger matters what you dothen there is that awfully stupid ending that gave me no closer at all and made no sense also i hate the sexual innuendoes and come ons which can be hard to avoid i think bioware has changed the game so much to appeal to its new target audience the fps crowd and pubescent teenagers they are dismissing its loyal fans of the past by making a more action orientated game rather than a pure rpgpersonally i think they should at least fix this game with a different ending add more dialogue optionsallow you to re recruit a few former allies and to see more returning npcsalso please bring back a ground vehicle and more missionsthis game is very short and was over before i knew itpersonally i think had they not included the multiplayer element or the kinect component they would have had more time to finnish it offinstead they released a game that isnt really mass effect enough and i hope they do something about rectifying itive read through almost all of the reviews here
thank you all for the feedback
i dont want to play this game anymore
im near the end now and based on what everyone is saying about the ending its all too grim for me
i feel like ive invested emotionally in this game over several years and that was so obviously intentional by the game design of the customizable lead character and i dont want to go through a depressing end to a series
hallucination or not im not in the mood to deal with another xena ending
ill just have to stop where i am and create my own ending in my headthis final installment puts you on a desperate inexorable path towards total destruction
the war is hell theme runs deep throughout the story and stays that way until the bitter end
this isnt about reclaiming the galaxy  it is about sailing through space with other guys im flattered kaiden and mr bus driver but no thanks
all things considered i believe that the story played out nicely
lifedeath is about your choices and actions in the face of overwhelming odds
being a soldier in me was never about starting a family and settling down
it was about staring death in the eye and going where others feared to treadthe ambiguity of it all i think speaks to the narrative of the entire me series
the gameplay is amazing simply amazing
the themes touched on builds the characters in effective ways
the conversation with the downed reaper is one of my favorite moment in a video game
i felt like the character development in me was stronger but shepherd as a character does a significant amount of changing throughout this game
while still not a complete grey area in the morality category  the question of choice is explored in dialogue and in gameplay
so while this game does not have as many character home runs miranda jack grunt thane vs javik edi liara  ashley  the development in shepherd and the gameplay picks up that slack
i feel like the negative comments result from a fundamental misunderstanding about this story and about what this game is
could they have thrown all their weight to artistic integrity
sure but they did not totally do it and there are some faultyovercommercialized elements to the game
as a game and as a conclusion to the series me is brilliant
me has officially become my favorite game trilogy
my hope is that this game will become a cannon to other games that come after it  even as mainstream as it has become
and to all the reviews which write off the ending as disappointing at best well there is at least one gamer who loves the ending
granted i truly understand the concerns about the plot holes lack of true choice weak introduction of new bad guy character character breakdowns and unsatisfactory revelationending
well it does kind of make me mad  my hope is that the dlcs will bring something better to the table
 stars  ending took away one sorry i guess i am just like everyone elsesome bad in this games is the finish i expect some more like the last games of mass effect but is a good gamejust wanted to add this link
interesting discussion and well worth the listen
also head over to fanfictionnet for closure
enjoy  okay so i slept on it and woke with the same empty gut feeling i had last night
the ending of me was just plain bad story telling
cheap and lazy story telling
they robbed us of a story ending which we had been building for years
every single one of us invested time emotion and identity into our shepard
we were robbed
whether or not shepard had a romantic happy ending with liaratali or spent the rest of his days in a bar with garrus and grunt picking fights and telling war stories should have been our choice
we worked for it but we didnt get our payoffso to add more review to my rant here graphics i thought my xbox was failing
we are well past excusing poor graphics
that was just messy
story line me warned us that our decisions would play out in me
it just doesnt happen
instead we get some cobbled together plot line
i got the feeling as the credits rolled that the writers had run out of coffee it was midnight and one of them said geez my wife is gonna kill me if i dont get home
so they jumped the shark and the loyal fans got crap
you can only say everyone is getting wiped out so many times before it becomes meaningless filler
there really was no way for anyone to beat the reapers
so in order to make a credible conclusion someone or something should have stepped in to save us
that would have given ea a plot point for continuing the series in another form
a good story has a beginning a middle and an end
we have no ending
come to think of it the ending completely eliminates the hero journey storyline
which was working until the ending of me and i am not happy
but apparently it can be made right
i purposefully avoided reading anything about the outcome or the game play
but now i know i can fix iton the other hand i enjoyed the game very much
i liked the fighting and the weapons upgrades
not having to mine planets anymore was a much appreciated touch
the dialogue was both hilarious and heartbreaking
ive been a gamer for many years now
ive been master chief a drop ship trooper cheered my team on as nobel  i raid in world of warcraft played all the fear
games and i just finished skyrim
you get the picture
but i have never ever played a video game which had me on the edge of my seat with tears dripping down my cheeks or clutching the controller with an idiot grin plastered on my face watching a cut sceneso purchase the game and sit down for a nice immersive gamespoiler alertyou have been warnedthe dog was lameway too many characters died
why
lazy story tellingwhy were some of the minor characters so simply drawn
traynor was practically an anime drawing and kelly chambers looked almost nothing like she did in me
even miranda looked washed out
i wonder whyi love this mass effect chapter
 hour game for those who likes to play  hours a day
have a lot of alternative missions that give your extra gaming time and relax or just for walk aroundso lets be frank ea is the devilsetting that aside lets look at the game itself
i love the mass effect story its a rich and vibrant universe that stands out in the sci fi genre
ea s on it a little bit in the later games but again im setting that aside
im going to rate the game on certain aspects as a shooter  very generic third person shooter well made but brings nothing worth mentioning to the table other than exploding heads with headshots as an rpg hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha they basically just put an rpg skin on a shooter but it still has some of the basic clothes youd expect an rpg to wear support casters tanks damage dealers etc as a game if you dont buy the dlc story is pretty good with a s ending and youre about as satisfied as masterbating to a tomato if you got all the dlc i honestly would have paid  for the citadel dlc and javek alone and  buck for the rest of this gameif youve been playing me the whole way through citadel is what you really care aboutgod i hope ea doesnt read that cause then the next game they release will just be that by itselfoverall ill give it  stars mediocre rpg mechanically sound shooter and it continued a universe that ive loved for yearsi feel sad that this game out of almost  reviews so far has an average  star rating
people are entitled to their opinions but i feel that bioware is such an awesome company and deserves more credit
but onto my own reviewstoryline i found it very interestingit was very intense very emotional and very intriguing
and to address the endingi didnt love it but only because it was sad
and i cant insult something just because it makes me sad anyway
i cant get into it and this isnt a debate site but i was still okay with the endings and i was interested in the story the whole time
i liked the new characters enjoyed seeing the old
i wish there had been more romantic interactions between my character and her lover but its not up to memusic oh man what a treat
the music was so great and thrilling
i would love to have a soundtrack of this gamemultiplayer i find it very fun
in order to get better characters and guns you have to play enough games to buy recruitveteranspectre packs which may or may not contain something new and good
its repetitive doing the same type of mission over and over just with different enemies or maps but i like it a lot anyway
its like zombies in cod where you really have to stay alive as not to burden your team matesgraphics i have been spoiled by cod games halo reach and skyrim so no the graphics arent as good as those
however it is still a stunning beautiful gamereplayability definitely will play this a few times to make different choicessummary this is a great game
its fun its interesting its emotional and very well done
i really hope people wont hate the entire series just because of the endingfor background ive been playing bioware rpgs ever since baldurs gate i and ii on the pc
i have loved a lot of games with the bioware label except for knights of the old republic ii and dragon age ii
goodcombat the fps portion has gotten better again
its even closer stuff like gears of war now which is a good thingpast consequences almost everything youve done in the past  games has consequences in mass effect  beyond just getting a stupid email
for example a certain government official will be assassinated unless you saved at least one of two characters in the past games
there are a lot more examples
im glad they listened on this point
playing the past  mass effects has value
i dont know of any other game series that does this
this is a great achievement
more on this in the bad section
on a related note if you bought the dlc that replaces mass effect  youre still missing out
that dlc only accounts for major decisions
this only sucks if youre a ps ownerinventory they basically made inventory management way better without throwing it out like they did in mass effect story as everyone else has already said the games story up until the end is both interesting and engaging with a lot of cameos from past decisions as well a good variety
more on this in the bad sectionloading time one of the major reasons they changed the layout of the citadel and the normandy is to make loading faster
compared to the first and even nd mass effect loading times are just awesome
it is just greatreplayability not even counting the so so multiplayer addon this game makes the entire mass effect series replayable
a lot of decisions youve made in the games even from the st one matter and they make subtle changes to the story
there are so many changes and variants that i dont feel a single player can hit all of them on even  complete play throughs
more on this in the bad sectionbugs for  this game is nearly bug free compared to other releases like fallout games
more on this in the bad section
badpast consequences or lack of there are few major decisions that didnt seem to have an effect on mass effect s world
whoever you chose as the human representative for the citadel council will probably not reflect who that person is in mass effect  unless you were a renegade in mass effect 
its a minor annoyance but i think most people can get over it
my guess for this is because there wasnt a mass effect  for ps and it would add cost to making the game as well as story complexity
also depending on who you ultimately chose as a love interest you may or may not feel cheated hint if its not a main character in mass effect  youre probably not going to be happy once you see what they did for the main characters
 spoiler start regardless with how you feel about cerberus from mass effect  youll be fighting them in mass effect  which is a little stupid to me especially if you play as a renegade
as a renegade everything cerberus does makes total sense
of course i realize that everyone has budget
it would be nice to see dlc that lets you side with cerberus
i will pay as much as what rockstar charged for their gta iv dlc maybe even more to see this happen spoiler end conversations i really hated the conversations with kasumi and zaeed in mass effect  where they never entered a conversation cut scene
they added even more of these in mass effect  its just horrible
in a lot of cases this involves picking up new missions
so instead of talking to people shepard just eavesdrops on conversations like a weirdo creeper to acquire a minor mission
this is one of the most stupid decisions made that just cheapens the gamestory yes this is about the ending
what people like mass effect s director casey hudson and head writer mac walters have chosen to forget is that mass effect is not a movie or an art house game like braid
mass effect is a world that gives mainstream players choices that greatly affect that world
no one beside ebert cares about metaphor and symbolism in a game that has the feel of star wars or lord of the rings
bioware is not rockstar games and changing direction was just stupid
without any spoilers the ending essentially gives you several bad variants of the same choice which doesnt seem to be based on anything youve done so far
the explanation doesnt even make any sense unless you bend the words
to add insult to injury they just show the same cinematic albeit in different colored explosions
the worse part is that the endings greatly change the universe of mass effect
they dont even give you a summary conclusion like fallout new vegas or biowares baldurs gate series
they would have gotten away with a few paragraphs of a narrated post conclusion summary before
now theyre going to have to come up with something way better to placate a lot of angry people
i would say the only people who are not either annoyed or disappointed with the ending are people who just picked up the mass effect series at its rd installment and people who have some personal or professional connection to the developers and ea for obvious reasons spoiler start in my opinion i dont understand why one of the last choices is essentially what cerberus was fighting for
why not join them from the beginning then instead of fighting them at every turn
its just bad writing
there really should only be two choicesalso as per the reaper god childs explanation for why they wipe out civilizations it only makes sense if the reapers were the original creators of advanced organic life since the created will always eventually rebel against their creators
other than that its stupid
robots will always eventually rebel against and exterminate their their slave master organic creators so to keep this from happening we the older more powerful robots will wipe out their slave master organic creators for them
this is just retarded spoiler end my guess as to why the ending sucked is because they chose to work on an included multiplayer game instead and they just ran out of both time money and disc space
im pretty sure that they were dead set on keeping it limited to two dvds max
according to rumor this was something that the head director and head writer came up by themselves without any input what so ever from the rest of the writing team
my guess is that since they missed the last xmas deadline and they were already way over budget they just came up with this crap to get the game to release
this game would have been better if they kept developing it for a fall  releaseive heard apologists from various game publications complain about mass effect fans sense of entitlement
ill tell you why mass effect fans should feel entitled
not only have they spent s of hours through all  games but they have also spent approximately  for each of the past  games  dlc
thats about  for the past two mass effects and dlc   for the third mass effect and dlc
this is why people feel both entitled and angrynickel and dimeing i dont feel that anyone should have been charged for day one dlc when its pretty apparently that it was originally slated to have been part of the game
just charge more upfront at the very least
i also dont feel that customers should be charged for a dlc to fix the ending
that being said itll probably be like mass effect  where eventually there will be  or more worth of new dlc excluding the weapon and item packs
its not our fault someone decided to lose focus on the single player campaign for a so so multiplayer component
that being said as in previous installments mass effect  is only a complete game when you buy all the dlcbugs some missions are buggy and they cant be completed
however the game is relatively bug free compared to fallout new vegas or even fallout  mass effect  is very playable
it is still annoying not being able to complete some missions thoughreplayability the ending kills replayability
it makes people ask whats the point
miscmultiplayer is decent but i dont think its as good as the gears of war series
they should have spent more money and time on the single player experience
i strongly feel this is the real reason that the single player game suffered including its storyline
the multiplayer component should not have been included with the main game
it should have been sold and shipped separately
the writers were probably forced to work around this issue hence the crappy ending
ea rushed mass effect  team
you would think they would learn after dragon age  of course i know why they put in multiplayer
they wanted to discourage both used game sales as well as pirating
conclusionif you can wait i would wait until this game drops to  and bug fixes and story fixing dlc is released
ideally id just wait until all the dlc is released and the game drops to  youll still be spending close to  at that point but you wont be frustratedsince bioware the company and studio are both defunct and the name just represents a sticker or using eas speak a label that any ea studio can tack onto their games this is probably the last game with the bioware sticker that ill be buying
im just glad that they didnt completely dragon age d or more accurately ead the mass effect series yet
i dont feel that any of this stuff would be happening if biowares founders didnt sell out to ea or another big publisher like ubisoft or activision
i dont blame them though the money was probably pretty good
i just hope once the gold handcuffs are off that the bioware founders and other former bioware members jump ship and form a new studio that doesnt have to cater to public quarterly earnings pressureswhile the first game was expansive and buggy the second game streamlined the process a bit while still keeping plenty of side quests and a sense of adventure
this time out the game starts off promisingly with the invasion of earth but is streamlined to the point where the only thing thats left is the combat
and believe me towards the end of the game it becomes tiresome and repetitive
i eventually switched to the easiest setting just so i could go ahead and finish the game
a real letdownits pretty sad when you rate a game  star just cause you didnt like the ending and ruining it for other people who come here to see reviews to see if they should get the gameits childish and immatureif you enjoyed mass effect  you will more than likely enjoy this one to
the game has improved shooting in it and if you enjoyed the storyline you will enjoy this to
the ending isnt amazing but you shouldnt let  mins
of the game ruin it for youwriting a review of mass effect  is like writing an opinion on abortion
the emotions run extremely high with this game
and that in and of itself indicates how much people care about the characters and plotsive been reviewing video games since the days of adventure and zork and of course there have been many atrocious games along the way
people who play atrocious games tend to be fairly blase about it
yes it sucks
move on
however with mass effect  it is an entirely different set of emotion
the emotions here are more along the lines of i adored my character
i invested hundreds of hours into carefully crafting his life his moral choices and the people he fell in love with
and then this
i think its important to realize how powerful this situation is
only a mere ten years ago people would argue that video games could not capture the emotion
they would argue that there was no way to connect with a video game
we have proven here in  that absolutely a video game can be far more immersive than a movie or a novel
with a video game you become invested in the story you help craft the path and you emotionally connect with the charactersthink of all the areas that mass effect  opened horizons
it offered heterosexual and homosexual relationships and most people didnt blink an eye
it offered a range of ethnicities and hardly a word was spoke about it
moral choices were presented and people made their decisions
people caredso i think it absolutely should then be expected that these years of investment these weeks of time and emotion and energy should have a payoff at the end
yes gamers paid the x amount for the game  but that is trivial compared with the investment of their time and energy
they expect after all of that that what they did matteredand in the end it didntthe summation of the game  as undoubtedly the vast majority of gamers know by now  is completely independent of what the gamer chose to do
relationship choices didnt matter
alliance choices didnt matter
morals good or bad or ugly didnt matter
the game makers simply pulled with a razor and ended the storythere are some gamers who posit that this shouldnt matter
oh well
it was a noble end
we should be satisfiedbut again this is not about a movie we watched for  minutes while munching popcorn
it was an investment
if you were in a five year relationship with a partner where you lived with them cared for them and made a focused effort to make things work would you be content with a five minute razorblade slicing off of the relationship
how would that ever be considered adequate
and once your partner had done that to you would you say to yourself oh well they were nice to me beforeabsolutely i feel strongly that the way one closes a relationship is one of the most important powerful things a person in a relationship can do
i feel bioware failed in this act  and by doing so they tainted all that came beforeask any woman or man who has been through a nasty divorce what they remember
is it the few years of joy  or is it the way they were treated at the endfor those who didnt mind the ending at all im not sure what to say
if someone was in a five year marriage and they dont really mind that their partner cheated on them nastily and laughed as they ran off with the money  what does that say about the persons emotional investment in that relationshipi purchased this game with my own funds for the purpose of doing this reviewsome have totally dismissed the entire mass effect trilogy because of the bad ending of me  but i will not
me and me are just too good to commit that crime
i did discover that the online multiplayer in me  was better than i expected so i will do more of that to help me forget about the unsatisfying conclusion to the best game series ever
it will be interesting to see what they will do for a downloadable content after all of the intense fan pressure to fix that dreadful endingthere are lots of angry fans here over the ending of an excellent game
sure the game had a few minor issues like gaps in the story that were left unanswered but the journey from a to z was immersive emotional and most of all funseriously who didnt see the game ending like this
from the moment joker salutes you near the end i knew for sure
anyone who read the books could probably predict this ending as well
this is not a disney movie where you get the girl and live happily ever after
the only thing that got to me is the fact that my previous decisions seemed to have no impact other than to open up a few more dialog wheels
overall great game that missed its core fanbase wishes
updatemultiplayer i had low expectations about this
boy was i surprised
i actually got hooked after saying what a waste of time it would be
there are rarely any framerate issues and the coop is quite competitivethe reward packages you can buy with the credits you earn can have you saying just one more match for hours
my only real complaint are the people who rage quit a match because they dont get enough killsyoull only get better by leveling your overall rank and by getting better equipment
quitting a match midway through gets you nothinganother great mass effect game
full of atmosphere and impeccably written
this one seems to be the pinnacle of the three
the control system is even tighter than the improvements they made in  it looks great and the voice acting is perfect
if you liked the first two dont let the negative reviews put you off this is a great gamethe fact that this many people are mad about the ending is a tribute to this games greatness
yes the ending came out of no where but this is more than likley the best trilogy ever
my biggest pet peeve is no option at the ending and above all joker gets blown up flying away from battle
joker would never leave shepard everim going to get it out of the way i am trying to rate this game on its own merits not in direct comparison to the value of the other  or the endings in dragon age or how i feel about multiplayer games or day  dlc
i avoided as many spoilers as i could going in and i did enjoy playing itpresentation this game could have used an insert for the kinect commands and control scheme at the very leastif not a full instruction book to explain the multiplayer functions and so forth
not including one except on disc was lazy
boo
packaging was nicedisk swapping annoyingbut a neccesary evil
compared to the minimal swaps last time around i got a little suprised by the more frequent swaps this time
i handwaved it off since there wasnt really a clear transition point in this gamecontrol play control felt decent enough
mostly the same scheme from me with a few tweaks for cover melee combat and so forth
fairly intuitivegraphics and sound are overall pretty strong
i had some dialogue buried under the ambients a few timesregardless of sound settingsmultiplayer decentbut nothing really amazing horde mode with some objectives every few waves
i can see it being played hard for launchand then just tapering off
as an optional mode it doesnt really distract or damage the solo play in my opinion
i do find the different mechanic for weapon switching for example slightly annoying since mp characters dont get a pause wheelstory overall the story does not feel as plotted as the earlier incarnations
while this is a common trait in trilogies me does stumble a few times with some head scratching choices and ramifications like my paragon choice of stopping a companion by immediately killing himherit on the spot or the way the narrative cheats around a particular choice from the earlier game
the rachni queen for example i killed her way back in me and exterminated the racebut the rachni are now included due to a false queen breeder and had i spared them
same thing happens anyways
it feels like a deliberate backdoor instead of giving me something different for my choicesand a lot like how da played out
contrasting these annoyances are some of the most impactive rp moments in a long time ie
mordin on tuchanka
sowhile overall i liked itbut it wasnt the mostly seamless meme transition and it focused so much on the big epic story that it was very easy to lose the overall momentum of the characters especially when the previous game was very tightly plotted and character driven
about  vocal people on the internet hate the endings for thematicstyle or continuity reasons i liked minebut i do wish there were more direct differences between the  or so endings and a little less subtle nuance
this is the closing chapter all bets should be offkinect functionality kinect voice commands were more accurate than in halo anniversary however in areas with mass combat and a lot of ambient noise like the final rush on earthsometimes my surround sound would drown out my voice commands
a nonissue when i used my stereo headphones but still something to consider even with a tv top mounted kinect and a below tv stereo barachievements are simple enough with none of the goodies the first game gave you like ingame perks or gamerpics but there are  avatar awards that are easily gainedoverall i found it a good game that i enjoyed even if its not my personal favorite of the run
i dont know realistically if anything was going to surpass the standard me put out there for me but it didnt feel like the cash grab dragon age  did
a good effort that didnt always hit the mark with me but not the blatant crap i kept hearing about  weeks before the game launchedive played through and beat both me and me and could not wait to get my hands on this gamebioware has adjusted things once again in terms of other planet visiting which was easily the biggest drag in me and im thankful its been changedthe story is epic and the characters are memorablei had no issues with importing my previous charactersthe multiplayer may not be as great as games like gow but it really does add a bit of a changeup and funsorry for the short review but everyone has covered this so wellbuy it and dont regret itmass effect  revieworiginally posted march   reposted august  
okay so there are more than enough reviews on here that complain about the ending
i wont do that much and will just give you the nittygrittymillionsyearold machine gods called the reapers wipe out advanced life in the galaxy every fifty millennia and our time is due
its up to commander shepard and his team of spacefaring soldiers to put an end to a millionsyearold cycle of death and destruction once and for all
this will mean uniting entire civilizations and putting to end hundredsyearlong wars in order to bring about the intergalactic unity needed to take out such an unimaginable threat
can shepard pull it offpros fantastic story up until the ending emotion provoking characters characters move around the normandy and interact and engage with other teammates more often excellent dialogue along with many funny characters and jokes engaging gameplay expanded rpg elements expanded weapons and customization expanded military class elements more detailed side missions moneycredits is abundant enough where you can get everything you need without ever feeling like youre always poor planet scanning was cut back to be less boring and not slow down the story as much explore many alien homeworlds new character models like female krogan and salarianscons grenadesgrenades are the biggest hinderance in this game
your own do absolutely nothing while enemies will cause the most deaths of you
and unlike every other shooter game you cannot pick up grenades and throw them back
you must move out the way or die
and moving out the blast radius will likely put you in the crossfire of enemies allowing you to die just as easily
essentially its either death by grenade or death by gunfire
the grenade spam is so annoying the cover system is obtrusivewhenever youre trying to dodge out of a grenades way youll either take cover on something while still being in the blast radius causing you to die or be unable to free yourself from cover at all until its too late
when you need cover it rarely works efficently
the not being able to throw back grenades problem would make this an otherwise minor issue terrain issuesbumpy terrain is constantly getting in the way causing you to die needlessly or not hop over obstacles
especially when you need to dodge out the way or avoid a grenade blast
this is especially noticible on the london missions towards the end because the battlefield is damaged you cant configure your squads powers unless you begin a missionitd be nice to just be able to do this on the normandy instead of having to wait until the next mission just to upgrade edi or garrus or give them new weapon mods graphical glitchesespecially noticable with characters on the excerberus scientists mission
jacob will usually be talking to an invisible squadmate character importer is defective
your imported shepard wont look the way they used to before at all no more neutral options in dialogues
only paragon friendly and renegade aggressive choices the game is kind of short
itll take about  hours total to complete as oppossed to the usual  hours itd take to beat a game this size
theres also less side missions involving actual locations and battlefields the ingame journal which keeps track of your mission progress is muddled and confusing
also why couldnt the war assets just be in your pause menu no more stations to explore besides the citadel
they give you six floors on it which is a plus but its still lame some side objectives are glitched or just executed badlythis makes it very possible to not be able to complete the goals needed for them
such as talking to someone on the citadel who needs you to get something from a planet you just came from and will no longer be able to access again jessica chobots bad voice acting of diana allersi personally dont think shes that bad but it is pretty nailsonachalkboard compared to everyone elses superior voicework none of the character or major story choices from the past games matter muchthey just result to a number on the war assets screen
many characters from the past you never even get to see again
so much for them literally fighting by your side against the reapers
they just made it all feel so pointless somewhat subjective the game pretty much has little replay value
maybe this is because its the final installment or maybe its because of the ending but there just is hardly any reason to replay it after beating it somewhat subjective the soldier class has been signifcantly downgraded making them the weakest class because they no longer have any advantages over anyone else
actually more like every other class has been upgraded to the point where the soldier no longer has any actual advantages at all the requirement to do multiplayer online in order to get  game completion
this is just bs the ending of coursethe one major thing which in manys eyes has completely destroyed not only the game but the entire franchise
i didnt hate the endings as much as everyone else and just kind of assumed dlc would explain the rest of it since thats the unfortunate path it seems greedy game companies are going nowadays anyway
though now that the dlc is out the endings are somehow now worse because they really didnt add much onto the end
and if you dont have an online account youre stuck with the original endings
and they it more like it really suck
 indoctrination theory wouldve been so much better
they wouldnt have even had to change that much in my view
just made some elements like the final characters you see at the end reaper hallucinations and the rest couldve still been real
but i digress
neither pro or con difficulity has been significantly weakened
its gone down a peg for each one
insanity is now as hard as the old hardcore
if not for the annoying enemy grenades insanity wouldnt be hard at all the reapers kind of ruin galaxy exploration
theyre pretty annoying but i guess it makes sense
they also hardly feel threatening at all as all that happens if they catch you is you restart
i almost feel like there shouldve been something youd have to do to escape their pursuit like a laserdodging spacefight in order to avoid being killed or getting the normandy damaged or something health has been seriously weakened making it a lot easier to die than in me
i guess some will take that as a challenge but on insanity difficulity its pretty hindering theres now multiplayer in the game which has you playing as other soldiers and races in the galaxy trying to defeat the reapers in their own stories
though i like the idea of showing how shepard isnt the only heroic soldier in a galaxy of a trillion lives the whole concept is a bit too little too late and felt really unnecessary
mass effect wouldve been just as good of a series had multiplayer never existed
probably better considering they try to make you do multiplayer to get the best possible ending
overallworth renting
beyond a doubt worth playing
but after the second london mission and last part of the game it should probably be stopped to save yourself from dissapointment
its a fun game
kinda short
still  perfect
if only not for that ending i give the game overall  stars and  in gameplay
the ending along with all the other faults i mentioned definitely bring it down from what truly couldve been a perfect game and unforgettable wrapup to the greatest scifi series since star warsjust finished  minutes ago
i didnt think it was possible
i didnt want to believe it
im dumbfounded
the last ten minutes ruined this series for me totally and completely
worst writing ive ever seen in a game
if you buy this dont play the last ten minutes
ive been a hard core fan since day  with this series now im ready to wash my hands of it
drew karpyshyn left and everything fell apart
the writing level is that of a brain dead clam
it made no sense and left me ill with regret
unless bioware ea corrects this and i have no idea how i will never buy another product with their names on it again
the gameplay and multiplayer is amazing  for everything but the last  minutes and cheeping out on talis face
but the ending ruins it all
you dont believe me
thats ok i wouldnt believe me either
you have to see this horror yourself to believe itthis review contains spoilers so if you are sensitive stop reading now
many people are complaining about the ending of mass effect  but i do not see the problem
some people are complaining about the fact that shepard dies
so what he dies at the end
the public doesnt decide the ending to games movies books or television
the developers make that decision as they should being that its their product
other people are complaining that they didnt understand the ending or didnt get the good ending where shepard lives
i dont know how many endings there are but here is the ending that i got after playing the game for  hours completing every priority and side mission retrieving every war asset and having every conversation in single player only no multiplayer
i also played and ported mass effect    at the end of mass effect  you meet the catalyst in the form of a ghostly child
the child explains why the reapers exist but not who exactly created the reapers
you are given three choices and you are told that you will die upon making your choice
the choices are you may chose to destroy the reapers but if you allowed the geth to live they will also be destroyed along with edi and any other synthetics
this will be evident when joker crash lands on the planet and edi does not exit the normandy you may chose to take control of the reapers allowing their existence and any other synthetics to continue
this will be evident when joker crash lands on the planet and edi exits the normandy you may chose to bring about the final stage of human evolution by merging synthetics and organics
this will be evident when joker crash lands on the planet and he edi and another character exit the ship with signs of synthetics mixed in with their organics such as glowing eyes and circuitry running through their skinbottom line is shepard dies no matter the choice but he is given the power by the catalyst to chose how life in general will continue
a fitting end to a great seriesthere were a few bugs like the dekunna mission in the minos wasteland that never happened
the mission was in the journal and you were supposed to help save the elcor but that mission just never showed up
you could never land on the planet and when you went back to the citadel to talk to the elcor that gave you the mission in the first place the mission is complete
this is something that should have been caught by the developers since it is so obvious
the minos wasteland also kept blinking as if there was a mission to be done
other bugs were not being able to get into and out of cover
this was very frustrating at times
all in all i enjoyed the entire game including the endings
i was not confused and i dont understand others confusionmass effect  should not be given poor reviews solely because some individuals did not like the ending
the game should be rated on overall performance not just the ending which i had no problem withits ridiculous how many poor ratings this game is getting from angry bitter people who let a cryptic ending spoil the entire mass effect universe for them
i wont cover the technical stuff in this review but i will say that this is the richest game ive ever played in my life which is saying a lot
rich in fun gameplay rich in characters in story and in emotion
its universe is so wellrealized beautifully drawn and complex every time i play it i truly get invested in this living breathing world
i know the way im wording it probably sounds sappy but i cant help but be impressed by biowares intelligent writing and designwhich brings me to the ending
at firstviewing the ending seems like a jarring juxtaposition from the great writing and logic were so used to from the series
it feels like a cheap way out
but if you think about everything in this game and the ones before if you really look for the clues and connect the dots youll realize how clever and disturbing the ending really is
i wont be able to explain it as well as others can so do yourself a huge favor and watch the youtube video mass effect   shepards indoctrination new but only once youve finished the game or have seen the ending
also consider googling the article why i liked the mass effect  ending eventually on gameseyeview
ignore the extreme horrible ratings
if youre outraged by the ending take the time to explore its meaning rather than condemning the game and its hardworking developerwhile not completely perfect technically its an amazing ride with a hell of a story and fastpaced gameplay accompanied by genuine wellwritten characters and topnotch voice acting from all involvedthe mass effect trilogy has got to be one of the best game series i have ever played
the depth of each game is incredible and mass effect  doesnt disappointbefore you decide against this because of the so called crappy ending here me outbioware released an extended cut ending for this game that fills in the gaps that were left in the original ending
it clears up so much and makes the ending much better and majorly worth the free  gigs of a downloadif you do decide on getting this game there are so many great aspects you will enjoygreat easy to figure out combatamazing rpg style of game playgreat character design and depthparagonrenegade options in the game good and bad optionsfantastic environmental designgreat soundtracki know some folks had complaints about the ending but really it didnt bother me at all
i love how everything leading through the series i become so invested in all of the characters their worlds and just everything
this game and the series does something special and really should be celebrated
definitely something that needs to be played but you should play all  in order to get the best experiencesighi dont think iv ever been so existentially depressed over the finale of a story prior to this
i was so enthralled so happy so hopeful that when it all came crashing down around my ears i nearly punted my controller down a hallway and slunk off to the darkest corner of home
how did it all go so wrongalright alright it may help if i give an analysis of the positive aspects of mass effect  its meteoric rise before going into its hideous shrieking fallwell after  years and three titles the mass effect trilogy reached what i can only describe as a fitting compromise in terms of its combat
evenly blending the gears of war styled cover shooting of me with the more tactical power based combat of me and oh my god does it work beautifully
the combat is smooth challenging customizable fluid and very strategic
the combat is just a blast to play through and its here in spades
couple the stylistic improvements with vastly improved ai generous cover and easily learned controls and you have the best combat engine in the entire seriesthen of course theres the customization
upon the release of mass effect  many folks decried that entry for cutting down the rpg aspects even though the rp in rpg emphasizes roleplaying not leveling up i dont care what final fantasy says and when looking back on the weapons and levelup system me was a bit stripped down
in me the weapon mods are back and while theyre more limited than they were in the first game you still get the feeling that you making each weapon your own
and the leveling implemented here is the best the trilogy has seen fully allowing total customization over your powers and forcing you to make tactical decisions over where you put your pointsexploration is back as well at least to an extent as the world is overall much bigger than in me
its still smaller than in me but to be honest i wasnt even expecting the increase whatsoever
you get a real sense of scope for galaxy here and the new worlds you get to touch down on are varied and uniqueand then theres the story
up until the ending this is the best storyline in the entire trilogy featuring some of the best writing bioware has ever done
the sense of scale the raw emotion the dialogue the characters the music the direction every single aspect of interactive storytelling is so well crafted so excellent that it defies my descriptive powers to sum it up here
suffice it to say bioware has crafted a tale well worth telling and they should be proud of that if nothing elsebut not all is well in mass effect  before i even touch the ending we need to plow through just how rough and unfinished this game is
the mission structure is horrific tedious and just a chore to navigate
getting missions is easy but thoroughly uninvolving and finding mission sensitive items and where to go is just a nightmare
couple that with just how many missions will simply crash bug out or become outright nonfunctional and how many missions are boring lifeless throwaway garbage and a bulk of me makes you just want to scream
of course all that could have been tolerable had it not been borderline necessary to complete side missions to up your effective military strength ems to get the best ending even though the way in which your ems effects the ending doesnt even begin to make a single shred of sense
and i know you can just play the multiplayer to up your readiness rating blah blah blah
im sorry and no offense intended to those of you who enjoyed the multiplayer but in my opinion that aspect has no place in narrative driven single player role playing game and i have to wonder how much time was sunk into it that couldve been used to improve the single player gameand then of course we get to see how much the role playing has been scaled back
entire cutscenes will go by with commander shepard talking making chices and furthering your story without your input
what
this part really just burns me
after two games and  hours of me controlling my character suddenly now its whisked out of my hands so i can watch my shepard evolve without my input
this is so far against the concept of an rpg that i cannot even wrap my mind around any reason to justify it happeningbut then oh then theres the ending
my god i dont even know where to begin
i wont spoil it herebut suffice it to say that its the most inconclusive nonsensical plot hole ridden condensed choice devoid load of bull bioware couldve pulled
not only is it lousy it completely ignores any and all of the philosophical ideas that were apart of the series narrative such as synthetic and organic coexistence  free will and what it means to be alive and tolerance and unity
overall its so bad and so fully disregards player choices that it actually sullies the enjoyment of the whole trilogy especially knowing that none of your choices mean anything whatsoeverand even if you can put all of that aside it fails on a basic consumerseller level
as a seller bioware promised their product mass effect  would posses certain features conclusive answers previous player choices deeply effect the ending finality and closure which the final product did not have
as consumers we have the right to complain and request not demand as many have done some sort of compensation here
oyi really wanted to totally love mass effect  completely and unabashedly but when it falls it falls hard
there are some truly great aspects but this really is the weakest entry in the series and a hollow ending to the tale of commander shepardout my care for the series out of i have been a fan of this series since the release date of mass effect  i have put my heart and soul into the games and have enjoyed them immensely
the story the decisions the combat the characters and of course the setting
all of these great things are here except for the ending
without spoiling much i just have to say the decisions you made during the course of the hundreds of hours you have invested over all three games like i have cease to matter
you are given a handful of linear endings none which i was impressed by
i wouldnt go near as far as that whack job who tried to sue over the ending haha like he has a chance in hell however i was extremely disappointed
as another reviewer wrote i will forget this horrible ending and read some fan fiction for a substitute something i never domass effect  has a heavy heavy weight to carry
it is the culmination of over five years of hard work from bioware and the many fans who have been there for the journey
it has been laden with difficult decisions to make many people have come and gone and good friends have been losti will say that my expectations for this finale were high
when the first mass effect came out i could not believe that a game with so many variables was attempting to do what bioware was promising
we hadnt really seen anything of this scale before
it was definitely interesting and i believed that bioware could pull it offwhen mass effect  came out i was a little concerned because many of the big decisions you had made in the previous game were either briefly mentioned or merely whispered about
and i hated the forced scenario of working for cerberus
hated it
the playable character lineup was bloated with too many new faces
but it was a great game
i could go back and play me today and still enjoy the heck out of itmass effect  starts off with your shepard in a situation that you have absolutely no control over whether you agree with himher getting their self into this position
i know i didnt
theres no way
it serves as a great setup for the experience you are about to partake in which can be described in one word linear
mass effect  is a linear game in nonlinear clothing
to say that the decisions youve made over the past five years play very little into your experience this time around is an understatement
bioware made the mistake of promising that every decision had a consequence but those consequences are merely replaced with filler characters
thats right
nothing you have done to this point mattersone of the big focuses in this game is collecting war assets
i made the mistaken assumption that by wasting time and raising the galactic readiness and going around wasting even more time scanning planets for war assets and objects to only waste more time bringing said objects to nameless npcs scattered around the citadel that it would make a difference
some kind of a differencenoultimately for a game that has been advertised as having this incredible spectrum of decisions to make it seems that the only decision you need to make is to plow through the game
because the content along the way is completely inconsequential
it doesnt matter what you do in this game at all
if you dont do something that bioware wants you to do another character will do it for you
if you have a character killed bioware replaces them with a random new guy
if you waste as much time as i did actually bothering to collect war assets and raise galactic awareness  well you figure that one outdespite all this i can not say that mass effect  is a bad game
absolutely not
i loved it
i had absolutely no problem with my game
the combat feels complete this time around and there is no behemoth three ring circus of characters to choose fromignore this time aroundi was however disappointed by the ending
i felt that for all that we had worked for for so long we deserved something more
the ending in mass effect  feels like a nintendoera ending where all you get is a title card telling you conglaturation
or something
except instead of congratulating you the game asks you to spend more money on dlc
thats disgusting bioware
shame on you
seriously
shameonyouultimately i believe that mass effect  in its present state is a forgettable end to an unforgettable seriesthis is a great fun game with improved gameplay from the me
to everyone who is starring it because of the ending i ask what about the journey
should a game only be judged by its ending
i had a blast from beginning to end
i do agree the ending is weak but i cant throw out a  hour game because the last  minutes are  subpar
for me the journey is more importantgreat game and a beautiful ending to the series
i especially loved the last few hours
i would definitely recommend iti must preface this review by saying that i am a major mass effect fan
i have played mass effects  and  through eight times now working to finish all of those imported characters in mass effect 
i have read all of the books even suffering through mass effect deception which was awful
i have read all of the comic books
therefore i believe i speak with a level of credibility on the subject of the mass effect universeill cut right to the chase and address the issue that most people are having with the game then ill follow it with the less controversial stuff
the following includes spoilers
you are fighting throughout the game to rid the galaxy of the threat of annihilation by machines known as the reapers
most people are having issues with the end of the game
at the end you have three choices destroy the reapers control the reapers or assimilate organics with synthetics to make all organic life organicsynthetic hybrids
if you choose the latter two shepard dies
no matter what choice you make the normandy crashes and the crew set off into a lush green world presumably to start afresh in some sort of colony
the destruction of the reapers ending implies that shepard dies only to show himher take a breath hinting that heshe survived
a major complaint i have heardread is that you have literally hundreds of variables imported from the previous two games combined with the decisions in the third game and none of them are addressed in the ending
while this is true in a sense it is not entirely accurate
although the ending cinematic is one of three there are ample opportunities for cut scenes and conversations with your squad mates that lend both closure and hope for some resolution
yes the ending is open
it is understandably intentionally so
with over a thousand choices in the three games combined having specific endings is not possible by any stretch of the imagination
you would need whole extra discs just to accommodate that
instead just as the game is unique to the player playing it it is possible to chart a path of choices through the three games that is entirely your own you must take what you want from the ending
it is clever and excellent writing on behalf of the writing team and few people seem to fully understand it
after hundreds of hours of play time between the three games and  years invested in it it is understandable that some people are upset with the ending
i find it respectable that bioware didnt simply program a mega happy ending where shepard walks off into the sunset of whichever planets sun with ashley or liara or tali etc
this ending is one that many will hate but one that is quite goodnow that i have addressed the most controversial part of the game ill highlight the amazing and less controversial stuff
first the gameplay is so refined
playing through mass effect    in succession illustrates the evolution of the game
part  introduced a more intuitive cover system better access to powers etc
part  builds on the advances of part  and adds rolling ladder usage and turret accessibility among other things
a charged melee and stealth takedowns from cover are also welcome additions
the graphics of the game are the best of the trilogy
the story is very good the game does an excellent job of using cut scenes dialogue and computer terminals and email to solve the nagging questions of the story
for those of you who have read the books the addition of kahlee sanders grissom academy and kai leng are good tie ins
it adds a degree of satisfaction to kill kai leng in the game after he so often escapes in the booksthe multiplayer is a good addition as well
i have heard the complaint that some feel that the attention of the design team was taken away from the main story to complete the multiplayer
this doesnt appear to be the case
the main game is too polished for this to be true
i must note that the multiplayer match making is quite good i get into online games faster than most other games i play
the multiplayer levels are also playable by shepard in the single player
the ability to play with different races and access different powers is fun and strangely addicting
the kinect features are good but at times unnecessary you can read the dialogue even though it is faster to just select an option
you can say things like open when next to a door to open the door when it is faster to press a to open the door
the only thing with the kinect that i found to be truly helpful was in combat the xbox functionality allows you to only map  powersabilities to buttons
to use your other powers you need to pull up the power wheel which pauses the action select the power and then the game resumes
with the kinect you can say any power yours or a teammates and the power is executed
it makes combat a little more seamless
unlike pc players who can map powers through many keys the ability to map powers to only three buttons on the xbox can be limiting and the kinect makes up for itoverall the game is excellent
many people dont like the endings but that actually doesnt surprise me at all
i feel that the game does a great job of tying everything together throughout rather than in some grandiose ending cut scene
the gameplay is excellent the story is excellent
i recommend this game to everyone and i will warn them upfront that the ending is not perhaps what they expect or want
nonetheless it is superbly well donethe series reminds me of the lord of the rings movies the third movie is excellent on its own won best picture that year but it is augmented by the two preceding movies
in the same way i believe that someone who plays this game without having played the previous two games will find enjoyment
however the third game is bolstered by the relationships and decisions of the previous two games
the game is an epic end to an amazing trilogy
i would not be surprised of it wins many game of the year awards this yearimprovements on gameplay and story over the previous installments
the very end was a bit disappointing but overall the game was as good or better in every other way than its predecessorsstarting off with the fact that a majority of your play time will consist of cut scenes and not actually playing the game
if i hadnt skipped the dialogue so often my time would have easily been  hours instead of  and a half
there are not a lot of dialogue choices eitheras for the changes in the game play  light melee attacks come off as playful taps while heavy melee attacks seem easily avoidable and yet an enemy will just stand there
the fact that they stripped the gun play down so much is disappointing
instead of dealing with a gun that simply overheats you have to constantly reload and find ammo i am very annoyed they changed it when it was perfectly fine originallythe new characters in the game are not that likable then again neither are the reoccurring ones due to poorly written dialogue
the story is painfully unsatisfying as welloverall mass effect  simply changes too much and not in a good way thus making it one of the most disappointing games i have ever playedthe character importer does not import faces from existing shepherds so you are stuck with someone that looks nothing like your character from the first two
i had it since it came out and can not and will not play it until it is fixed
bottomline the game is a waste of money until it is fixed if ever
even then i hear the endings are horrible and apparently bioware is thinking about fixing them
it seems that this game should have been delayed another year to fix all of the problems or restarted from scratchfinsihed the game for a nd timeafter reading all i could about the ending i made sure i had a score of over  did i get the so called ending no
just the  choices
the first one either control the reapers or the nd choice destory it all
did the firts choice control the reapers as i am looking at the ship now i know i choice vega as part of my assault i am wondering how he ended up back on the ship once it crashed landed that made no sense at all
all of the cannon that bioware started in the first  games as far as i know is now completely out the window
and they charged  for what
whatever bioware does for this so called new footage they plan and if there is a god i hope they serious change this ending the way the game ended this not even worth 
just a hyped up game to make people buy there product nothing more to it
the only way i even consider the dlc is if they seriously clean up this farce of an endingthis wasnt the review i wanted to give
believe me it wasnt
i wanted to give a review praising this game
i wanted to talk a lot about the struggle between fear and hope
i also really wanted to compliment bioware and the programming team as a whole as they really made me love all the relationships in the game not just the sexbut the friendships which came so naturally
but i cant
i just cantive played mass effect from the beginning like many of you out there
there have been many many great reviewsand i wanted to add my own voice
maybe youll agree with me
maybe you wont
thats cool either way
all i can express is my own views on the game
i loved the gameplay
i think bioware perfected the interface
battles worked smoothly
the roleplaying aspects seemed intuitive as well
it is trueyour choices do not matter in the game
bioware lied
they promised the players that the choices made in mass effect  and  would play a major if not important part in mass effect  but that was not the case
important missions and events in the first two games got mentioned briefly and nothing more
the decisions came off as reminiscing rather than mattering
i felt and still feel lied to
i paid  for this game through amazoncom
but i didnt get the complete game
in order to get the prothean into the party i had to shell out an additional ten dollars
bioware made a day one dlc for a character that seems critical to the overarching narrative of what happened to the past races
getting one in the group makes sense from a storytelling perspective as it is coming full circle
and since this was a day one dlc this character was already made well before the game was in final production
they saw a way to milk additional money out of fans of the series
so would i get the complete game for 
of course not
in order to have access to the happy ending i own an xbox i have to shell out additional money to get access to online play
that could range between    a month
im looking at a minimum  for a complete playthrough
they are just trying to get every penny they can out of the player
the endingmany wiser people than i have commented on the ending
i want to add to the voice of general discontent
i wanted a happy ending
an epilogue
i want to learn what happened to everyone in a long epilogue
did tali and garrus make it
what about ashley
what occurred with her
i couldnt find her when saying goodbye to everyone
she crashlanded on the planetwhat happened to the love of shephards life
and even more broadly what happened to the galaxy after the reapers
without the relays what happened
was there efforts to rebuild them
did the geth finally make peace with their creators
and the krogan
what happened with the krogan
there were so many questions
no answersi want to go on but i cannot
words escape me
i wanted to love this game
i wanted to praise it
but now
i just cantavoid this entire seriesthe ending should have been simple
the crucible is just a monstrous laser beam that tears reapers into little bits and then we have shepard wake up on the normandy lord of the rings styleand then the epilogue plays
to celebrate the victory the biggest party in galactic history is thrown on the citadel
everyone gets filthy drunk and dances the night away
edi and joker try to have sex which ends with a shattered pelvis
grunt does some hilarious stuff jack gets in a catfight with miranda jello optional garrus and shepard go swimming in the giant lake wrex tries to join them and almost drowns in a funny way but finally gets that fish someone pours a gatorade bucket mass effect equivalent on hacketts head who flips out at first but ends up having fun and other general hijinx ensueand then afterwards theres a bunch of shots of the different species rebuilding their homeworlds
shots of the quarian and geth getting along the leftover reaper corpses towed into space and blown into bits red tape being cut etc
happy happy happyand then theres a love interest ending
for example ashley and shepard are shown with her family on earth maybe starting a new life together in the military
or whoever the love interest wasjust show them togetherand then the final shot is of the statue of shepard that gets erected in the citadel and it fades to creditsand there are no child gods i dont feel like i should have to explain whythis game is amazing
and the fact that the company went and added some free dlcs when there were some complaints about the ending was really nice of them
if youre a fan of the series definitely a must have be prepared to cry at the end when its all overlet me preface this review by stating that im sure the the first and second mass effect games would be in my list of the top  games of alltime and probably nearer to the top
mass effect  was an incredible blend of oldschool scifi noir and modern gameplay mechanics
mass effect  was a darker spin on that universe with a dirty dozen vibe of teambuilding
mass effect  is for someone who enjoyed the first two games a slap in the face
i will try to avoid spoilers for me as much as possible with minor spoilers for me and mewhat went wrongnot my character
the entire point of this trilogy is that a player could create a custom character in the first game and their decisions can be imported across both sequels so that everything in the third game is customized based on past decisions across both prequels
sounds great right
well bioware admitted they didnt actually have anyone test this for the third game and it turns out if you imported the same character from me to me and want to cross over to me your save file is unreadable and you will be forced to play a default character instead
bioware claim theyre looking at implementing a fix now that theyve been told about this but launching the game without this feature is inexcusable
technical note your save data will only work if you made changes to your characters face during the import from me to me but this was not stated at the time and why would you do that if you bothered to import your character in the first place
not my decisions
again a major marketing point of the trilogy was the ability for your decisions to have impact across all three games
in the end however you will be given a choice between three mostly prefabricated endings and the biggest difference between those is a color change
red blue or green
thats all your decisionmaking across three games has mattered swapping some colors
throughout mass effect  and to a lesser extent me your decisions dont really have major effects anyway
let a character die and theyll be replaced in the next game by a similarlynamed character with nearly identical looks and dialog
or worse you just wont be presented with a certain quest option and thus have no clue at all what you missed
there really arent any penalties for any decisions you have made or will make and the fate of the galaxy depends more on playing multiplayer than anything else you donot my ending
okay ill admit i wanted a happy ending to the series
but i had good reason to hope for this
the entire point of me and me is that shepard is the lone hero the only force in the galaxy that can overcome insurmountable odds to win the day and save the galaxy
shepard literally returned from the dead during the second game yet during the third we are presented with a true nowin situation
not to spoil any specifics but all three endings involve crushing defeat
you as a player have control over neither of these story options shepards death in  and all endings in  are almost entirely prescripted
so which is it bioware is shepard an unstoppable juggernaut of hope or the tragically fated hero
you cant have bothnot my galactic readiness or is it ems
supposedly in me the fate of the galaxy depends on the galactic readiness which measures all the assets youve prepared to fight the bad guys
only there are actually two statistics and youre not really told which is which so you might look at the wrong one for most of the game you actually want effective military strength because galactic readiness only boosts ems even though galactic readiness seems like the importantsounding one
it also turns out galactic readiness can only be improved by playing multiplayer or the ios app for mobile devices while ems can only be improved in singleplayer which you probably wont pick up ingame
so you cannot change galactic readiness at all in the singleplayer game and this doesnt seem to be stated clearly in the game itself
and although bioware promise theres enough stuff in singleplayer to boost ems to the necessary levels most people report getting one of the bad endings despite completing what they thought was  of the game
got that
i didnt
its a messthere are a lot of other reasons to hate me
savvy internet folk have noticed that major elements of me have been ripped off of internet resources including major aspects of the game being based off of yearsold stock photographs that the developers spruced up in photoshop
publishers electronic arts are still trying to bilk peoples wallets by selling cerberus network passes to people who dont buy the game new which also requires signing up for ea services just to unlock the features
theres been heavy hinting that the lackluster ending of me will be patched up in future downloadable content which you can bet youll have to pay for especially if you dont want to pony up for cerberus network by handing your personal information to ea
the forces that be stopped so low as to charge money for new character clothing in the last game and you can bet theyll bring that back for this gamein the end there are a few moments in this game that are absolutely praiseworthy mordins storyline in particular is brought to an incredible climax but its just not worth it
if you played me and me with the hopes of seeing your same character in the third game odds are you literally cant do that unless the game has been patched in the meantime so just go with the story you made up in your head and be happy with it
dont let bioware and ea ruin the good memories you forged in the first two gamesi was a huge fan of mass effect
i also liked mass effect  despite some disappointing changes in the core fundamentals of the game
i was really hoping that with the third and final game in the mass effect trilogy bioware would make the perfect game listening to fan feedback correcting past mistakes and combining the best of the previous games
unfortunately mass effect  is the worst game in the series making a lot of mistakes and omitting the parts that made the previous games so greati loved the deep rpg elements of the first me so when me streamlined simplified a lot of the rpg elements i was a little disappointed
i hoped that me would bring back some of the deeper rpg stuff like weapon armor and character upgrading but they kept it streamlined much like me
this makes the game feel more like an action shooter than an rpgme also simplifies a lot of your conversations reducing the dialogue wheel to just renegade or paragon choices and nothing else
for me having tons of dialogue options made me feel more in control of my character
now i feel like i can only play one of two characters bioware forces me to be instead of being my character
less is the name of the game and in an rpg it comes as a letdownthe side missions in the first me were not as good as the main missions and after a while got repetitive but i still liked that they contributed to my characters progression both in experience and development
in me the side missions were fewer but felt more realized and were overall better
often characters i saw and helped in me would reappear in me and in some instances they would give me more side missions
your choices in the first me seemed to have consequences in me
in me most of your decisions in me and  have little effect on me
mostly it just results in one line from an old character and you cant even respond to them
then theres the side missions
or rather the lack of them
what happenedme was supposed to be the biggest best deepest game in the series but it wound up being the smallest shallowest gamethe addition of multiplayer is interesting and can be fun but to force players to partake in multiplayer seems unfair especially if you dont have an xbox live account
if you dont play multiplayer it will have a negative impact on your single player experience
this is just plain wrong to punish players for not paying for xbox livethe shooting gameplay is solid
it is very similar to me with a few tweaks here and there
the addition of the stab action is neat but doesnt make the game better
overall no real complaints in the controls or gameplay areathe biggest disappointment with me has to be the ending
youve probably heard people complain about it defend it call it artistic theorize about indoctrination etc
the fact is the ending is just sloppy
i wont spoil it but without going into detail i can say that the ending is nonsensical
for the people defending that its artistic i ask what is the artistic merit in making a confusing irrational ending that gives no closure and breaks continuity
for the people claiming that its indoctrination that doesnt make the ending less terrible
thats like stories that end with it was all a dream
every writer worth his salt knows that it was all a dream is a cheap device that lazy writers use because they cant be bothered to wrap things up in a clever waythe biggest crime in the ending is that all of your decisions big and small dont count for anything in the last hour of the game
renegade paragon level  or level  male or female which characters you saved who you romanced and all of that doesnt matter
no matter how you played you will be funneled into a room and given three choices
each choice result in the same ending with different colored explosion
what was the point of all my decisions up to this point if a level  female renegade can make the same decision and get the exact same ending as a level  male paragon with different squadmates
for a game that puts so much emphasis on letting players affect the story the ending throws that out the window at a time when it was most importantbioware offers up some dlc and some say that future dlc will give closure to the games ending but this doesnt change the fact that i paid  for an incomplete game with a very poorly executed ending
also dlc doesnt fix the ending for people who dont have xbox live or dont care to spend even more money on dlc
you must evaluate a product on what is presented not on what could be or might be or speculation for the future
what is currently presented on the me disc is a disappointmentthere are some good moments in the main campaign but side missions are few and poorly executed rpg stuff is too streamlined character development is limited and the ending is just tacked on crap
had this been the first game in another series i would have just been content to say bad game and move on
but i have invested both time and money into the previous games because of their excellent quality and i had reasonably high hopes for the third game to conclude the amazing stories of these engaging characters i had grown to love
instead everything that mattered was discarded and the ending was the final nail in the coffinif you dont buy this game you will have to suffer through the lack of closure to your story and if you buy this game you will have to suffer through the lack of closure to your storymy original review was a little negative about its ranking
i now need to reconsider the overall game valuestoryline well conceived working to an obvious outcome though not popular to the hardliners shepherd in keeping with his character depiction has only one choice
the hero sacrifices himself in the highest tradition
a true endingafter gaining the th level and with the th ranking on weapons the game becomes more exciting and insanity is a definite challenge
the game is a definite winner as the last in line of mass effectnote since i got a collectible edition for  i noticed all the cheapo collectibles have now disappeared
guess my mention spurred those salesshame on everyone who gave this game a  star ratingmass effect  was a great game from start to almost finish
the very last cut scene of the game was a little disappointing but only a little
if i could have knocked my review down to  stars instead of  i might have but there is no way on earth this is a  star gamethe graphics game play story and characters were all stellar and the fact that the ending wasnt some happy triumph doesnt mean we lump this game in with bargainbasement  star titlesgreat game works great came with the online pass that hadnt been used and i look forward to completing this gamelike everyone else has pretty much said the ending is quite terrible in this game
it is so disconnected with all of the previous content in any of the games that it makes it feel like you are not even playing the same game
i dont even know how they thought this ending would make sense yes there are  endings but they are all the same
it is complete garbage
nothing in it makes any sense after you are done with cerberus
none of the characters matter and there is no real resolution with harbinger or the allucit man
it becomes some kind of bs indirect ending that was never hinted being possible but just shoved down our thoats like we would just accept iti dont give this game a  or  because it is actually a fun game but i understand why people have
we have commited hours upon hours to this series to have such a terrible endingsome additional things
i feel bad for those that dont have the dlc cause he is a major character with major plot lines associated with him
also i dont think they did as good of a job with the character development in this game compared to the previous
the new characters do not have as much substance to them and most of the old ones barely give anything additional to the story
it is like they just have conclusions to their me characters
there are a few exceptions like tali and miranda
but most characters just feel like add ons
more of the story is focused on the larger scale effects to the characters not the personal aspects like previous gamesalso in my mind there is no way to do dlc unless it effects the ending
i am not going to go back like the game takes you after you beat it to before the cerberus conflict and do dlc
it is pointlessin closing it was a good attempt by bioware and me and me are fantastic but i dont think they new how to do an ending that would actually use all the pieces to this game
instead they gave us a disconnected ending that was just lazy and wrecks the gameupdatethe new endings are better
destroy is well done and probably the most effective ending to the series
control is good and a little dark
synthesis is kind of goofy now
the th option they could have explored a little more because there could have been some depth there but it is funny to me
this game is still not a  star game
especially compared to  and  but it is worth playing now and an acceptable conclusion nownd updateplayed through the first game again and most of the nd one
put my review back to  stars
beyond the improved combat this game just does not stand up against the other two
the story just shuts down the other  games
the enemy should have been harbinger not the star child
he does not even say anything in the last game
when he was the main protagonist of the first  games
he was like the emperor in star wars and we were given no conclusion
the star child was a joke and the updates are only acceptable based on being ok with the star child
also the third game does not come close to the character developement of the second game and it just shuts down all that you worked for with the crew from me ea and bioware have will not be part of my game purchases going forwardi just cant believe what has become of bioware
i had a sinking feeling when i heard that they had been bought out by ea but remained hopeful that ea would allow them to continue to make the high quality immersive rpgs i had grown to love
honestly bioware is the only reason i even still own a gaming console but with each game released by bioware i am starting to realize that their heyday of making great rpgs is a thing of the past and i think the mass effect trilogy stands as a testament to that
while i would say by comparison to their other games me was mediocre at best it was still a decent overall rpg
me showed a transition to more of a shooter and this one really completes that metamorphosis into a full on shooterwhile bioware games have alway been a bit linear in nature but i never felt as if i was being forced down a path as you could explore pretty much at will
thats gone with this title and you are pretty much forced down a corridor
to make it worse minutes of dialogue seem to take place without you being given the chance to select what to say so that element of you being your character has been dumbed down
i dont play shooters to really know but i would say the mechanics targeting and such in this are horrible
enemies seem to move fast and my aim feels soooo slow for instancei dont know but after da and now this game i think it is time to start mourning the loss of bioware and the topnotch immersive story telling rpg they pioneeredi hate you eai absolutely hate you for destroying what bioware used to beto all the people complaining about the ending i think penny arcade summed it up best i went into mass effect  with incredibly high expectations
from the trailers leading up to the release of the game you could tell that the emotional impact was going to be significant
the reapers are finally here
in a universe with such rich backstory where decisions have a major impact and youve grown to know and love characters over the dozens of hours of the two previous installments it would be easy for bioware to have a major misstepluckly they didnt
this game is amazingthe scale and scope of the game leaves me in awe
from the skyscraper sized reapers to the battles that are occurring in the background
from the magical space battles to the conversations with the crewmates everything is beautifully done
bioware knew what they wanted to do with this game and they delivered in spadesgameplayif you enjoyed the feel of mass effect  more than  youre in luck
the gameplay carries over almost verbatim
squadmates are even more independent than me and thats a good thing
the micromanagement that went into me was tactically interesting but really slowed down the battles
they know what needs to be done and they do it
getting into and out of cover is at times a little wonky as in the past but there are times when it flows perfectly it feels like a perfectly executed maneuver
then sometimes i bounce around and get shot in the face win somelose somethe only notable addition are the melee strikes
this is helpful as more often than not youre forced to abandon cover whether its a grenade or youre being charged
this makes the battles a little more dynamic than the pop out of cover when the other guy does battles of me and makes them feel a little more fast paced
i generally avoid melee unless i have to but its an interesting addition nonetheless
i will say straight up that the environments and enemy types vary more than the previous two games combined and thats awesome
its nice to face different strategies keeps things freshtheres the kinect option to use
i tried it and i couldnt get anyone to listen me half the time
i attribute it to the fact that my speakers were cranked so if this were real life they probably couldnt hear me anyway
yeah thats the ticket
on the rare occasion it does work its pretty coolgraphicsthe look is a little crisper the framing a little better everything looks a little more polished
i absolutely loved the background events the cinematic space battles all of the crazy stuffsoundeverything is very sharp and works well on my surround system
the reapers make some sort of crazy bass sound that shakes my entire living room
its awesome
seriouslymultiplayerif you liked gears of war horde mode youll love this
simple as that
i think its fun but im always placed with random since my friends dont buy games very often
still its pretty sweet
plus it helps you becomes more prepared in the actual campaign
its not required to play but its a nice touch
persistent leveling also gives a sense of purpose
be careful cranking it up to hard it gets pretty nutsoverallget it
if you loved me and me this could be a bucket of crap and youd get it since the story is so amazing
luckily its fantastic
enjoythis game is a disappointing sequel because of how little this game has to do with the fantastic mass effect  though i understand why
bioware needed to make this game playable to everyone who played me and would import their saves
because of this me had to make sense to people who had the worst possible ending of me
so it makes sense to have as little to do as possible with me
so even if you were like me and reloaded games until everyone spoilers survived the ending in meend spoilers it doesnt matter because they only briefly appear in this game except for  of them
this is a shame because me had a great cast of characters that i would have loved to have more interaction with in this game
this game really feels like a sequel to me and not memy biggest complaint with this game is that bioware claimed we didnt need to play the multiplayer to get the optimal best ending which is technically not true
to get the optimal best ending you need your effective military strength to be really high
ems is a combination of war assets which you get in single player divided by the galactic readiness which stands default at 
the only way to increase the galactic readiness divider is with the apps or the multiplayer
so even if you gather all the war assets in single player the total effective military strength will be  of all your war assets which is not enough to get the optimal best ending
im pretty angry about this because i dont want the apps or to play the multiplayer
so what is my incentive to obsessively get all the war assets if i cant get the highest ems
so what is the point in including this egg hunt if there is no real reward for your customers
i know the best ending is pointless anyways it only add a couple of seconds to the ending but they shouldnt have done thatother than those minor issues this game is a giant improvement over the previous ones combatwise
you have more different types of enemies they are constantly moving and reacting to your combat style
they are unique and require different tactics to defeat them
this is way better than simplistic the combat in me and  where you just sat there and killed off waves of enemies
you can once again upgrade your weapons and add parts to customize it to your liking similar to how it was in me
you are now capable of using any weapon competently
in me you could carry and use any weapon regardless of your class but if the weapon did not suit your class your aim was really bad
i played as a vanguard so i was terrible with the assault rifle in me and could not even carry it in me
now i finally get to use it and actually hit targets in me
on the one side i am upset because my character class shouldnt be able to use the assault rifle but on the other hand i really like using it heeheethis game is good is a fun shooter and has good customizing elements and great characters
but the story is what really made the previous games great
they really made you feel like what you did mattered in the game and that all your consequences would be present in me but they are not
this is not a bad game at all and probably deserves a better rating than the one it has as a stand alone game
but this is a sequel and as such it has to be compared and rated to its predecessors
unfortunately in my opinion this is a disappointing addition to the mass effect seriesthe story combined with the spineless tactic of dangling the best ending carrot to try and force you to play their multiplayer or aps really ruined this game for mespoilerfree review from a fan of me but not a crazypassionate readallthebooks kind of fan
i have played through the entire me trilogy i really liked me thought me was better overall and ill put me just a little behind mei understand a lot of people have very passionate opinions about this gameseriesending and i was well aware of the reviewhate before receiving my copy
based on some of the user reviews i was expecting some sort of horrifically comical ending like where i dont know liara takes off her blue mask and she was the illusive man after all 
or something
so when i got near the ending i was truthfully somewhat excited to finally see what wretched souldestroying curveball bioware concocted in their evil attempts to alienate their fan base
a few moments later i finally reached the ending and i thought it was finebefore constructive criticism is aimed my way know that i do understand how the ending could be underwhelming for certain people who are truly invested and that i find your onestar ratings valid and acceptable if you truly felt emotional disturbance by the outcome
im not going to go into detail on my personal thoughts of the ending but it wasnt anywhere close to what the hatereviews made me believe i was actually impressed in bioware for attempting to take the route of artistic integrity in a mainstream and high production even if they did or didnt really pull it off to each their own
i would definitely recommend this game if youre on the edge but scared off by the user feedback  i dont regret my purchase in the least it was a great gamei really enjoyed playing the first two games and liked the fact that your saves can be used on the next game over
mass effect  seemed absolutely exceptional on the trailers and gameplay videos i watched before picking up the game
when i loaded it up and started playing all seemed to be well i was enjoying myselfthen came the last bit of the game
what i witnessed was the equivalent of what a parent would go through if their child was kidnapped and tortured
i feel like i was robbed
there is no reason why this ending should exist
and not only this the developers are fine with the ending and have no plans to change itgreat job ea being the sellouts that you are known to be
and great job as well bioware it must have taken so much effort to ruin what should have been game of the yearwarningthis review contains content that could be spoilers for some
i tried to keep it as vague as possible while conveying disappointment with the endingi cant see giving this game lower than  stars because it was just so incredible
bioware stepped up their game and the sp and mp are both second to none
the voice acting and story telling is even better than the previous two games imo
i was on the edge of my seat for the whole game but theni dont want to give anything away but there were some major glitches in the last parts of the game that caused me to have to restart my system and play missions again
this may have been somewhat unique to my gameplay but it was unacceptable and took away from the story for me
they werent just little glitches that can be forgiven but major ones that impacted my gameplay
ie
you get to make a choice at the end of the game for the ending you want and i didnt know which was which
i walked up to one and then it was glitched and i couldnt walk away from it so i was forced to choose the ending that i didnt wantas far as the ending i actually thought it was kind of cool
i was hoping for something a little less dark but i guess i expected that it would have to be a little bleak if humanity was going to stop something that had been going on for billions of years
my issue is that they didnt explain enough and the different endings were too similar
i made a lot of major decisions in all three games that didnt seem to matter in the end i watched all the endings and there wasnt much difference between them
i did everything right and got my forces up to full strength but it doesnt really feel like it matters
i would have liked to have seen about a  minutes cutscene at the end that rapped everything up but they didnt deliver
 years of my life ends in a way that was somewhat unsatisfying
again i like the concept of the ending but they could have explained more and showed the aftermath of your decisions
i would have liked to have seen bigger differences in the ending choices and the decisions you had made
they could have given me a video that showed how everyone was doing in the new world and what the consequences of the choices were
it feels like they just ran out of time or money at the end and chose not to pursue a more in depth ending sequence
ive come to expect the highest quality from bioware they delivered up until the very endi would still highly recommend this game though
i cant think of any other games that rival the depth and emotion of this game
i would pay a lot more than  bucks for games if other companies could deliver like thisplease come out with a  or  minutes dlc video that explains everything for me bioware
ill pay you  bucks
thanksif they release something that improves on the ending ill change my rating to  stars
update extended cut offers pretty much what i was hoping for in an ending the ending that was already great but just didnt provide closure or answer questions now gave me what i wanted
thanks for fixing the ending and making a great game worthy of  stars bioware
ive changed my rating to  nowi am a huge fan of the mass effect game series
the game itself is a good game
written well great graphics but the ending is what ruined it for me
not sure why bioware decided to end the series this way
false advertising about the game play through effecting the ending
there are basically three endings and they are pretty much the same
i cannot give it five stars due to this
i personally will not be buying any of the future mass effect games if there are anyim not going to belabor the facts that the singleplayer game is only worthwhile to those who have played the first two games the ending is horrible the dlc only matters to diehard fans the game mechanics are clunky when compared to other shooterrpg hybrids like fallout and bioware and ea have made so many public relationsgame design missteps with this game that they made rick santorums campaign for presidency look sane
mass effect  is a threestar singleplayer experience but something must be said for the multiplayer which i also give a threestar ratingat first multiplayer is very enjoyable
you choose a class adept soldier engineer infiltrator sentinel or vanguard and a classspecific race
each race within a class has slightly different abilities
you can name individual characters which really has no purpose since only you will see the names change their appearances and equip a wide variety of weapons and mods
next you choose a level to play on theres a decent variety here an enemy to face cerberus geth or reapers and a difficulty setting bronze silver gold or platinum
then youll find yourself in a fourplayer lobby from where you launch the game
players work together fighting against ten waves plus one extra wave before an extraction of enemies
every third sixth and tenth wave there is a random objective to complete within a time limit
there are five possible objectives hack a terminal disableenable four electronic devices scattered throughout a level find two packages and bring them to designated areas destroy four target enemies or escort a hovering ball to a specific location
you earn credits awarded after battle for completing objectives and experience for completing a battle
the experience levels up the class you are using up to level  and a level up gives you points to upgrade character abilities
credits can be used to purchase packs and the packs unlock various weapons weapon upgrades mods additional character appearances and a few other things
all of this sounds great and it is undoubtedly fun and even addicting to unlock weapons and try out all of the characters
if you reach level  with a class you can promote it which raises your n level a number that all players see but has no purpose beyond bragging rights helps to acquire one achievement in the singleplayer campaign or unlock the true singleplayer game ending and resets the class back to level  this is an excellent thing to do when you want to spend ability points in a different manner and test out new character buildsthis all sounds good right
it is until you realize that there is only one game mode so multiplayer gets stale fast and feels like a repetitive level grind or money grab
furthermore it takes a while to amass credits to purchase packs and upgrades are randomly awarded in the packs
it isnt too bad to unlock the basic highlevel weapons but the chance of getting the ultrarare weapons the most powerful and fun weapons to wield is extremely low
it is not worth your time to farm do the same thing over and over to earn credits in order to fish for these randomlyawarded ultrarare items
and there are a number of bugs that need addressing like certain passive character abilities or weapon mods not doing a thing and a vanguard glitch that sometimes makes the class get stuck in a level rendering you useless for the battle
these things make for a poorlydelivered multiplayer experience
multiplayer dlc which is luckily free places new characters and weapons in packs and makes them available as random rewards
while this adds variety the single game mode and the randomness of item unlocking will still tick you off
i do have to give bioware a little credit for trying to patch the game and for weeklyimplemented game balance changes that buff or nerf weapons and abilities in order to give players a better allaround experience but the game is incomplete many of the balance changes are questionable and i cant get over the painful random number generator system that may or may not reward you with an upgrade when you make a purchase with the ingame credits that you accrueif you love the mass effect universe definitely get this game and test out multiplayer just expect repetition and dont expect gameoftheyearquality worklove it
buy it
the multiplayer is really a whole new exp
and a very addictive one and if you have mass effect one and two or you have those or played them this is a must have
single player alone is incredible and the multiplayer makes it great to play with friends and make new ones across the globe and there are so many free dlcs for it as well
just great
one of the best series ever made buy me   and  you will be happyi played  first then played  then i played  again and then   the reason i played  again after  is because your decisions carry over from each gamealmost ever single decision you make from the beginning of mass effect  to the end of  have and effect and carry over through games
i thought that was amazing and something that no game has ever done
they are all different games and play styles but combined one great storyline
and what i mean by they are all different is that its not like you are playing the same game  times
your playing  games with a different set of components and gameplay style
i edited this to try to give more detail but if you have any questions askmass effect buy them all
they are great just trust mei cannot see anything less than  stars because every single aspect of the game was just so much fun and well putuntil the end
i completed the game  day ago and at first i was disappointing with the ending
after a couple of days of letting it set in i start to understand the ending and go along with it
underneath i will talk about stuff that include spoilers but for now i wont
the story is just great there are decisions you make that can effect if some people live or die
the game starts off with an epic moment and even cerberus pulls of an epic moment
the final battle was tenseeven on normal difficulty
spoilers the ending at first was a big disappointment
to see everything i have done in me and me to transfer over to me and then see shepard get killed for doing paragon is just sad
for me when the normandy was flying away from the blast and landed on the island i got more to see than others
others only see the ship door start to open and thats it
for me it showed joker liara garus and several others walk out of the ship alive and well and look out at the forest of the planet they just landed on
i for one hope that upcoming dlc add to the ending story
i would love to know what happened to the people that are still alive i would love to see what the remaining crew does i would just love to have had a different ending where shepard was still alive and kicking it with liaramy romance
with the relays destroyed how to the allied fleets get back home
just fly for many years until they reach homethe ending at first also killed replay valueat first
now that it has sunken into me i feel like i can play the game again
i know there is a secret scene that shows a body lying in ruble with the n logo on the uniform taking a breathe and then the scene just cuts out
i assume this is the renegade option for shepard when things blow up
who knows
i really really just hope that this isnt the end of these characters
mass effect is nothing without themespecially liara
she still has another  years in her life id like to be able to control her at least in the next mass effectread this forum page this part is vital to make us believe that we really think this last part was all a dream
what this is basically saying that when you were hit by the beam you were knocked out
then the following scenes ended up having you make  choices
if you let the reapers live you have been indoctrinated and you do not wake up
if you follow the plan to destroy the reapers then you have freed yourself from indoctrination and wake up in a pile of rubble that you were left in when the harbinger shot the beam at you
this makes too much sense to not believe itmass effect series is a very good story
the first two games were great
mass effect  is a good game but just not up to the standard of the first two
after an annoying  digit code you have to enter to get to play the game you get to wait for a  gb patch to download
 minutes later i am ready to play
just go to the bathroom for the last  minutes of the game and the plot will make more sense than the weird virtual childs explanationprosmutli player was goodpackaging was greatconsnot really alot to say about this game compared to the first two where you can make choices save people or let them die and how the choices you make effect the future game and inside the game itself this does notbig disappointment to trilogygraphics in the second one was way better than thisit had its bumps throughout the game but was still gonna give it a  star till the endingwas a big mass effect fan until i played this hopefully the next one wont be as badmild spoilers regarding characters no plot spoilersthis is a remarkable game
the graphics are superb the voice acting is tremendous and the story line is compelling
it does not deserve a two star average rating last week of march
earth is under attack and you must gather galactic forces to save it
along the way you must make some truly awful decisions witness the cost of an awful war but ultimately prevail against forces that would annihilate all lifefirst every decision you make in me  and me  does play out in me  your relationship with kaidan or ashley is resolved whether you let tali take the blame for her father or not whether you rewrote the geth base or blew it up whether you let the rachni survive or not whether you let the council survive or not whether you kept the genophage research or not whether wrex survives or not or whether you saved the collector base or not etc etcindeed even smaller decisions make an appearance like whether you let the asari at zhus hope survive or not if you did zhus hope becomes a minor war asset or whether you let maelon survive on tuchanka
the amount of voice acting and dialogue writing to support all of the different  branching outcomes must have taken an enormous amount of timeevery character that has survived from me  and me  makes an appearance in me  you can control many of them for some or most of the game
if you make an effort to visit kaidan in the hospital the three or four times it takes he can actually enter your group for the rest of the game works out to about half the game
tali enters your group and remains once you get to the quariansyou work with thane samarra and legion on a few things but you do not control them
grunt makes an appearance
garrus joins you for the whole game and the shepardgarrus friendship is rewarding
liara stays with you the whole game if she is the shadow broker that is included as well
i am leaving out some but you get the pointsome gamers have criticized the ending of the game because it does not include what happens to each character in the epiloguebut you do learn what happens to each character and you get to take part
not one character or choice is left unresolved
before the final mission a special effort is made to let you check in with many of themyet the ending transcends such comparatively small things as shepard is forced to deal with much more cosmic issues  and i actually found it to be a wonderfully moving conclusion
like a book or movie mass effect tells a story one which you get to influence but which is nonetheless a story told by its creators
if you think games like dragon age star wars fable etc are any different you are kidding yourselfthey should have probably included a postscript about the characters for those who feel like it didnt matter if it is presented during the story instead of the end truth it doesnt actually matter at all its not real but that would have damaged the sense that sheperd has entered a realm at the end where the decisions are simply so cosmic that nothing else mattersthe bad multiplayer
dont get me wrong  i like the multiplayer fine
if you like horde mode in gears or firefight in halo or similar things you will enjoy this
you get the chance to make multiple characters from different classes and races with a variety of abilities and buy gear for themthe main problem  warning  is that you must play multiplayer to get the best single player outcomes
in other words your multiplayer rating has an impact on the single player gameto add insult to injury to access the multiplayer requires a code
if you buy this game used you will have to purchase one
each day your multiplayer score degrades by  so that if you set the game aside for a couple weeks you will have to play a bunch to get your score back upthis is unacceptable and merits a penalty of two stars
i will only penalize it  stars though because i feel like this game is getting hit too hardfor those turned off by the other reviews keep in mind that this game leaves no questions unanswered and resolves every choice you have made in the other games
every character comes back except ones that have died obviously and you get to see what happens to them all
the ending is not nearly so bad or as brief as everyone says
i strongly recommend giving it a shot stars because of multiplayer parametersedit   it is interesting to me that so many have treated my review with hostility
let me ask this question if you disagree with someone is their opinion thus without worth or valuethough this is only a video game those who cannot show respect for other views in something as unimportant as a video game must surely also fail to show respect when it actually does matter
and this is a poor commentary indeed
i got better reviews when reviewing a book on racetheres a reason why skyrim despite its innitial bugginess  is still selling for  while me has been steadily dropping in priceis it worth if you actually enjoy multiplayer
yesif you like third person shooters with a bit of a story
probablyif you are already a fan of the series and have played the first  games
maybeotherwise
not reallyendings are not the only issue with the game
unlike previous installments the game features extensive amount of auto dialogue graphics are glitchy plot is extremely linear previous installments had a certain degree of linearity but you still had some choice of mission order  this game is basically da in that regard  you dont get to chose and even side missions have to be completed in specific order otherwise they disappearaffect results of main missions adversely side quests are repetitive and n missions are multiplayer maps in a single player setting character interaction has seen both a minor improvement and a dive in quality at the same time
everything is basically a binary toggle
animations in some ways have gotten better in others have gotten horribly worse
clipping is still an issue
your choices dont really matteras for the endings
not only do they contradict the entirety of the lore from the rest of the  hours of the trilogy theres barely any difference in their execution whether you played terribly or were a completionist with an import
very minor changes to cutscenes the color of the explosions but thats about it
they are very much based on rule of cool
think michael bay trying to do existentialism but resorting to explosions anyways
if you want to see the best ending  you have to play multiplayer or inflitratordatapad app
it is impossible to get with single player alonefor pc players it is even worse
if you have the pc version you will need to install and run origin at all times and btw  if you try to run it offline mode it will not register your dlcs if you have them
every time you start a new character  you have to start it online for your game to apply dlcs to it
always on drm schemes are the bane of pc gaming
ea  ubisoft need to stop using themgameplay has seen some improvement from previous  installments so if you are in it for that  this may be a game for you
otherwise
its the worst installment of the trilogy star fun game for terrible ending for dlc abuse  star reviewfinally the game fans have been waiting on for years
while hearing about the day one dlc and the multiplayer i was worried that the single play may have been sacrificed but im glad i was wrong
i had fun playing the game and still find myself playing the multiplayer of this game
one of the coolest things they did is tie in a bunch of the bookscomics into the game storystoryi really enjoyed the story and finding out the effect some of your decisions in previous games really made this a great narrative
along with that the decisions you make in this game have a lasting impact and i was presented with some of the hardest decisions to make ever in a video game
its a really dark game and the story reflects that wonderfullywar assets is new to the mass effect franchise and its basically a pooling of all the resources people ships intel etc that you have collected that will help in your fight
if you dont play the multiplayer you will get a  reduction in your overall score which can really cut it close to being at full readiness if you rent or buy this game usedin between missions and objectives your crew sometimes moves around the normandy and actually have conversations with other crew members instead of standing in one spot the entire time
this makes the ship feel alive and that your members are having lives when you are not there to babysit themon top of all that you have a ton of side missions that help you gather more military strength
while they are fetch quests at heart they can be missable if youre not carefully and most have a pretty cool backstory to them
also every few missions or so you are presented with a situational weapon that can mix things up and sometimes used in more ways than killing your enemiesgameplaybioware has finally perfected the gameplay of the two games in this one
we have the customization from the first game mixed in with the action feel of the second
they included a ton of guns in every specialization smg sniper rifle etc
each gun can have two attachments that can reduce recoil or increase the damage of the weapon
every class can use any weapons but more powerful weapons weigh more which reduces your skill recharge rate and with skills you can carry more weight without lossin singleplayer they brought back the same classes as mass effect  had with some improvements to the quality of them
the max level in this game is back at as i it should be when dealing with mass effect and each class has a ton of skills to choose from
along with that you get to choose an additional skill to level up that comes from your companions main skill so if youre a soldier you can choose to get slam a biotic skill
each class its own heavy melee attack animation as well soldier has an omniblade stab while biotics get a falcon punch style attackplanet scanning is back and its really improved this time around
instead of scanning each planet for multiple resources you fly around using left trigger to scan the system itself for planets or debris for items which can make your presence know to the reapers
on  they added quick saving into the game back button which is something ive wanted to happen for console gamesmultiplayer has the same classes but with only  abilities that you can level up to the max of  in order to get weapons equipment and other usable items like medigels you have to buy trading cardish booster packs that give you uncommonrareultra chances the higher up you go
while this is a cool alterative to getting weapons and what not it gets annoying since nonhuman races have to be unlocked the same waysix maps are included with the game taking place in different parts of the galaxy and are the layout is the same as some of the n missions
three enemies cerberus geth and the reapers are able to fight you on any of the maps and each is really unique
while the ground troops are basically the same the harder enemies vastly differcerberus has atlas giant human controlled robots people with shields powerful turrets snipers and samuraiish warriors
geth have primes giant geths rocket troopers hunters invisible shotgun wielders and pyros flamethrowers
finally the reapers have ravagers brutes and banshees
they all react differently geth and cerberus take cover reapers rush you and with each difficulty bronze silver gold they get increasingly harder and more of the tougher enemies can appear at once
granted this is just horde mode but im having fun with it but it is a mode to play with friends and not by yourselfwhile bioware said it does not have impacts to the story it actually really does
you start out with  galactic readiness and it cuts your military strength in half and the only way to get to  is to play multiplayer
each dayrestart of the game takes away  so you will need to be constantly playing multiplayer to keep 
while normally i would be fine with this but its tied down to an online pass so those who cant play onlinebuy it used will be at a significant disadvantage
not to mention those who only care for single playersoundtrackman was the music really awesome in this game
ever since i watched the trailers main theme i just knew it would be good and i was right
you can pick out themes from mass effect  and  in some of them and if you played those games if you feel a sense of de ja vu while hearing it
mass effect defiantly has some of the best scifi music around
weaponsbioticstech all sound great and didnt really notice wrong with themthe voice acting is still just as awesome as the previous installments and the main character voice actors stay the same
i was never really taken out with pointless dialogue or bad voice acting or anything like that
one complaint i do i have as do many is diana allers jessica chobot
she didnt really have that important of a role and you could kick her off the normandy at any time but her voice just annoyed me and im pretty tolerant when it comes to actors
it just felt forced and i like to hear about the little news segments around the galaxy so i visited her a lotgraphicsbest graphics for a mass effect game yet
all the weapons have great animations the biotics look really awesome and the combat drones look way better in this game
the faces look upgraded and i think they look the best so far
the random planets you go to just look beautiful
some of the best looking sky and outside graphics i have seen in a while
the enemies are well designed and really creepy at timesverdicti had a lot of fun with majority of this game and im still playing the multiplayer with my friends
the gameplay is really fun soundtrack is great and the graphics are top notch
i enjoyed most of the story the music soundtrack and i recommend at least a rental if youre interested in trying this game
it was a powerful awesome and amazing rollercoaster ride to the finish and its one im glad i took written march positives decisions that matter dark story hard decisions situation weapons quicksaving on consoles lots of class diversity really fun gameplay avatar awards blasto  best graphics yetnegatives disc swapping multiplayer required for  rediness but is tied down to online pass
 still cant use makos diana allersjust fyi i loved the first  mass effects played me over  times all the way throughadmittedly at least  were rush jobs where i paid no attention to anything haha and me over  times
also for those who dont now what i mean about obsidian
they are the company that made knights of the old republic  sequel to biowares first massively successful game that led them to making mass effect in the first place
they also made alpha protocol which in many many ways seems to rip off ideas directly from mass effect  from the way the accuracy of weapons work to conversations and general theme of multiple endings and game elements based on you the players choicesmass effect  seems very unfinished and makes things like deus ex seem perfect
dont get me wrong i like deus ex but it was a mish mash of unfinished ideas
anyway some examples are clipping errors
sometimes i find myself standing inside of a box or halfway into a wall
not a big problem but makes me fully aware i am playing a game
in other words im not immersed in the beautiful world theyve made when i dont seem to really be a part of it haha
plenty of random people walking around on the citadel for instance also get stuck on a wall or in a pose and still move forward it looks silly and like an old ps game or something xdand i know im not the only one who noticed the conversations in this game seem like they took the first draft and never did retakes or something
sometimes people say things with wrong emphasis or even bad translation
which doesnt make sense to me isnt bioware an american company
an early example is when they are carting kaiden off to huerta hospital the first visit to the citadel in the game
shepherd asks where they are taking him
one of the people sayswhere to huerta memorial all in one breath like that first where wasnt a question at all
one time recently i was talking to that reporter lady and she said something that wasnt even a sentence sorry i cant remember it thoughnow all of this definitely takes away from the excellent story feel of the previous mass effects that was glorious at least to me but even worse is now the ai
is god awful
your allies were never very intelligent in any of them but now they reach an alltime low
i watched my  allies leaning out of cover to shoot one or  shots when they have an assault rifle they should be shooting a whole clip and they miss those  shots i cant even tell where they were trying to aim
they also get shot to death very easily even on low difficulties which is bad because they are covering my  so if they go down the enemy that killed them immediately destroys my backside
sighthe enemy ai
is pretty bad too at times it is worse than my allies
the first fight you have with a brute enemy in the game for instance
the brute was a scary and cool new enemy and the fight was ruined and i was no longer excited when it rushed to a small corner where one of my allies was and got stuck there making it a joke to defeat as it could not even move
the only real challenge with the normal enemiesie
cerberus soldiers are the unlimited grenades they get to throw at you
this is a very old game mechanic from the first st person shooters ever
enemies get infinite grenades and you get only a few if you are even using a class with that ability and if you level it up at all
unfair and stupid
and worse is how many enemies in me that throw constant smoke grenades making it impossible to see them
i find myself staying in cover bored to death waiting for the smoke to clear which takes a good  seconds give or take
either that or rushing through smoke out of frustration to take my chances in close range against the enemies
lucky im not playing on insanity or  times i have completed a side quest where normally i would have credits or an item to give someone on citadel but got nothing
it just didnt pop up and i got nothing for going so far out of my way
now this is downright unforgivable from a company like bioware whose games are supposed to be among the finest and most polished
there are a few more conversation glitches like people warping away from the screen during a convo
once again making the whole thing feel fake
its like they rushed me out the door
if they had spent just one more year the game could have been up to me and me standards at least
some of these problems may be patched i hope so but the fact is me and me had none of these problems and needed no patches from release
and quite a few of these problems are things that probably cant be patched like the grenade problem and ai
just being dumb
im not sure what others see in this sequel to a thus far amazing story that keeps them saying this is a worthy sequel but i cant even stay engaged in the story because of all these problems
sorry this was so long i really wanted to ventbut in conclusion ratings would be like this mass effect  gets  mass effect  gets  mass effect  gets  thats right and im being generous
if mass effect  were the first in the series id played it would get a 
but i feel emotionally attached to these people and events now from the first  so as a sequel i give it more than a standalone game
oh and for mass effect  if you think i rated it too low its not because i thought it was worse than mass effect  but it was shorter
alot shorter and had no adventuring all over planets with the mako
this was arguably a pretty tedious and pointless thing from the first mass effect but for those who liked it even a little it added quite a few hours to the game and some cool environments
ok doneedit a few spoilers down herenot big ones though i try to keep it obscureafter finishing the game myself i know the ending is very lackluster and a huge letdown to me
after loving this game series and many characters for  games and goodness knows how many hours of my life mass effect  ending might as well be shepherd walking off a cliff falling into a black pit never to be seen again
there are a few ways to do the last moment of the game but they dont change the ending at allfinalethe final choice should be the shining moment of all of mass effect
the choice itself is surprising because the war with the reapers and defeating them being the goal for  games is suddenly changed completely
reminds me of the mind blow matrix revolutions movie ending gave me
in other words a bad surprise
and no matter what you choose the ending cinematic of the game that happens after you choose is the same no matter what save one tiny detail
the color of what happens is either red blue or green
thats it the color changes
wowwithout spoiling too much i can also confirm that there is no showing the future of all of your allies
there is no talking at all
just music while all the cinematic is happening
then after it ends there is a completely generic many centuries later thing that happens reminding me of at least  star trek episodes and maybe a few twilight zones haha
its only about  minutes and doesnt show much while people who you dont know talk about the adventure youve just had like its an old old story
the end
sighcharactersmight as well also mention if you are a fan of the other  mass effects like me you are going to be disappointed on who bioware decided to leave off your team for this one
my favorite character from the me isnt on your team which was probably the biggest disappointment to me
in fact your team has only  people to choose from unless you have dlc
then it is  compared to me this is a small flipping team
not just small but the only new alien type you get is from dlc only
they added another human of all boring flipping things but actually have fewer alien types on your crew than the other games
were there some racists who recently started working at bioware or somethingcontrolbefore i go on about the ai
and bad boss fights let me mention a few really bad changes from mass effect  that i dont understand
the powers you can use like warp singularity concussive shot whatever you use that make an arc from you to the enemy
these arcs are now different than in mass effect  in me you could aim a pretty decent distance away from an enemy causing your power to do a huge u shape arc that would make it get around any cover the enemy is hiding behind
this was awesome
in mass effect  you can only aim a few inches away from an enemy before the lock on goes away
so the arc you can make with your power is going to stay small looking more like a side of an oval than a circle
then at the last second the power thrusts toward the enemy very quickly
so the shape the whole arc makes is half oval then a diagonal slant toward the enemy
this means that usually your power will just slam into the cover the enemy is hiding behind failing completely
how funanother change from me is the aiming
it is mostly the same with one major difference that i am seeing in more and more games these days
there is an autoaim assist that is always on and you cannot turn it off
its not as pronounced in me as in many games ive played but that actually makes it worse
what it does is this say you are aiming your gun around an empty area
you move at a steady speed of lets say example
then an enemy walks into the area when your crosshairs get about  in game feet from the enemy on screen the speed of your aiming slows to about im not sure who in the world this helps
for me this just makes it so that i stop pulling to aim when i think i should be targeting the enemy only to find that the game slowed me down so now i am still a foot away from the enemy shooting the air
or if the enemy is on the move running left or right then the game keeps me from aiming at him because he is moving faster than the aim assist will allow me to aim
this is something i am seeing far too much in games with shooting and you cant turn it off
why not
what happened to the prexbox  era where every game had autoaim that you could turn on and offfightsi have already mentioned before the fights in me are the worst by far of the whole series
later on in the game there is a new enemy type and one boss who you fight multiple times who have swords and can go into superspeed virtually making them teleport around the room whenever they feel like it making them the most frustrating fights in the game
the very idea of this type of enemy makes me think bioware outsourced to crappy st person and rd person shooter companies and barely made any of this game themselvesill remind you here that in both me and me there were no enemies that were downright better than you
they might outnumber you
they might send a big robot or tank after you but there is no single humanoid before mass effect  that surpassed shepherds potential abilities and added more to them
but here comes mass effect  the sword boss i mentioned has adept powers that you can never learn is technologically advanced to go beyond your speed and power and leave you in the dust and has a sword and guns
you just have guns you cant go super speed so how you beat this enemy is basically cheap trickery luck and just spamming some of your best moves and running around like a crazy personthis game is full of examples of enemies that can do things you cant
early on there are the riot shields guys who can set up autoturrets throw infinite smoke grenades and have stun rods that nullify your shields
for some reason you are not allowed to use any of these things
then they throw in the swordwielding superspeed using ninjas
you cant use swords
the only melee you have is a little punch and a clumsy heavy melee that takes forever and gets you shot up while you do it
and you definitely cant go any faster than a normal human
now there is nothing wrong with games that make you fight superhumans by learning maneuvering and strategy normally a st person shooter
but mass effect was never one of these games
so why the heck did they think it was ok to change their own formula so drasticallyso i finished the game with a full paragon run imported from me
i dont know yet if the story would change much based on what i did in mass effect  if anyone has already done an evil run especially one where you imported from me having sided with the illusive man at the end of the game id be curious if the change is drastic
no spoilers please unless there really is no change from good guy run other than a few dialogues
im hoping for big changes like illusive man being on your side but i doubt itseveral nights have been spend going through biowares space opera since me  me
each iteration has been transformative to the video game media and spun an aweinspiring tale
mass effect  concludes that story and does so in style
the shooting mechanics have been improved many questions from the series are finally answer and the conclusion though originally underwhelminghas been fixed and polished with free dlc
dont miss out on the close to our favorite galactic epic of this console generationtruth be told
alot of the bad reviews for this game are knocking the entire experience making it sound like the game is completely worthless simply because of the last  minutes
im not defending the ending in any way
i hated the ending it made no sense to me and raised more questions than actually supplying answers
however it doesnt change the fact that i was on the edge of my seat for pretty much the entire time up to that point
no the ending isnt good but to say i didnt have fun playing the game and going with the  star protest is just ridiculous
a bad ending does not warrant criticizing the experience as a whole
they have of course announced the extended cut dlc news which will apparently clarify what happened in the end and hopefully it does in fact do that but im not getting my hopes up but until people see what this dlc has in store theres no reason for anyone to be giving an opinion on it
the mass effect trilogy for me was one of the most gripping and entertaining gaming experiences of this generation
a bad  minutes does not take away a fantastic  hours
im a serious gamer but also rational
if there were a better ending this would be a  star game no doubt
but i docked one star because the ending was indeed a letdown
the overall experience was great and im still a fan of the mass effect series and am ready for the next installment even if shepards story is overwhen i attended film school i noticed that my smart teachers stated the same thing even if your technical skill is flawless its completely irrelevant when your story is bad
almost everything depends on the script
in this case even the technical stuff is off
as i played me  i experienced one minor glitch and three major glitches which caused me to reload a save
in me  i experienced  glitchesin me  bioware failed us totally storywise so even the beauty of the graphics its usual good combat platform and great voice acting couldnt save it
i will try not to spoil the story as i outline some of their mistakes
there are mild spoilers thoughto me the first red flag was raised when i killed an alliance politician who was revealed as a traitor
although his role in the game was crucial to humanity and forming alliances with alien species the reaction to his death was muted
it was sort of meh
stuff happens
who cares
moving on there was almost no discussion about how his death would affect the alreadyfragile alliance between humanity and alien species andor how it might affect the overall plan to defend earth and other planets from the reapers
people basically said that they knew he was corrupt all along then moved along as if no one needed to fill that vacuum
no one was elected or appointed to replace him
also although aliens loved to bicker and try to seize power from humans during all of the me games even in times of galactic crisis evidently no other alien species tried to fill the vacuum seize power andor direct the movement to defend the galaxy themselves afterward
ummmm alrighti resented that in my particular story i was forced to kill three of my former crewmates and friends
shepard who was so good at finessing almost every bad situation in the previous games is suddenly forced to slaughter anyone who disagrees with him
and a flaw in the story is even revealed when i was forced to kill a character who dates back to the first mass effect game before he died the character informed me that he was tipped off by an informant in my crew
someone in my crew covertly recorded a conversation
later when i finished the game i realized that the informants identity was never revealed nor did heshe attempt to sabotage me again after that incident
bad bad and more badsome of your friends and even lovers just drop out of the picture completely and inexplicably
in my story i romanced jack in me  in me  she appears twice once during a mission then at a bar somewhere
during your final encounter with her you just dance with her then sit down
you explain that you still love her she states something like just wait until this is over then you never see her again
although miranda played a major role in me  she vanishes in a similar manner after you help her defeat a cerberus base
horrible stuff guysyou encounter a small child who dies at the beginning of the game
during most of the game shepard obsesses about him and dreams about him which seems ridiculous
of the millions of people who have died and the many friends he has lost he obsesses only about a kid with whom he spoke for less than two
minutes
right
i dont want to spoil the childs role but so many people have already commented about it so i will state that the child plays a hideously crucial role in determining the end of the game
as other people have noted he discusses the reapers role in the same manner that other people and the reapers themselves have explained their role
and its still idiotic and shepard still rejects it
yet the game assumes that a child is describing it so maybe it appears better
i have no ideathe ending is of course a complete and utter abortion
as other people have mentioned your decisions in the previous games ultimately result in almost nothing
the comrades who you collected in the previous games and me  are reduced to numbers
in the battle that leads up to the nonendingending abortion with the illusive man and the aforementioned child although you have united the alien species to fight with you you see only a couple of cut scenes with them fighting sidebyside
there isnt the sort of epic allied battle with comrades that you can experience in dragon age origins
there were people who i wanted to see in that battle such as the zhus hope colonists and their leader who i spared in me  nope theyre just a number  that is added to my war board assets
yet although i killed the rachni queen in me  she or a cloned version of her or something returned in the middle of the game and i was forced to battle the rachni again although i made the decision to kill her because i knew that such a thing would happenim not even going to describe the ultimate ending or whatever that nonsense was because so many people have already described its mass suckitude so well
i will just state that the macabre sight of zombie shepard and zombie anderson in a contrived and poorlywritten showdown with the illusive man we have martin sheen
we must base everything around him at the end even if it must blow because we have martin sheen
that ultimately justifies his worsethannazitactics is enough to ruin the entire trilogy in many or even most peoples minds
yes its that badughgreat game however not as good as the other too but i would still recommend it if you want to finish the series otherwise just play one and twodont need to expand much on the game the top review is very thorough
the gameplay of me is quite similar to me which is a good thing
i knew that people were disappointed with the ending before i started my me playthrough and i told myself that no matter what the ending was i couldnt be too disappointed since the game itself has been so fun to playboy was i wrongi cant even justify or rationalize my feelings i just know that the ending to me has completely killed my desire to finish my second playthough finished me again just prior to release of me
the entire series is built on choice and consequence
each chapter of the mass effect saga contains difficult decisions which you then see play out except in mass effect  there are decisions but no consequence
no epilogue no conclusion no closure
just the same ending that everyone else gets even if they played the game completely different than youprior to finishing mass effect  i wouldve told you that i could play me at least  or  times through because of the fun gameplay and the variety of options available
but after finishing me im not sure i will ever touch the series again because in the end it just doesnt matteri have played most of this game and what i played of it was great
i am starting to think while writing this that i might have to finish this game upyou can read anywhere else peoples thoughts on the single player experience of mewhen i first heard mass effect would add multiplayer i was worried we would get a tacked on experience that added little to the game eg tomb raider  far cry 
instead the class and weapon unlock system worked kinda like a collectible card game where items were given rarity statuses and you unlocked by playing more
it also helped that the multiplayer was as tight as the single playerlearning combos and powers was one of the best experiences ive had in the game
im glad i was there for the peak of the game but i know as of this writing may  that the servers are still populatedfirst off let me say i am not even going to talk about the ending since it has pretty much been talked to death alreadywhat i loved about the game was seeing all of the characters from me and me show up also they did a pretty good job on the combat
however i didnt understand why they mostly focused on combat when mass effect is suppose to mainly be a rpgwhat i didnt like was that they took out some of the characters i would liked to have on my squad like grunt wrex and miranda and stick you with a muscle head like vega
also it seemed like even though there were fewer characters you couldnt interact with them as much as you could in the last two games
the combat was good but the cover system sucks
even when i was hiding behind a full wall i was still getting shot
i also didnt like the quest log and the way they took out all the interaction with the quest givers
you mainly just run by and overhear a conversation and thats how you get quests
your quest log is pretty much a mess in this game and not like the last two where everything was nice and sorted
i was annoying with the planet scanning and reaper chase mini game
plus fighting the same mobs over and over again
the last two had variety like krogan asari turain  human as well as rachi
in this one it mostly felt like i was fighting cerbus and repear mobs over and over againthat is just a few of the things i didnt like about this game
i could go on but everyone has pretty much heard about how it didnt seem like mass effect at all and instead just a rush job
all in all i would just recommend waiting until the price drops and all this mess about the ending and dlc passes by before you buy this gameyou know that feeling you get after finishing a good book or watching the last episode of your favorite tv series
now imagine the ending leaves you heartbroken and thats basically how youll feel after completing the game however this should not discourage you from playing it
theres an old saying that the journey is more important than the destination and this game is a good example
even though the ending will probably leave you in tears of anger or sadness remains to be seen thats only the last  minutes or so of a  hour game
id say that  hours  minutes of pure unadulterated fun is worth that  minutes of weeping in the corner
this game is definitely worth more than the   stars its been given
the fact that such a big deal is made about the ending just shows how attached youll get to every aspect of this game
it will consume you heart and soul
only something truly grand will do that and this game is as grand as they comewhat i likeupdated power system
upped from four levels to six in terms of upgradeable skillsbetter graphics
the previous title was no slouch but this takes the cakegreat plot line
the ending could have been handled better but the storyline is still captivatingseamless control
like the previous games i very much like how the controls are laid out everything just fitswhat i dont likemining
unlike in the last installment you no longer need to mine resources
instead you locate war assets which is made difficult by the fact you have to constantly watch your backthe upgrade system
in this title you pay to upgrade your weapon max level  and can equip just two modifications
previously you could research an upgrade that would enhance all weapons of a certain type and you didnt have to choose just two enhancementslimited locations
unlike the last game where you could scan a planet and stumble upon a sidequest this game really gives you no reason to explore the galaxy beyond mining for war assets
plus you are limited to the citadel in terms of where to find shops
no illium tuchanka or omega type basesthis is a five star game but because it ripped my heart out im giving it four
but really its a five
just prepare yourself for emotional ruini have to say this was an amazing game and series i finished in  hours and did everything hours was not possible as i see itwhich is what they claimed
story was great ending could have been a bit better and i did finish feeling a bit empty
i wish you could have used more charactersi mean come on let me play with a krogen
i wish the kinnect feature worked but honestlyi tried and never got it to function as promisedif you turn off the sound off it works but if you are like me and have your stereo on while playing the kinnect there is to much background noise in order to work infact sometimes it will chose options you did not want
over all worth a rental or a buy then selli have played and loved the mass effect games since mass effect   great game great story great characters great interactions
i preordered mass effect  and had been anticipating it for a long time since mass effect   i started playing the game and loved it
great visuals great dialog ok  great but given the limits of the game the  that stumbles is easily forgivable
this game was supposed to bring closure to the series
the entire series was about choice and how your choices as the lead character actually matter and affect the ultimate ending
i played mass effect   times
i played mass effect   times
i fully expected to play and replay mass effect  at least a similar number of times importing variations of my character for each replay and trying different things out
the fighting is rock solid though difficult on a pc because they poorly ported it from a 
 console game and stuck your space bar with way too many tasks to handle well so it leads to some problems but still great gameplay great music great sound effects
then you get to the ending
the ending
one ending that varies ever so slightly among  choices
you go from a multitude of choices in me to me all supposedly cascading and building upon each other into three and then they all collapse into the same ending with  slight variations all of them bad
worse the ending is like a fever dream violates logic both in game and out of game and renders your every choice up to that point totally irrelevant
this game is to be played once and only once to a totally disappointing devastating for those of us who have come to know and love the series end
like many i cant even find any enthusiasm now to replay the previous  games becausewell whats the point
basically if you want to play this game wait until it is only  or so and buy it usedsecondhand
it is not worth   or higher
the collectors edition is an even worse waste of money
seriously
such potential and so many promises from the developer bioware all tossed in the trash along with any goodwill the fanbase once hadive played all three and all of them are greatoutstanding story should make a movie of this spectacular graphics inmmersive campaing  were decisions mattervoice  command is really a welcome feature during combat for strategic attacks must have a kinect for thisim not a game critic but these games are one of the best third person action rpg my own classification i guess out there
theres replay value on this brand were you can take several ways to the endhavent finish the game though so not sure if i will love this final chapter endinghighly recommended if you are looking for this type of genre with lenghty campaingmass effect  relies on drama nostalgia and improved gameplay to end the epic trilogy
it deserves to go down as one of the best scifi trilogies of our generation but its got a few issuesstory  throughout the story there is a dark sense of drama and an overt feeling of impending doom
reapers have invaded the galaxy and they are intent on wiping out all nonsynthetic organisms so all of the races you have encountered in me and me face genocide
the reapers begin their attack on earth and as the humans quickly realize theyre outmatched
lucky for us theres a halo device called the crucible that will destroy the reapers
commander shepard must assemble his crew and search the galaxy for allies for the war and engineers who can activate the crucible
cerberus is also after the crucible and theyre battling shepards crew along the way
on the quest shepard will make many difficult choices regarding who lives or who dies and some of these are painfulgraphics the characters and cutscenes are great
the environments are on par with me great but some are lacking a bit
the enemy designs and visual fx really bring the battles to lifegameplay the basic game flow goes like this  start on ship search galaxy map for quests fly there play a mission a battle in the unreal engine return to ship talk to characters about it repeatthe main quests are marked on the galaxy map
in order to begin one you just fly to the planet and land on it
from there you pick your squad
in a few story related missions one squad member is automatically chosen for you
you want to pick a squad that best combats the enemies youll be fighting or pick a character with biotic powers and another with mechanical powers to balance your squad
you can upgrade shepards armor to give him boosts to offense or defense and you can choose the guns for your squad members
shepard can carry up to  different gun types  pistol smg assault rifle shotgun or sniper rifle
but the heavier the combined weight of the guns the longer it takes for his powers to recharge
so do you want more firepower or more special powerseveryone levels up when shepard levels up and you assign points to all of the characters skill trees to unlock or boost their powersthe quests are usually battles similar to gears of war encounters
enemies charge you and you can use your weapons and powers to stop them
you can take cover behind objects and roll
at first the cover mechanic feels really strange
i found myself rolling by accident then pressing a to take cover then have it not work so i double tap a then shepard takes cover and jumps out of cover to get shot in the face and die
after a few battles i did get the hang of itthe guns do damage and the powers either debuff enemies attack them with a damage type summon a drone or get enemies to fight on your side
success in battle is largely determined by your aim and using the right powers against enemies
the game is pretty easy on normal mode and on the harder difficulties youll really need to strategically use the damage typespowers and weapons upgrading the powers is very simple
there are  levels of each power and  or  choices on each path
so you may unlock a biotic attack and for an upgrade you can choose to do concentrated damage to  enemy or have a wider area of effectthe guns are pretty bad
there are many weapons in the game and each can be upgraded  times
but it is really hard to tell which guns will best suit you
one frustrating thing is that you cannot see how one type of shotgun compares to the other shotguns while you are upgrading it
so you may have a cool shotgun that you like and then youll spend money to upgrade your new shotgun  times and realize its not as good as the one you are using
and theres no way to get your credits back
also some assault rifles are full auto while others are burst fire
it doesnt tell you this on the equip screen
there are just bar graphs on damage capacity fire rate etc  it would have been great to show the player the max attributes of a weapon in a different color on the bar grapheach gun can carry  modifiers that improve accuracy clip size weapon capacity etcthis helps you balance out the guns deficienciesone really nice feature is that shepard can earn reputation points by acting favorably with a crew member
once shepard does this he can add their powers to his own and upgrade them
so if tali likes shepard he can use her summon combat drone ability
if liara likes him he can use singularity
etcthe endings i dont want to spoil the ending so i wont talk about what actually happens
instead ill just point out the mistakes on a conceptual levelnote  my expectations were so low for the ending i thought commander shepard was going to slip on a banana peel fall out of an airlock then get probed by space monkeys
as he pounds on the glass space monkey giggles and uranus jokes are overheard while circus music plays in the backgroundthe war asset meterevery quest that you do fills this meter
there is a minimum line on it and thats pretty much it
you can also fill this meter by playing lots of multiplayer
it doesnt make sense but it sorta gives players a reason to try it
if you fill it all the way you get a very minor tweak to the ending but the game doesnt tell you that
most people just partially fill the bar by doing the main quests and thats itthe choicein the end you are presented with  choices
there is a blue switch a column of light and a red switch
but there is no confirmation on what switch does what or what happens when you jump into the light
the game really needed confirmation text pressing this will destroy the reapers
 option  option the way the ending was originally edited it was choppy and confusing
parts of it also made no sense and there was almost no mention of shepard a character that youve been playing for  years
in the extended versions they added some more scenes and some voice overs
theyre better but not greatbasically if you want to make an artsy ending or a cerebral ending that makes people think do it in an epilogue
make the regular ending a payoff
remember when luke skywalker blew up the death star
that was gratifying
that makes the audience feel good
mass effect s ending is confusing about how you get each one and when you see it it raises more questionssound the sound effects music and voice acting are awesomematurity mthis is rated m for sexual situations violence and language
its a lot like an rated r action filmreplay value  multiplayer you can play the game over and get different endings different romances and choose to ally yourself with different races
you can also play on the harder difficulties and try battling through the levels with different squad members
each pass through takes about  hours depending on the difficulty level and the number of side quests that you dofailsside quest logs  there arent any
if you meet someone at the citadel and they say i can help you if you find the lost artifact of gormic for me
you can search the galaxy and scan planets to get it
but when you find it you arent sure who needs it
you just find an artifact and you know someone that you met in the past wanted it
this game would have been better you could look up  artifact g  for fred citadel hospital so you didnt have to wander around as muchother fails i already noted  cover gun upgrades and triggering the endingoverall  flaws aside this is a really good game that is part of an amazing trilogy
the world that bioware created is incredible
all of the different alien races their cultures their religions and how they interact is mindblowing
it also makes you think about the human race in relation to the vast and infinite universe
the combat is fun and tactical the characters are memorable the story is dramatic  universal in scope and youll feel emotional about parts of it
sure this game could have been much better but overall its really goodbuy it if you love the series and please understand that the endings are betterbuy it if you love scifi and like themes about mans role in the universerent it if you have  hours for one play throughavoid it if you want a commander shepard centric endingavoid it if you didnt like the other games in the serieslike others im ticked off that there doesnt seem to be an ending to my game
i replayed the very end  different times because i thought surely i had chosen the wrong ending the one thats supposed to be bittersweet and never give you a conclusioninstead i was rewarded with the same scene three timesi did make the wrong choice though
i bought the game preordered instead of waiting for it to hit the  bargain binmany of the people who gave this game bad reviews dont seem to appreciate the game for what it truly was
mass effect since the first one was always an rpgshooter hybrid whose gameplay has been compared to that of gears of war rather than the mindless boring and repetitive recent cod games
i absolutely love this game and i am currently on my rd play through since i havent unlocked all the achievements
the collectors edition was hands down worth every pennyfor anyone who hated the ending that is your problem most people expected it to happen anywaysfor those who flamed the galactic readiness feature and claim its not possible to get the neutral or good ending clearly did something wrong
it is very easy to get either ending without ever having to resort to the multiplayer
i did and i had a readiness value of  in my second playthrough without ever touching the multiplayer  i would love to start playing the mp but my live gold membership expired and i havent gotten around to renewing the graphics story and overall combat is exciting and immersive enough to keep a person entertained fully for a few daysi will admit however that there were a few times when the game did lag heavily or frame but i believe this was a problem for all platforms my brother owns it for his pc and his pc is pretty highspec yet still gets some frame issues
even friends of mine who have it for ps said it occurred a lot for them
so maybe sometime a patch could fix this regardless it is something i can ignoreone last thing i should mention and i wont call it a con but it upset me to some extent my first playthrough was to experience the default story without use of my previous saves and what i did find that annoyed me was that my favorite characters who i expected to run several side missions and main story objectives were dead
yes deadanyways i have run out of things to say for the time being but i highly recommend that everyone should play this series
it has evolved quite a lot from the first one and it does sadden me that the series has come to an endgreat way to end a story i prefer how it ended then how fans demanded
hero dies for peace in the galaxy who cant like that ending apparently ever person other than me
great graphics with in depth game play
also first mass effect to have multiplayer which is really fun
fun game really good space story gamemass effect  was a good gamemass effect  was a great game
mass effect  is a complete snoozefestthe goodvoice acting art direction and music
the disappointingmass effect  has been dumbed down way to much
exploration is nearly nonexistent think final fantasy xiii and the length of actual missions once you are out of the initial linear corridor are severely shortened
the whole game feels like a lazy screen writers todo checklist than an interactive adventurethe badi have ran into no less than three glitches during different missions that require reloading the previous save  autosave to activate a scripting trigger allowing the game to progress
two glitches when coming out of cutscenes where cmd
shepard takes a fixed snowangel stance and is unable to select weapons shoot or use powers sliding around like a stand up snowangel is rather humorous thoughthe lazyrendering glitches like degree rotated heads missing heads and disjointed  bent backwards fingers arms and legs are just lazy programming now that we are in the third and final sequel
the lack of attention to the volume of voices is unforgivable
it is often impossible to hear what some npcs you directly talking to are saying but the ones that are having semirandom conversations as you walk by overpower everything in the soundtrackthe conclusioni have yet to finish mass effect  just started the cerberus assault mission and i can say that the only reason that i have pushed myself this far is that i want to see how this series ends but from what i have heard  read even that sounds to be a huge disappointmenteven for those that want to see how it ends i would wait for this to hit the bargain bins or at the very least pick it up usedthis game was awful
most people gave it a high positive rating for playability and two stars or less for the ending
i beg to differ
to quick sumpro combat slightly more challenging than me which was a cakewalk far less scanning of planets a huge plus
jamescon less squad members
team from me totally broken up
what the heck
james is a great heavy but he does not make up for my smaller and less versatile team
miranda not on team
only a complaint from my perspective since she was my love interest in previous game
her low involvement in the story and absence from my squad really horked me though
i spent half the game waiting for the chance to add her to my team and was very unhappy when i realized it wasnt happening
almost no neutral options
every choice gives you paragonrenegade points
this makes it impossible to play a really pure renegadeparagon
in the previous installments you could always go neutral if your paragon or renegade choice seemed bad or silly
most of the time it didnt really matter anyway
now almost everything you say or do gives paragon or renegade points
you cant save certain allies without going paragon
you cant disagree with certain tactical decisions without going renegade
very frustrating
biggest problem of all
fetch quests
thats all most of your allyresource gathering amounts to
go to citadel
get mission from random hobo on street
go to systemplanet
scan
go back to citadel and give hobo what you found
get new armyfleetupgradewar material in exchange
rinse
repeat
puke
it would be less crappy if you actually got some boots on ground missions
but next con less boots on ground exploration
much less
short
finish in a weekend of fairly dedicated play
by contrast i could geek out on other games for at least a couple of weeks
now i suppose id get nickle and dimed with dlcif the game was interesting enough to pay for that
hint it isnt
on xbox not sure about other platformscomputer to disc game
constantly having to switch between discs while playing
for what you actually get in the game i have a hard time seeing why i need to switch between discs again and again and again
the ending
oh lord the ending
its an insult
it doesnt even make sense spoiler what the hell is joker doing in an alien system at the end
wasnt he in the battle over earth like two minutes before that
when did my other squadmembers who were fighting with me or leading other assets on the ground suddenly get onboard the normandy
did they beam up star trek style
poorly thought out crapi really could go on
this game is not worthy of the mass effect name
im sure some stuff will be altered or added to in dlc but when i shell out  bucks i want a good game now not later at additional cost
i wont be bothering with this game any further
very disappointing as the end of a series i really loved and was heavily into
not recommendedthe game is awesome
the series is amazing
laugh at the whiners and then play this gem and then laugh at them some more i only paid  for the game
so for that price alone and the  hours of entertainment it provided me it doesnt suck since i didnt spend the last  years of my life thinking plotting planning discussing developing writing producing directing drawing coloring animating programming editing testing managing composing music  arranging music recording music singing songs praticing localizing doing voice over work translating designing creating visual effects special effects sound effects strategy guides financing marketing promoting shipping distrubuting selling stressing wondering wishing dreaming and hoping that the mass effect series will be a success im not gonna talk crap about it at all
im just gonna do what my sister tells me to do if i get into her car and start complaining about her driving
she tells me to just shut up kick back and enjoy the ride
so im just gonna shut up kick back enjoy and appreciate every bit of the years of hard work that many people spent working on this game in order to get it into my hands and just consider myself lucky that i got a chance to play it
since i dont have any technical skills to create a video game and dont have a company to produce promote and sell a video game either imma just say good job to the team at bioware who put this game together
well done
so for this reason too it doesnt suck most rpgs come from japan and while japanese rpgs are extremely good i wish theyd stop cluttering up the entire screen during battles with a menue system
for example final fantasy  uggghhh
im sick and tired of fighting in the menue system and having to constantly access it in order to do something
it takes away the fun of playing the game
the japanese need to learn from western type rpgs and not over complicate the game play as games like fable and mass effect have already figured out and are now doing
now does this mean that gameplay should be dumbed down
no
i dont think that gameplay should be dumbed down to just simple button mashing so that a person with the attention span of a pineapple can enjoy playing it
i just wish that what i see on screen isnt constantly blocked by too much words  numbers that really dont mean anything to me
visually i wanna appreciate what i see on the screen without words and numbers getting in the way
so since mass effect  doesnt over complicate their battle system it does not suckand so for these  reasons mass effect  does not suckit was a great ending to an epic video game trilogy
it mixed in new and old characters and always seemed to have extra twists and turns
hugely disappointing ending choice thoughadded  first  you must play this game at least two times
play once then play around  multiplayer games
then play it again
why
youll learn to use your powers wont overload with unneeded or underused weapons and play much better
plus you can make different choices and open up new avenues of exploration and new dialogs
plus you just may play new character types
i always went with soldier because of the weapon types
now i almost exclusively use sniper rifles and handguns so can try other character types
plus you can keep an eye out for clues to the ending  there are several
at one point liara asks if shepard had ever thought about what would happen if the relays were destroyedgameplay fun great sound nice cinematics
there were a few times when the game took control for preset encounters where shepard and whomever he was talking to were in really awkward positions  looking over their shoulders in opposite directions bumped up against walls etc
the battle with the harvester where shepard had to laser paint the reaper  the final scene froze the game three timesweapons some fun new cool toys
the graal spike thrower shotgun is a blast as is the scorpion  i find myself using the scorpion the most
its just fun to watch the baddies explode into gory piles of goo
or shatter
the mods are a welcome return and the way they are implemented is pretty much like dead space  you need a weapons bench
unlike dead space they are all over the place including the normandyammo plentiful
i never ran out  sure my assault rifle may go dry but i could switch to another weapon
youll find ammo all over the place including spare grenadesexploration not as rewarding as previously or as in say bioshock
if i wander around and explore every nook and cranny i want to be rewarded
only happens occasionally here
you have to explore to find mods and upgrades but it should be more rewarding
more credit stashed perhaps
the dlc does have more stuff stashed around the placeparagonbadazz dude i really wish the text choices we were given matched what shepard actually said or does
often they seem opposite or nonsensical
sometimes they are obvious  highlighted in red or blue
most times they are notkilling people off why
some deaths were pointless
wont get into details but youll find yourself with several wtf
momentschoices results are often nonsense
theres a point where you have to select between two races
pick race a and race b will try and destroy them  race b gets wiped out
this is idiotic  theres no reason for race b to make this choice
sleep with person a and person b gives you the could shoulder  even though theres no way she could have knownbattles most are pretty good not overly challenging
there was one no win battle  it took me a few tries to realize this and change the goal from killing them all to finishing the mission
the solo fight with the reaper i mentioned earlier  pretty sillydlc so far the only dlc is the first day release
you can skip it
there was about  minutes of game play and the character was not that great
if it was free or   but not movement its a little quirky
shepard tends to spin around too much and its a little tricky to align him with people just right so he interacts
you get the hang of it eventually but it should not be that quirky
the runningshootingduckingjumping is much refined and a blastbattle center never went above  readiness
i collected  of the junk lying around the galaxy completed all but  of the side missions and those were minor and had my forces maxed outother quirks when our ninja assassin goes after the prothean ai the ai announced indoctrinated presence detecting and declares that defenses are activated
nothing happens
another character im staying generic to avoid spoilers  i had himher make a choice
we find out hisher eventual fate later on
again lame
makes no sense
the character was asked are you xxxx  the character answered yes and was shot
why would you answer yes
why not hide  there were plenty of places  and lots of time
the writers seemed determined to kill off anyone shepard interacted with in the previous games
when you have the final showdown with the elusive man well lets just say he was way too easy to deal withending i agree with the other reviewers
it seemed sloppy and contrived
again its too black and white
the two choices given are bizarre
first time through i chose the leftgood blue option because i saved the species involved
ill play it again but ill select to save different species during gameplay and pick the rightbad option
i dont know why they consider one good and the other bad  the results of the good option are pretty dramatic and the final wrapup set far in the future is bizarre
it assumes no advances in space travel  really
with all that reaper tech lying around
theres plenty of controversy about the ending  one i find diabolically clever if true
if you decide to control the reapers you are actually indoctrinated by themthe final screen basically an ad to buy dlc so you can continue shepards legacy
really
i played  hours for an advertisementoverall it was fun to play and it did recognize choices from the previous games i saved the rachni did not blow up the harvester base etc
oh yea  ever wonder what a prothean sounds like
a rastafariannd playthrough you start out with the basics as in the first playthrough and little cash
but as soon as you start collecting weapons youll have cool upgraded versions
i upgraded all my weapons to level v  highest available
picked up a rifle  and it was instantly at level vi
as soon as i was able to switch out weapons i had access to all my previous playthrough weapons  but not the mods  but the mod effects i had chosen previously were in effect
once i found some mods all mods from the previous playthrough were there
i was awarded around  once i hit the citadel
im intentionally making different choices than the previous playthrough
its almost like a different game
i have two more additional people on my team choices
ive seen at least  minutes of new video
several new missions
coolmuntiplayer a blast although it is a bit of another money grab on the part of bioware
to really survive in the multiplayer game you need supplies and upgrades
you can earn credits by playing or just spend  for them
you need to visit the store for supplies and can spend from  to  for supplies  and purchase several at a time
or spend  to  game credits
bioware is making a fortune from this and i feel a bit reamed
you should be able to pick up these items in the game  not pay for them
aside from that gameplay is more fun than gow
ive tried all the classes and have settled on a human engineer
that combat drone has a deer in the headlights effect on brutes husks and most importantly bansheesmy biggest complaint ea servers keep going down
happens every three or so games
any credits real money or earned ingame you spend on consumables are then gonei loved the game the story the gameplay the erotic scenesand the upgrades of both sheperds powers and his weapons
the multiplayer is a four man cell team surviving  waves of enemies
it is fun and when you play enough its just like getting money from your parents and buying a pack of playing cards
what i mean is the multiplayer lets you earn credits and with these credits you can buy booster packs for your multiplayer character
the pack can consist of new weapons character appearance mods weapon upgrades power upgrades ammo upgrades new weapons and new weapons mods
i find myself playing the multiplayer game and making new friends with itit was absolutely amazing until the end
i am posting this review strictly to lower the rating because i am so upset about the laziness involved with the ending
i hope they do something to fix this
otherwise they may have lost another dedicated fan since the beginninga great game for the most part throughout
i do have some minor gripes about enemies gameplay and lack of creativity with characters returning from meme with them still wearing the same attire from last game
the game made it feel like it was building to a massive conclusion
obtaining war assets is a mindless task for the most part but it felt like it was going to payoff in the endultimately though it is the end that fails miserably for one of my favorite franchises of all time
i felt like i had to write this because of how much love i have felt for the franchise and the characters that didnt get a proper conclusion
there are many reviews about it so i wont go into great detail but i had to put my  cents in
great game great franchise but one of the worst endings in the history of endingson a side note though the mp is fun
i do enjoy it quite a bit
i wont play through the entire game again because the ending was so bad but the mp has added some replay value for mei am just not a huge fan of this type of rpg
i like the story elements but the rpg side of these series of games has gone down the toilet
it took me several months on me ii to get into the game enough to finish it
for me it was a huge step backwards
they took out the exploration portion and placed your toon in a corridor and added some cut scenes and fights here and there to the story arc conclusion at the end
the third in the series has taken this to the next step and reduced much of the content to move a little bit shoot some baddies etc
etc end and debrief
i just cant really get into it
why not just watch a movie instead
i loved skyrim and those types of games and i wish they would do a version in space that was more of a sandbox instead of the theme park trend that the me series has gone downthe graphics and sound is good i didnt mind the new talents and leveling process but i just had a hard time getting through it
in the first game i could play for hours second one maybe a mission or two if they seemed good
on this one i had a hard time completing one mission in a play session
its so scripted nothing you do matters a whit
the ending was a let down as well though i really dont care as much about that in i wish the game itself had more depth to ittoo bad too the series started off so wellgreat game
see my review for the pc version
the multiplayer is tons of fun as well and keeps me coming back for more
i really enjoy all the free extra content theyve created for the game
the variety of character and powers are great
as are the great variety of equipment
really love multiplayer almost as much as the single playerwhat can i say this is one of the best rpg out there im a big fan of the mass effect universe its immersive addictive and full of surprises i strongly recommend you to play this with a imported shepard
i played it like  times two with a new character and the las two with an imported me me shepard the experience was completely different the choises i made took effect in meby the way the ending is good see it for yourselffirst of all this is not a bad nor average game
the only thing the only thing that sucks about this hit is the ending
i understand how some may beat it down and feel letdown  but we have to be fair
the controls story graphics gameplay everything is awesome
if you like the others you will enjoy this one
just be prepared to not like the ending
too bad because this is my favorite trilogy and game series this console generation
but dont let that stop you from experiencing this game
 stars 
wowface it you played the first two games so youre not going to pass this up because someone says the ending sucked
this is a great franchise and a great game
when i ordered this from amazoni started replaying the st two games to get prepared
i played all  games back to back and was never bored for a moment
i for one didnt have a problem with the ending
i had too much fun with the journey
i plan to play a couple other games and restart this trilogy as a renegade and play to the endingthis review contains no spoilersby now most people who have played mass effect  have come to have a problem with ending of the game and not without reason
however i think to be fair the first  hours of gameplay cant be ruined by the last  minutes or so
it does feel like a misstep though
while playing there are a lot of inside jokes and references to things from the past two games and quite a bit of time is devoted to really fleshing out your past crew members and some of the important choices you have made in the past two iterationsi say some of the choices because when certain choices are addressed in the game it felt to me like bioware tried really hard to whittle down the possible cut scenes while also trying to provide the backstory to those choices for people who have not played mass effect  or  if you have played dragon age you will know what i mean
like where no matter which dialog option you choose you will get the same response from whoever you re talking to because it is worded in a vague way where it makes sense regardless of what you say and the only difference is whether what you chose to say affects your standing with that character in a positive or negative way
however because we should be able to feel like our choices have mattered those generic expository reactions from your allies feels really out of place
for instance i chose to save the rachni queen in mass effect  then when it gets brought up in game  shepard asks the rachniarent they extinct
and all the while i am thinking come on shepard dont you remember effing saving them in game  why are you asking such a stupid question
it breaks down my suspension of disbelief where i should be engaging with the story and if i had a complaint that would be the biggest one
there are a few instances of things like that and while i completely understand why bioware did it that way i think they could have done it better
if someone is going to pick up game  without playing the first two they should have to read codex entries to catch up and give the devoted fans a unique gaming experience instead of a generic onesizefitsall cinematic that falls flat
while you can definitely argue its merits in terms of story and gameplay alpha protocol did an excellent job of creating a unique experience every time you played it
in fact i dont think i could do two identical playthroughs of it if i actively tried
and that is because all of your choices do matter
i think one of the problems with mass effect  isnt that your choices dont matter at all its that they dont matter very much
its a bit too late to go back and fix it now though unless they redid the entire game
that is wishful thinking on the part of fans of the series
i think we are going to just have to try to make peace with what we haveso i guess i should also talk a bit about the ending without spoilers
it seems to be quite convoluted to me
and what it really feels like is that there was about  minutes of cutscenes that were removed from the ending and im not sure why
i think that is the second reason what people really feel like their choices dont matter that much because were not really shown anything that can bring closure and tie the game off nicely
and a minor annoyance to me was that the continuity of your squad members sometimes gets all screwed up
like you choose your squad at the end and then after you complete the game you see a cutscene and both of the ones i chose were in it and i was just like werent they with me down on the planethowever to be fair the game it does a lot of things right and because of that i dont think its fair to dismiss the game or give it one or two stars just because the ending was weak
as with fable  i enjoyed the vast majority of the game until the ending but just because the end of both games left me wanting more i cant call the games bad and disregard all of the things they did well
and mass effect  did a lot of things well even for its shortcomingsthe tone is set right away and it is very effective
clint mansell scored the game and it is gorgeous
very dark but with moments of raw emotion
the opening of the game will be nothing new to those who played the demo since it is essentially the same thing only with more dialog options and a longer cutscene
as with the end of mass effect  game  does a superb job of setting up that this is really it and things are looking very bleakyour past crew members are all revisited and are all given a generous amount of time so that we understand them better and care about them more
all of the instances are pretty effective and i even found myself caring about what jacob had been up to even though i still find him to be very flat and uninteresting
but besides that there are a few cutscenes devoted entirely to having emotionally engaging moments with your crew
i think bioware didnt have to do that and im a bit surprised they did
but i also think the game is fantastic because of it
that is why you are fighting this seemingly hopeless war to protect that kind of camaraderie
a few new minor characters are even introduced and they are all quite goodthe gameplay is very smooth and the action while i still felt there was an excess of it is streamlined
i had a few problems with my character either moving into or coming out of cover when i didnt want them to but other that that i didnt experience any problems
i think this is also the most difficult mass effect game to date
i played on insanity the first time through and i died quite a few times
there were segments of game  that i thought were difficult but mostly those were boss battles
in this game there were numerous times where i felt overwhelmed just by normal fights
and maybe thats why i felt like there was too much action you dont need to have constant action to have an engaging story bioware
 because most of it was difficultthe graphics are an upgrade from the second and it looks really good
everything seems darker and more defined now but because the story is also pretty dark i think it helped reinforce the tone
graphics should never take center stage though so thats all ill say about them is that they look nicereferences to the past two games are numerous and to me having played both of them multiple times were very welcome
bioware even breaks down the third wall a couple of times and pokes fun at themselves
and its really good to see that a developer can look at choices they made in the past and see how it might not have worked like they wanted it to but also not get all defensive about it and dont mind a little selfdeprecating teasingi have not played as female shepard yet so i cant speak to her voice acting but i actually didnt mind male shepards voice acting this time through
its never been bad per se just flat and boring
this time i didnt notice much of that which is good because its one of those things that can constantly be disengaging you from a game if youre spending the time rolling your eyes at how lines are delivered or written sometimesas unfulfilled as some people may feel at the ending i dont think the rest of the hard work on this game can be discounted fairly
tens of thousands of man hours went into making this game and most of the work was superb
while i am part of the group that feels like the ending should have been different or had different choices i cant give this game a low rating just because that  of the game was weak
it is an important  no question but we really cant always have what we want
and in terms of enjoyment ratio i genuinely loved about  of the game
and while i feel that is entirely the right of anyone else to give the game a low rating because of the ending i choose to focus on the overwhelming reasons the game is incredible in spite of the endingi absolutely love this series to death
except that like most of everyone else the ending is just not good at all
soooo much is missingthe whole game felt small sooo quick i felt cheated out of the  i spent plus the dlc i boughtim sad that things ended this way and that all that time invested has been wastedthe game itself is fun but like so many have said before its the ending that is a huge let down
its not even the actual ending that happens its the lack of endings that i find to be the problem
if the true ending was just one of the many endings it wouldnt of been a big deal at all but it is the only ending
one ending for a game about choices so basically your choices dont matter and it doesnt change anything in the end
i really dont understand how bioware could let this happen
they have such a good rep and now all fans will be questioning if the games they put out will be worth investing in
this series was excellent a truly beautiful gaming experience until the end
i think we all no what that means like watching a really great movie but the ending sucks well that makes the whole movie suck
its the same here
whats the point in playing the games over if there is only one ending
very disappointing
game of the year just went to failure of the decadethis game just arrived and my son is still playing i did get to play just a little before his friend came over
they are having a blast
game is great mass effect cant believe this is the last game
maybe i can play it when he goes to school tomorrow and write another reveiw of my own
game is very detailed and i like how they give the kids a choice of what to dolisten ive loved the mass effect games since the first one came out in   i loved it so much i got my cousin to track down a copy of the collectors edition so i could have it proudly sitting on my shelf
this is a game series that allows you to mold the universe to what you want it to be
your commander shepard is yours in looks gender and actions
i was beyond excited for the final installment of the trilogy to come out and even took  days off work to play
the beginning of mass effect  sets up a dark tone for the game
you have to make some of the most gut wrenching decisions ever and there isnt always a clear right or wrong path to take as in previous mass effects
everything comes to a climatic head when most of your plans have started falling apart on the battlefield and you have one last ditch effort to take to save earth and the universe with her
the ending of the game is a bit of a sore spot with me still
while the game does a great job up until the end of finishing up various storylines that have gone on since the first game to giving closure to certain characters stories
the ending instead leaves a lot of new questions to be answered because the choices you are given for the ending are not the best in the world literally
heres the thing while the various endings of the game definitely left me feeling disappointed they dont take away from the fact that mass effect  is an outstanding game and shines the brightest of all in the trilogy
while i understand there is anger and outrage in the fan community because of the end that doesnt mean the game deserves the amount of review bombs its getting
i would still highly recommend this title and my best advice is to do yourself a service and play all  games if you can to get the whole rewarding experiencethis game ruined a great series i wasted my money buying it and only plated once this game is awful ending all  the same lol no choice
i give the game a  i am done peordering games
this is an ea money grad to there no point to the game everyone dies and the fleet is left to die in earth orbit from starvation well unless you buy the future dlcthe mass effect series is one of my favorite series i have ever played
i love the story the character interactions the missions etc
this is truly a great series finale
each installment has gotten bigger and better
there are a ton of missions and side quests in the installment probably as many as the first two games combinedstory the reapers have invaded earth and the galaxy
it is up to you to rally up all the species for one final showdowngameplay action rpg and rd person shooter similar to the previous two installments
you traverse the galaxy using your spaceship
you can walk around your ship the citadel other planets etc
while in your ship you can explore solar systems
this includes scanning planets and launching probes to gather information and supplies
the only difference in this game is the scans can attract the reapers so you have to leave the solar system before they catch you
you can interact with all of your party and most of your crew
the main missions include every species we have seen throughout the series including the krogan salarians turians geth asari quarians etc
all while battling the elusive man and cerberus and the reapers
you have to resolve conflicts and get as many species on board to help the final confrontation against the reapers
while on missions the gameplay turns into a rdperson shooter with multiple weapons and a cover systemconclusion while i know there is lots of frustrated gamers and controversy surrounding the ending of the game i do not believe that has any affect on the rating of this game
the story is still great and although the extended cut dlc did improve the ending a little for me i dont think it was needed
i couldnt come up with a better ending myself that solved all the problems
i mean this is not as simple as one of those the good guys win scenarios
there are consequences to every outcome of the battle and no one ending is going to satisfy everyone
the gameplay is incredible the missions the dialogue the conflicts cerberus it all adds up to a great game
i truly felt the weight of the galaxy as i played through this gameim soooo disappointedupdated as stated by others i am a me me game importer
luckily some of my games imported correctly  of my  me games dont show up as importable options
after that however all down hill
all my squad members from  are basically cameos and only a few from  are playable and the real kicker is some get killed off and you cant pick who survives ie
kiss mordin thane miranda legion  and most likely tali goodby
yep thats wanted by fans kill off the characters we love after we cant even play them anymore thats real nicei have seen all  endings  distinct endings if you consider a nuance difference a distinction all of which are just different representations of the same  cut scene
the differences boil down to lighting differences and the number of squadmates that step off the busted normandy at the endvoice acting is on par but the dialog scripts are out of place and the script in general seems like it was piecemeal loading screens are hacked you have to switch between disc  and  so often it hurtsi am not typically a fan of multiplayer but i am enjoying this games multiplayer if i forget about the ea store and how evil that whole concept is
basically you need to buy stuff in the store for credits or cash
if you choose not to spend cash you will be waiting for a long time between good gear
many of the items you get in the store are single equip items
that means that after you use them on one mission they are gone time to spend more moneywithout a new ending i am so over this series because of this gamei recommend waiting until this game hits  or bioware changes the ending before getting it save your moneyupdateranti agree with those saying you ought to play it when you can get it for less than  bucks or they drop a free dlc to correct the busted ending
this is by far the greatest of the three games insofar as continuous closure to existing open ideas from the first two games and  the mechanics are great
but when you get to the ending wow it couldnt be more abstract and meaningless
dont let bioware get away with this i bet they intended to change the ending all along that means with the day one dlc and a paid new ending dlc the standard edition of this game will weigh in at  for a compete product
that is not fair and ought not stand with fansupdate i cannot in good conscious raise my review score at this point bioware has clearly stated that they no longer think their fans matter they have therefore just lost one in mesimply google mass effect  extended cut it will be the top hitfrom the bioware blogso there you have it
are we proud of the game we made and the team that made it
hell yes
are we going to change the ending of the game
no
do we appreciate the passion and listen to the feedback delivered to us by our fans
very much so and we are responding
me had the hammerhead that you had to take down to a planet to explore and find crashed probes and then there was a mini game to unlockretrieve the thing in the probe that was my favorite way to get resources exploration  because driving around in a cool tank and looking for stuff on a new planet is funme had you scanning every planet in every system looking for anomalies and resources when you found an anomaly you were in luck mini mission
there were still mini games hack and bypass to unlock stuff
that still rocked and the mini games in me were better in my opinion but i really missed the hammerhead and all the exploration that went along with it still a strong game and a close second to the first game in my bookin walks me rpg no mini games at all all of the exploration is reduced to hitting the trigger in a system until the reapers show up and chase you away then you need to do a mission and go back and try again blah
this game is the an example of everything me and me were not and that is a very bad thing for many of us who loved the first game and what it exemplifiedi am sadyeah it is how i feel
imagine your mom gave you a puppy for your birthday and three years later said  enough is enough lets end this trilogy  and crack just broke his neck
i would feel like i suddenly got disconnected from reality a very bad trip in progressi loved me  i cared about my shep and my squad i tried to be so freaking upright and save as many as i possibly could
and for frigging what
i dont know may be bioware made such an ending and essentially there is only one for a shock value but i really dont appreciate when all my efforts in the game just went down the drain
it is a freaking psychological abuse of fans  first you set certain expectations and enforce certain feelings and then suddenly crash them
i did not want to write a review a game till last  minutes deserves  stars but this ending thing should be punished and my  star review is a small contribution i can makejust finished playing the game i thought it was fantastic
the multiplayer part annoyed me a little to have it hooked into single player but i felt the game was strong enough to overcome all that and in the end i actually had fun with multiplayer
the ending was just ok but the overall game kicks assthe entire pitch of this game was that our decisions mattered
they did not
this game has as linear of an ending as they come its extremely disappointingmass effect  is the biggest video game  let down i have experienced in years
my excitement for the game was insane and the end result was nothing short of hilarious
i spent over  hours and over  on this franchise and i am very angry
this game is a let down from start to finish
the game does not have enough dialogue options you dont get to explore big interesting area you are either in a battle or on the citadel
side quests are awful and i mean god damn awful you acquire side quests by wandering like an idiot on the citadel and eavesdropping on peopleseriously
whats wrong with plain old talk to the npc way
and worse side quests are not kept in a nice organized way in your journaland you dont get to mark a side quest as active eitherand you dont get info on where to go or what to doyou have to recall what the conservation was when you automatically acquired itand a lot of side quests expire if you dont do them quicklyughand dont get me started on the endingits beyond bad
i am open minded when it comes to ending i can take tragic happy or anywhere in between
but this gameits just terribleit does not make any senseits totally against what the series has been aboutand you have almost no control over what occursisnt mass effect series about choices and consequences
my shepard would never do what i saw him do on the screeni just watched helplessly in horrorits sadreally sad
there was a time when i associated the brand bioware with qualityi used to buy their games without even a single review because i knew how good they are
now dont get me wrong every dev make a bad game or twoand this is biowares second fall after daand what really angers me is that they are choosing to make their games awful by being lazy da and ridiculous me
therefore whatever biowares next game is they will have to earn my moneyokay maybe you didnt like the ending but there is no way you can justify giving this game  star
its some of the highest quality work in the gaming industry i have ever seen
i wasnt happy with the ending either but it by no means ruined the entire  hour mass effect trilogy
also bioware are actively listening to your feedback whining and are going to adjust the game to satisfy everyone so shut up will youokay now that thats over with mass effect  is the best game in the series
the gameplay has been refined to incorporate the best elements of the first two games while adding some new twists that really improve the experience
biotics feel more powerful weapons more responsive and upgrades are more rewarding
the graphics are noticeably improved
facial animations are much more realistic
the storytelling is flawless throughout
it no longer feels like paragonrenegade choices and more like two or more right answers that have a downside
youll be scratching your brain and trembling with fear as you decide what to dolook its a good game
the production values are astonishing it plays well the acting is good the music is good and its fun to play
it doesnt completely stick the landing at the end but that doesnt mean its not worth playingthe multiplayer is actually pretty funthe actual game is exceptional
its the right lenght great graphics excellent gameplay ok story a little restrictive the problem is i cannot play this damn gamethere is a bug for xbox users that makes the game unloadable with your xbox gamertag
fortunately for me i beat the game in like  weeks before this problem arose
if you dont believe me just google mass effect  black screen of death
this problem has been since the game has launched
buyin this game as a xbox owner is like russian roulette
your copy may decide not to work after a few days few weeks or it might have no problems at all
the manufacturer has yet to fix this problem
from thomas abrham bioware moderator hey everyonethis issue is still a top priority of ours and we are still investigating it
if the most recent patch has fixed this issue for you could you please pm me as well if it reverts to the bsod please inform me as well
this is from april   months agoso if u want to roll the dice for a  coaster go right ahead
the game is great when it did playthe ending is not as bad as all the nerds say it isi bought this game right when it came out
it had good reviews from the mainstream media and i liked me and me
i played those games over and over again picking different decisions to see how it affected my game
this is the whole point of an rpb roll playing game
i paid full price but now i wish i would have waited and bought it on sale or used
this game is not worth full price
a lot of people have talked about the endings and yes that is the main problem with the game
but i have played a lot of games with poorly written endings and have still liked the game
unfortunately with this game it only emphasizes that most of the game is pointless and makes the replay value close to zerofirst off the game is short ish hours
to me this is a tad pricey when there are other games on the market with  for the same price
there are not a lot of side quest were you are part of the action
a lot of the side quest is scanning planets for war assets
this on its own would have ok because you are let to believe that everything you gather will help in the end
well it does not
and you feel like a fool spending hours gathering scanning and searching for every asset for well nothing 
second there is a magic number of ready points dont even get me started on this you need to hit for all the available endings and by all i am talking about the one with the slight variations
this can be made up if you missed any scanning or side quests with the use of multi player not what you do in game
this leaves a big part of the game pointless to playthird noting matters in the end
whatever i did from games  up to the last  or so makes no difference in the end
its only your ready score
i just played a single player rpg and the only difference in the ending is based on a score that i can play multiplayer to make up
and to rub salt in the wound the endings are almost the same so play through again or with different imports is almost meaningless
i planned on play  different imports to see how the ending changed something that was a marketing highlight but well its pointless nowso for me not worth the price and does not have a high replay valuewith that said
it is a fun game and if you are a fan of the me games you will love it just dont play the last  or so
you have to use your imagination anyway for the end yes this is even what the writers said they wanted so best start once you hit earth and save yourself the painmy recommendation yes buy the game it i as fun until the last  game but not at full price
buy it on sale or used
i wish i did
and dont trust the mainstream media 
there are some major flaws in this game none were pointed out in the prerelease reviewsi have played probably  hours or so and the game is awesome
i dont know how some of these guys have finished it already makes me wonder if they dont have a life or no job
the game is great it pulls you in a never lets go
i havent played the multiplayer only the sigle player because im curious how its all going to endim on the fence about whether or not i like games that feel like youre playing a movie but in this case they pulled it off and the result was phenomenal
i appreciate the fact that a lot of people were upset by the game ending choices but i dont understand taking an excellent game with great graphics great mechanics amazing story and few or no bugs that will entertain you for probably  hours and giving it a poor rating because you dont like one of several ending choices they give you
if you factor in that there is no intended direct sequel to this then i really dont understand it
if you bought a car you thought was amazing but you didnt like the seats in the car would it suddenly become a pos
if you play an amazing game that a lot of time was obviously invested in and enjoyed yourself does the game suddenly suck because you didnt get the ending you wanted
this game is worth playing and im sure you wont be disappointed by graphics mechanics entertainment or storyso i started mass effect for the first time at the beggining of this month knowing about the controversial ending of me
i beat all three in this months time with very indepth playthroughs and have to say
what was the big deal
the ending was fine
definately one of the top  franchises i have ever played
i gave this game a fun review of  because it really was one of the most fungames ever
however i took away one star from overall because yes this game was rushed a little
if you actually think about it there are only the n missions and priority missions with a couple extra citadel missions that could actually be considered missions
the rest are simply going to all galaxies and finding artifacts and missing people
and as for the ending
the last scene where shepard asks the child about the options for once in the series of mass effect i felt as if the voice acting was extremely lacking
this lack in acting really brought down my mood for the ending
however the idea of the ending was still very good and like bioware insisted it was artistic
there are plenty of other media sources thathave had endings like that
for one the matrix
the ending of reloaded was completely and extremely out of the hat random and unexpected
what do they have in common
all thwarts of interest in the hero mean nothing once you get to the end of the story
the universe is going to change drasticly and no one had a effin clue
another issue people go off is the indoctrination theory
i played the game a lot and not once did i come across that they actually explained it
all i got was machines possess people
end of story
it wasnt game breaking to understand it
if you dont like the game fine but dont say the ending ruined it
people say bioware doesnt love their fans
those who say that arent really fans if they believe that
because all you are doing is being unsupportive to how they decided to end itas many many many others have said the mass effect series was set to be the most amazing scifi entertainment experience of our time
and it is until the ending
over the course of the  games you will fall in love with the characters the story and the scifi universe that so much time and talent were clearly poured into
its an emotional roller coaster where the stakes are unfathomably high
the decisions you must make get more and more difficult the repercussions more and more risky and your actions more and more desperate
everything is riding on you and you will be sucked in before you know itthen the developers decided to kill everything
they throw the entire franchise away
the ending is completely out of left field full of contradictions involves a glowing space baby ignores  worse completely invalidates  all your decisions and most heart breaking of all it ruins the beautiful scifi universe bioware created foreveri want to talk a little about the last bit there
imagine if return of the jedi ended with luke having to activate a mysterious device on the death star that would cripple the empire and everyone else by sending a force wave through the galaxy that would blow up every hyperdrive and droid in existence
imagine if the last episode of star trek the next generation had picard stopping the romulans by activating an alien artifact that causes a warp cascade event making every dilithium crystal in the galaxy stop working forever blowing up every star ship and as a side effect every vulcan and klingon would evaporate for some reasonthats what i mean when i say it ruins the scifi universe
star wars without hyperspace travel wouldnt be star wars it would just be wars
star trek without warp drive would just be nothing because nobody would be treking anywhere between stars or otherwise
mass effect well isnt mass effect after the endingif george lucas had been brought in to think of the ending to the matrix on the last day of shooting having never read the script or even heard of the premise behind the film it would have been a better ending than this
if the movie alien ended with a talking alien telling ripley that it finally understood the human emotion of love it would have been a better ending than this
if back to the future ended with marty meeting a space baby who tells him he has to murder baby doc brown in the past to make the timeline right it would have been a better ending than this
only this isnt the ending to a  hour movie
its the ending to three  hour games where you own every decision the main character makes
it is a groundbreaking new kind of epic disappointment never before experienced in the entertainment industryheres how it should have ended victory cheering a medal credits
nothing fancy
nothing franchisekilling
just what we were expectingi played through the trilogy on single player and am just starting to play through multiplayer with my friends and we still enjoy iti really enjoyed me even with its few faults
me is lesser in every way
why didnt the major website reviewers pickup on thissure me has lots and lots of actor dialog but the new characters are surprisingly uninteresting except for edi who gets the best lines throughout the game
theres plenty of unique planets to visit but the stories told on each planet arent that interesting
and the games overall story can be done pretty quickly
and then theres that ending which most folks didnt like i agree with them
too many of the combat abilities are just like mes when fighting i might as well have been playing mehonestly this game is going right back into the resale pile i couldnt care less what the dlc will be   free or not freedefinitely an unfortunate conclusion to the trilogy
lets hope bioware learned its lessons after disappointing so many with dragon age  and then mei love the mass effect series mass effect  an  were overall two the best games ever
mass effect   though good with less development time than the previous games you can tell it was rushed
some things that after playing that told me the game was rushedscripted dialogue where in the previous mass effect games you talked to someone and the dialog wheel would come up so you could have a conversation most of the ones in me were pre scripted you couldnt choose a responselack of exploration you had the normandy and citadel to explore and that was about itmost of the choices from the previous games were given little more than lip service or really didnt live up to the promises bioware madethe rachni were a good example if you killed the queen in me they were still there in me if you let the queen live and by conversation in me thought they would be a big part in helping you in me they did nothing it was pretty disappointinggetting war assests was nothing more than going to a system and scanning and seeing a little thing pop up you gained themand never seen them in action at the endgetting missions to get the aformentioned war assests were mainly you eavesdropping on a conversation some random npc was having which was pretty lameif you kept your ashley or liara romance bioware promised something big they might have had something planned but it was pretty much the same as the last two games nothing specialthe ending i believe the stories that the two lead writers came up with it at the last minute with no input from anyone else on the writing team you can tellsome other disappointing things in the game were the crew choices you had none of the new crew from me even after doing all those loyalty missions and if your romanced someone in me it came to nothing in me since they couldnt join you on the normandywhy did most of the game have you fighting cerberus
i thought the reapers were the main threat they really should have broke it up to mass effect  and  have you fight cerberus in me and unite the galaxy for the incoming reaper threat with an indoctrinated illusive man unwitting helping the reapers by fighting shepards attempts
and a mass effect  that had the reapers big attackthere were some great aspects of the game though the genophage and quarian parts were well written and great and other aspects of the game with the crew were also funin summary mass effect  is a good game just not what it could have been and is the weakest part of the series it was like return of the jedi or the dark knight rises both were not as great as empire or the dark knight and me was a step down from meokay mass effect  is not a one star game but neither is it a five star game
i agree the ending was indeed horrible but there are parts of the game that are compelling
overall the controversy that surrounds mass effect  is the ending and how it makes no sense
i agree it makes no sense
having a godchild come out of nowhere and tell you we destroy you to save you yeah that doesnt make sense now does it
i understand that there has been a lot of arguing about gamer entitlement and how mass effect fans had their hopes up about how their choices would matter in the final battle
well they didnt get that and now their pissed
can you blame them because i dont
and for the record there is no entitlement
what mass effect fans had was trust and a lot of it
we trusted bioware to give us a game that would wrap up the entire franchise they way our choices culminated
that didnt happen instead we got three color coated endings with a deus ex reference and an adam and eve allusion
however bioware stated many times that there would sixteen different endings and that your decisions would matter over the course of these games
but that was a lie and lying costs costumer loyalty for future titles
even the bbb better business bureau said that bioware did indeed falsely advertise mass effect  so does this make mass effect fans whiny entitled brats that they didnt get what they want
no mass effect fans have every right to voice their outcry against bioware for lying to them and calling the ending their artistic vision
if the ending was just some simple happilyeverafter ending im sure the mass effect series would still be remembered for years to comethis is how the endings should have played outhappilyeveraftershepard with loveinterestbittersweetshepard sacrifices himselfherselfbad endingreapers continue their harvest of galactic civilizationswith that terrible ending though
mass effect  is still a great game with an okay mp
however i did not buy mass effect  for the gameplay or the mp
i bought mass effect  for its compelling narrative
now with an ending that sabotages the core of the games story and biowares unbiased attitude towards fixing it
i just dont know if ill be there for them when dragon age  come out
lets just hope the extended cut is the indoctrination theory because if not then bioware will possible face a boycottok guys im writing my review after playing  hrs or so of mass effect   im going to update this review as i go along if i find anything that strays me from this initial reviewok a quick background i play a lot of games for fun but by no means am i a super hardcore
i consider myself the average consumer who likes to play new video games
ive only played me loved it it was a lot of fun
i loved the epicness of that gameso onto megameplay  in the beginning i feel like it doesnt quite have that epicness punch that me had
i think since the game is just starting off its a good thing to put a lot of punch into the beginning to really excite the player
some of the initial gun battles mixed with a ton of cut scenes are kinda dull
it gradually picks up so it isnt that big of a deal
after the initial intro you get back into that me gameplay style you know what im talking about the free roam flying around the galaxy choosing which quest to tackle next
thats the gravy of this game and im glad that it goes back to that style
a couple things ive noticedthere are a ton of chicks in the game haha it seems like everywhere i go its me a bunch of chicks and the mexican guy thought it was kinda funny
also ive noticed that this game is extremely blue heavy
for anyone that has the game just look at all the colors blue is everywhere blue lights blue tints blue eyes blue clothes everything is blue
i think the developers really like blue again not an issue just an observation
one thing i dont like that bothers me is the running mechanics
i hate that you have to hold down a to run
in doing so you have to take your thumb off of the aiming thumb stick which makes it hard to run to a really specific location
i wish they could make the running button like any other game where you click down on a thumbstickgraphics  its no surprise that this game looks ridiculously good
im on a  inch led tv everything hooked up with hdmi etc yada yada and it looks amazing
the scenes are awesome some serious eye candy
there are a couple scenes that i think me did better and looked better but its minimalaudio  a quick background on my system
im rocking a  dolby digital surround sound onkyo txsr receiver polk audio tsis for the fronts polk audio tsi cs center energy take classic surrounds energy  inch sub in the rear and a klipsch  inch sub in the frontso i got the audio category coveredand let me tell you there are some scenes that literally almost brought my apartment down specifically the dream sequence with the kid if or when you play the game youll know what im talking about
the surround sound is also really good and puts you right in the action
the one thing i wish they wouldve done and it might be because im spoiled on battlefield s sounds but the guns to me sound really lame
i mean im shooting an assault rifle and it sounds almost like a pellet gun
i wish they would put some beefy loud gun sounds
i want to really rock my system like i do with battlefield   explosions and the destruction sounds really good voice dialogue is crystal clear music is amazing so everything is thereexcept for the gun sounds
but again its not a big enough deal to warrant a star dropconclusion so far me is a welcome addition to the series
everything is hitting all the right notes for me
i think since me was my first me experience it still has that magic but me is bringing back those amazingly fun memories
i think the more i play it the more ill enjoy it
for anyone on the fence about this game  if you havent played me or me i would suggest playing those for the full experience yeah i know i need to play me d  and full understanding of the story  if you have played me before buy this game i mean how can you play the other ones without playing the conclusion to the story
thats it for this review ill update the review as i play more and see anything new that i want to add to it
cheersmass effect  brings the mass effect story to a conclusion and does so successfully
nearly everything in the game works well and adds to the fun
the guns are better the powers have been upgraded and even the armor customization continues to evolve
many beloved characters have returned and shepard gets to enjoy the end of the series with them before reaching the endspeaking of the end it seems many are unhappy with it
at first i was a bit confused and disappointed as well
after a few completions it grew on me however
what really helped me was going back and playing the first  again especially the first
hearing random people talk about the keepers and being able to see all the hints
the citadel tower layout being in the shape of a reaper
reading about the planet klencory and after hearing a writing team member hint at what the catalyst actually was  it all made more sense
this made the ending less of a deus ex machina and brought in chekovs gun
it may seem odd but in a way the catalysts explanation does make sense
perhaps the ending was less about having options and more about choosing what is available and making do with what is in front of you
maybe the beings of light were written into the first game as a somewhat hidden way out a plan for the series conclusion in case other ideas didnt work out
either way it was a fun experience and i look forward to the extended cut future campaign dlc and more multiplayer
i believe time will be kind to this game and opinions will soften as the years passif i had reviewed this game the day after i completed it i probably would have given it one star based on the atrocious ending
in terms of bad video game endings the closest comparison i can make is that of themonkey island  lechucks revengegame which was also an excellent game but featured the infamous the game was just a kids fantasy while at a carnival with his family endinghaving waited a week i can look at mass effect  with a fresh perspective and what we basically have is a star classic dragged down to  stars because of its endingwhile i think the original mass effect was the purest rpg of the series and thus had the best gameplay mass effect  plays as great as one would hope and expect
the only gripes i will mention are three first the slightly watereddown rpg elements perhaps a necessary evil undertaken by bioware to broaden the series appeal from the second game on
second on a related note i feel the rpglite elements were further diluted because having imported my character from the first and second games i was immediately given a huge number of ability points to divvy up among my skills
as a consequence i had maxed out my important skills within the first five hours of play which rendered leveling up less significant than in the other two games
i liked that the game was rewarding me for playing the first two games but it would have been better to have more skills to divide my points
third i had three system freezes in mass effect  the only three freezes i had in the entire trilogy
this to me indicated a lack of polish that the other two games hadback to the ending  without giving away major spoilers picture thestar trek the motion picture  the directors editioncaptain decker ending mixed with religious undertones shepard as a christlike figure and joker and edi as adam  eve add in some major plot inconsistencies involving established concepts like the mass relays the introduction of a new and crucial character completely out of left field and you have the mass effect  ending
besides being a major downer of an ending and besides having plot holes big enough to fly the normandy through the biggest problem with the ending is that you get essentially the same ending no matter what choices you made throughout the three gameswe have seen the bioware apologists out in the media defending the artistic vision for the ending
fair enough but the ending bioware presented should have been one possible ending to the game
if i played as a paragon throughout the trilogy making peace among the various factions throughout the three games etc i should been given astar wars episode vi return of the jedi widescreen editionorstar trek twodisc editiontype of ending
the argument that mass effect  had one and only one ending completely violates the principle built up among the three games that our choicesdecisions had consequencesthere has been a great deal of recent discussion about the socalled indoctrination theory the idea that the ending is simply a ruse an illusion brought upon commander shepard due to his being unknowingly influenced by the reapers
this is i am afraid wishful thinking the fact that bioware is promising dlc this summer providing more cinematicepilogue scenes for the ending but most tellingly promising nothing about additional gameplay as part of the ending disproves the indoctrination theory rather convincinglymost likely the dlc will be some token scenes possibly even static images if ea is too cheap to pay for new cinematics showing what happened to your various crew members
chances are it will satisfy no one and will end up being biowares equivalent of attempting to douse this internet firestorm of criticism with a tiny garden hoseone famous quote that i think applies here a problem is nothing more than an opportunity in disguise
bioware can turn this ending outrage around in a second and win back the praise of its many fans by offering a new ending via dlc
or  if due to pride or a simple inability to own up to a mistake bioware is unwilling to alter the mass effect  ending rectify the situation and make a mass effect  that in the first  minutes of the game undoes the mass effect  ending via the indoctrination theory or in some other fashion and gives us commander shepard back in glorious fashion
even if a mass effect  is not even a complete certainty yet i think many mass effect fans including myself would be excited about even a vague announcement by bioware that a fourth game is being planned starring commander shepard
that would be enough of a tacit admission at least for me by bioware that they bungled the ending for mass effect  and that a fourth game is necessary to rectify the situationto go back to one of my original points it took six years for lucasarts to rectify the monkey island  ending with the excellentthe curse of monkey island
lets hope bioware follows suit
otherwise i cannot envision replaying mass effect  and making different decisions in the story or getting overly excited about new singleplayer dlc when it all leads inexorably to the same conclusion in the storyin summary i would recommend mass effect  to fans of the first two games but severely lower your expectations for the last  minutes of the storyand hope we have not seen the last of commander shepardstop for a second
look at these reviews
hundreds of onestar reviews mostly given for narrative reasons
few are arguing that this game is bad in the traditional sense
no people are upset by the story and specifically the ending
you should also note the difference between a bad story and an upsetting story
there are a million games some of them bonafide classics that have bad stories
mass effect  is not one of them
this story is great
people care about this story this universe these characters
a whole lot
and thats why people are starting charity campaigns to bring attention to this issue going to the ftc in an attempt to get the government to force bioware to create a proper ending and voicing their displeasure all across the internetbioware has created a fiction that has inspired more passion than any video game ever and a whole bunch of tv shows movies and books as well
these one star reviews are not condemnations they are the highest of complimentsbefore we discuss that controversial ending lets discuss some other issues like the barely discussed game play
its not discussed much because theres no controversy here
its great
combat is legitimately fun even more so than the second game
cover works better theres a legit melee attack and the strategy of your threecharacter team is at its peak due to better ai
for the first time in this series shooting has a weight to it
its not killzone  or anything but shooting feels pretty goodthere are set pieces in this game big enough and thrilling enough to impress nathan drake
the quality of writing writing meaning individual levelsscenes and dialog is beyond reproach and the best ive seen from the medium
the momentum of the story throughout the game is perfectly paced
you may not like where it ends up but you cannot argue with the storytelling
phenomenal
the voice acting is great as usual
the graphics are the best in the series and overall the presentation is immaculate
go back and try the first game again for fun and see how much they smoothed out weird animation glitches and how much more texture there is to me in comparison
its shocking
probably the thing about me that upset me the most is the removal of the film grain filter
i got over it somewhat quickly but i missed the gritty aesthetic the film grain addedall right
the ending
lets do this
in a vague and mostly spoiler free fashion
i thought the game as a whole provided tons of closure
almost from the very start of the game characters and conflicts from the very first mass effect are getting closure and resolution
before the final mission even started i felt i had almost all the closure i needed
i had no need for an ending cinematic that gave me more closure and therefore wasnt disappointed when i didnt really get one
i also have no need for return of the kings thirteen endings but perhaps thats just mei will admit i somewhat understand the feeling that the choices you made in previous games dont affect the ending very much
and its true it is a bit disappointing that some of the choices you make throughout this game and the previous two games basically only boil down to a percentage point
i would have liked to see more of a narrative effect from some of those choicesthat does not mean that nothing you did mattered
nothing could be further from the truth
the absolute best thing about the mass effect series is that with a few exceptions nothing is presented as right or wrong
there are tons of huge conflicts many differing points of view and none of it is black and white
and you empathize with just about all of it
the most powerful and stressful moments of these games are when they make you choose sides in these conflicts
through these choices you form beliefs about the galaxy and the ending puts those beliefs to the test
you are basically shaping the future of the galaxy in the manner that reflects what your shepherd believes and all those previous choices you made fully inform the final choice
its been a week since ive beaten the game and im still thinking about the endingmass effect is easily the most important series of games to come out of this generation
it is also the standard for storytelling in video games that i cant imagine being met or surpassed anytime soon
who knows when well see something this ambitious and successful againi liked the first two games and while the last one was fun  it just wasnt as incredible as   the game just seemed to have been thrown together and desperately needed a better beta test
i would recommend renting over purchasinggot to say just an average game at best
maybe i was expecting too much
i liked me loved me but found me kind of lacking
i cant really put my finger on what it was i can only that i found it to be soplayed the game three times with different imported characters games and one round of no import character and found very little if any difference in the game play or its options other than this or that me character being deadi found it really lame that to get the most war resources or whatever its called achievement you have to play the online only multiplayer gamei did like that they kind of brought back the weapon mods so to speak
graphics were good for me very few gliches if anyand why did they make it so that barrier and fortification and sentinel tech shields offer no protection
i mean i get shot and it affects my shield immediately
in me shields gave you some protection but now it seems like the only reason to have shields is to purge them for closeup damageanyway ok game but buy it usedim going to skip all the broad overviews of the gamesuniverse of me as if youre reading this youre more than likely a gamer and very familiar with it anywaysjust want to echo the thousands of others who have posted their opinions of this game and the horrible way it ends the trilogy
the because cranberriesleft at the altar person far above me really hit the nail on the head
now  i admit that there was basically no way that bioware could have bested me
me is the pinnacle of their work and nothing will ever change that
but  me
ohhhh me
what have you donei can overlook a lot of things in a game
i look for the good and try to ignore the bad
i could have easily done this with me  if if
the game had provided an epic ending befitting this epic series
however unfortunately the end sequence of the game suicide in your choice of three flavors it was well described as by another reviewer only serves to provide a gateway through which onceenamored fans of the series like me will unleash an onslaught of attacksthe mass effect series allowed you to build a character through the first two games with whom you had a unique affinity
this character was you  your choices your mistakes your relationships your lovers your morals
from balls to bones  you knew your character and shaped the galaxy the way you wantedthen  mass effect  happened
you enter into the game a dewyeyed schoolgirl expecting ore excellence and meaningful choices to make  and end up getting thrownout with biowares garbage in some back alley full of the emotionally depraved
the whole game  from beginning to end  betrays the gamer
betrays your shepard
you are thrust into a series of missions and plot twists which all all have predetermined outcomes your choices during which making little to no impact
you keep playing  expecting it to get better
it doesnt
then the game ends in a most ridiculous fashionthen  after completing it  you start thinking about all the other bad points
its like ocd  you cant stop
the weapon upgrade and modification system in this game is horrible  with ten different versions of each weapon that you will never be able to afford and modifications that are complicated and seemingly pointless
remember mes scanning
love it or hate it  it had a purpose
occasionally you were rewarded with an exciting sidemission
in me scanning is reduced down to flying around avoiding reapers so irritating  not at all stimulating or atmospheric while trying to scan planets
you scan a planet  and a little window pops up saying that you have added the turian th fleet armada to your war assets
geez
thanks
that was excitingwar assets  one of the biggest copouts of the entire game
its like bioware sat there thinkig hmmmm  how can we strip out this game to make it easier for us to build
integral parts of the story that should have been elaborated on and characters that should have joined your squad are sent as little trading cards to your war chest
thats it
oh  you got mordin solus
the salarian genius who just cured the genophage
yeah well done  heres a little picture of him and  points for your war effort
well done
gaaaahh
there are a million other points i could pick holes in this gamewith  but ihave to go now and take my blood pressure medsi was fortunate enough to never be spoiled about the ending but had heard a lot about how it sucked
new to the series i made the decision to play through all three and make my own opinion
coming to the end of me yeah i was severely confusedthe game itself is amazing
great graphics gameplay and storyfeeling so unsatisfiedconfused with the ending i took to the internet for help
luckily i was able to find a video on youtube that put together a theory generated by fans using evidence from all three games
this made so much sense and when i looked back i should have noticed the clues left behind supporting this informationfor anyone curious i have the link
if you havent played the game view at your own risk it is a major spoiler
this talks about everything every detail including the very endfor the rest of you i hope this helps as much as it did me
link removed
view on youtube user acavyos and look for theorythis game is one of my favorites
best advice i have is getting all the dlc and just loving this game
its the perfect mash up between mass effect  and i think this game receives so much hate for the ending
overall its a decent fun game that is not a solid rpg like dragon age origins or fallout  or new vegas but the mix of action elements blend well
sure the game has its share of issues planet exploration is nil and the game seems less free than previous installments
face it the bioware hub formula is outdated and obsoleteall in all this game is fun and a decent end to the trilogy
definately a good holdover title until fallout now before i begins this i would like to say yes the ending sucks but its not the end of the worldprosimproved combathorde mode multiplayerimproved graphics and cutscenesgreat soundgreat customizationgreat charactersand now the badconsno rpg elements
pretty much like melack of teammates
there are only like  in my play through some of the characters from me and me are in the game but not playable only cameosonline passthe ending
now its ok not the worst ending ever but a disappointing ending to say the leastlack of side missionsthe conclusionmass effect  is a great game
a little bit disappointing but its great the multiplayer is awesome for some and not for other
the ending is kinda bad but not worth making this review a  star like others
i gave this game minus  stars for the cons i listed the lack of playable characters is also a disappointment but ok the rpg elments are gone just like in me which hardcore me fans will be saddened like myself but if you want a end to the series then play this will you be disappointed but it will still end it for you
and above all have funmass effect  it is an ok game im not oh my god its amazing but its a game like its what ever with the multiplayer its ok i guess i dont play it as much but yea ok gamemass effect  is a great game beautiful graphics strong story with great gameplay and voice acting
unfortunately when the game ends you have no clues of your team members except three of them who were in the normandy shepard had no chance of making it alive where he was guys unless he was superman unfortunately he was just a legend and legends have their place in memoriesgreat trilogy bioware and eai enjoyed this game even though it did not get great reviews
the story continued to keep me entertained for hours and i thought it was just as good as the other  previous games
i would of liked to have seen the story continueafter so much time invested over  years and  games the ending to the trilogy is obtuse and quite frankly silly
when you see how the series wraps up its epic storyline you are left wondering if the writers from lost produced the junk we are left with at the endi have a ton of issues with this game
all the rpg leveling of mass effect  is gone
and now the gameplay is horrid
but i still had a lot of fun
flows better and much smoother than other games
the storyline is horrible but flows much better and is more interesting than most gamesthe ending was the issue
and i will not support a game with a terrible ending
even though the gameplay and story up until the ending was funi ordered this game long before the release date and reading the reviews im kind of sorry i did though i havent gotten to the end yet
the postal service lost my first game somewhere in transit and while amazon was awesome about replacing the game they sent me the normal version without the preorder goodies
any idea how to go about fixing thisthanks
