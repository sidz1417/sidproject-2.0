the only thing going for this is the rocking boat and water
thats itthe rest is a madding and muddled mess 
first off im either pc inclined or just to obnoxic for my own good because graphically i wasnt that impressedfor me there is a slight blur to everything and if were using a measuring stick here  we all know that halo  graphically looked superiour if not alot of other games on xbox
in other words we know the xbox can do more 
i will admit that there was a certain wow factor to the physics of the waves and when i climbed that crows peak and held on looking over the open intensely wavy sea i had a moment of admiration for a nicely developed ship being tossed in the middle of the ocean while giant rolling waves created by a electrifying storm surrounded me from every direction thats was but a fleeting moment and the only reason im giving  stars and the only postive yah gonna read here ltthere is just too much wrong with this game
the controls are annoying and completely unnesscary
maybe if the came was a straight d third person shooter or a first person shooter it might have had more premise but come on
who wants to shift between one angle to another which are all quite frankly botched everytime you get into a action sequence
slipping between crap third angle few to crap over the shoulder view sucked though it may have had more credit and control if they just made the descion to stick to the over shoulder angleas it is the controls are adaptable if u persist and u are actually keen to fine out the clearly obvious and drab progression of storylineth simply fact is for it all its shiny ocean whisles and sea bells the game just aint fun
it a cliche of bad survial horror mistakes that fans have been screaming about for yearskeycards tank controls every changing uncontroble camera angles and banel boring collect the message type storylinethough not as inane and bad as capcoms dino crisis  you will find yourself completely lost and experience great frustration as u seek to remember how the hell you get to where you have to go
furthermore the game gets boring and unscary if it really had any impact at all
you would think being lost in the middle of the ocean at night on a ship in a storm invested with mutant flesh sacks coming for your throat would bewellnot exctaley engaging but interesting and scary
nup besides the odd ai jumping at you or a sequenced boo moment there aint no thrill herewhy 
there just isnt any atmosphere seeping through the game to draw the gamer into a more psycological state  which i feel is the best way to go
boo scares should be left with the old resident evil games and horror evolutiuon shows that the more intense cerebral horror experiences is what gets under a gamers skin and makes for a great horror gamesthere is nothing scary about lurching monsters or zombie sea men that groan and have a stupid starfish looking creature spew out of it
especially when you have to shoot heads with sloppy controls and then stomp on it in repative fashion  with every single one of them   over and over againcome onnnnnnnnnnnnnn 
for me this is old style gameplay done badly and really represents an interesting concept flawed by poor gameplay and a lack of any real atmosphere
due to the sheer frustration of the controls and lack of ongoing interest it wont be a game you play again and again if even once all the way throughmay it hit the  buck cheapo bins faster than a rolling wave in a swollen storm my interest was piqued by the concept of this game so i was excited to have time to start playing it
unfortunately it did not deliverwhile the art textures light shaders is excellent the level design is mediocre at best
it was ambitious to have a large chunk of a game like this on a relatively small ship but as it turns out it may have been a bit too ambitious
while the art and environment are excellent and immersive there are many points one reencounters crosses over and at many points objectives are simply names of places you havent been yet so you rather stumble around aimlessly hoping to hit what youre looking for instead of making clear progress or heading through a relatively fixed course
as with many other tpss the camera angle is fixed in most enclosed spaces which makes it absolutely useless for exploring a room moving through the room or spottingfighting enemies
this leads you to spend most of your time in the pseudofps overtheshoulder aiming mode so that you can actually see where youre going
however this slows you down
so your choice is between either having no idea what youre actually looking at is there a bulkhead a door a shelf or a killer zombie just outside this camera angle
 or seeing what youre looking at but progressing at an agonizingly slow pacethe physics is also mediocre to poor
aiming is difficult to nearimpossible for the first half of the game because the ship is rolling and your aim shifts randomly along with the motion of the ship
there are a few scares but if you want to be scared witless try doom  the horror factor of this game pales by comparison to doom  or even the sufferingone of the low points of this game is its aforementioned sloooooow pace
your run is slow walking is even slower and aimwalking is slowest
this is not a fastpaced action shooter like farcry doom  or halflife character balance is pisspoor
you babystep along your aiming is sluggish and extremely difficult to be accurate
this is partly a limitation of xbox controls but when you fire up the game youll see what i mean
theres a clumsiness level built in that might be hmm too realistic to be funsave points are preset
you can encounter some pretty stupid obstacles pretty far along beyond a save point and find yourself repeating  minutes of gameplay sometimes more than once
that alone can be infuriatingas i said the art is excellent very interesting even highly immersive and the concept is fascinating but this is not a huge game
it has a bmovie storyline i read everything along the way and trust me it sucks it is slowpaced the physics suck and the characters balance and range of motion just sucks
overall a letdown
its not worth the time or money for a little eye candy it might be worth a few hours of semifun and cool environments when you can buy a used copy for i got this headset for use with the logitech precision controller
while it does work for some folks i found it completely inadequate for my needs
first of course it wasnt really functional with my wireless controller
i dont understand how they let this go by but i found that when pushing up on the right stick i would get a strange white noise which wasnt extraorinarily loud but it also was sent through to my teammates
it was fun to joke about for a few minutes but not to the tune of the price of this thingthe quality of the audio is also rather poor
it was advertised to go  feet but it is more like  there is a persistant white noise in the background and that popping noise gets on my nervesfinally oye logitech customer support is something else
they told me that all the problems including the fact that it wasnt compatible with the wireless controller the item it is pictured with
does not count as a manufacturers defect
since i had lost the receipt i had to call it a wash it just sits in a box in a closetreviewed for big boss games by kbnping pals wont earn ds owners many friends although the nintendo ds is at its heart a revolutionary step forward in gaming tech the major problem with its feature rest in supportrelease titles for the nds were scanty and though there were a few hardhitters there were just as many that leave gamers scratching their heads and asking why
therein lies the flaw with ping pals an upgrade of sorts for the nintendo dss builtin standard pictochat featurethe major problem with ping pals is that it is technically a game not a software patch
which makes it incompatible with normal pictochat
anyone who owns a ds will attest that its hard enough to find someone in chat mode within  feet without also requiring them to be running the same game
but as youd expect ping pals does support the ds download play system which would allow a friend to download the game and then chat with youhowever that leads us into the second problem
the allure of ping pals comes from the customization of the chat experience
namely avatars music backgrounds and textured paper on which to write
however anyone who downloads the game from you wont be able to see or use any of these features
and as you may or may not have expected these addons dont come free
you must use ingame money to purchase items which can be earned in a variety of ways most of them painful
additionally all the items are very expensive
many times you will see an item which is a lot of money spend hours playing and finally buy it only to find out you hate how it looks
and you cant return it only sell them to other ping pals which can be quite frustratingall in all despite its total uselessness ping pals does have have a few redeeming factors
you do earn a weekly allowance if you log on the first day you booted up the game and its not too shabby
also some items are only available on special days at certain times so if youre a collector you need to log on often
so basically the customizable avatar is the only saving graceping pals for the ds gets a pathetic  starsthis game is pretty much like picto chatbut it has colormusicyou can customize your character and you can put a backgrounddont use your money on thiskeep them until dynasty warriors comes out to sale or need for speedthe game are coolalso gundam is coming outnow this is a game that really isnt worth your money
all this does is make chatting a little bit weirder
now if ur a young person trying to look old or an old person trying to look young u might wanna buy this piece of one of dss little failures
little minigames and buying clothes while chatting is all u can do on this game take my advice and stay away from this gamethe word that best sums up this game is why
it seems to me that a dating sim like this should be free on a pervert websitethe game isnt totally bad its funny with plot twists and memory games
but dont confuse yourself if you buy this game you have committed an act of idiocywow i bought this gamelike an idiot thinking it would be something fun like the sims but just dating instead of always having to eat and pee
well just for your info this game sucks
wow where do i start first of all there are only  hott girls in the game and  are ugly
i mean that is sucks because i do not want to date ugly girls
some levels are extremely hard to win like the one where u have to get panties and a dragon tattoo
what the
a dragon tattoo
oh yea and if u r gonna buy this game  see some panty shots sucks for u because there are none and when we friggen beat the game all that happens is it says congradulations and shows a picture of u kissing the girlthat sucksoh yea u cant even walk around in the game all u do is just talk
yes the music is extremely repetetive although nice at first
no girl in real life is as hard to hook up with as they r in this game
well the only good thing about this game was put me in a skiingsnowboarding moodoh yea u cant do that eitherbecause it is set a ski logde
instead of buying this game save up your money and go skiing
and if u dont have that much just buy the simsthis game got a lot of great reviews so i bought it for my children ranging from  yrs
old and they all said it was a really hard game and could barely get past the first couple of levelsand there are no save points through the level so it makes it extra difficult game has been sitting on the shelf now since the second day we got itwhy would someone ever buy this
i dont think its needed
the nintendo ds comes with a charger already
and it charges the batteries thats already inside i dont know which batteres cuz i never put any batteries inside but it works
you can alwasy just charge the batteries before a car trip
or charge it in a hotel room with the charger you already have
this charger is very not neccessary
unless of course u lose the one that came with the nintendo dsthis game is poorif you a person who expecks a game that says your system meets the requierments on the boxthen when you get it home and play the game with the latest patch it keeps on leaving the game during play saying wings over vietnam has encountered a probelm every missionkicks you back to your desktop i make my attack on antiair craft gunsthier are too many of these in the game with unrealistic ranges like a soldier on a fixed machine gun  miles aways that can shoot at you  and blow up your plane i find myself falling asleep during the game because the missions are too long to reach the targetthen you have these antiaircraft guns that dont blow up after direct hits with everything you gotwhen you take off in rd person the games camera goes crazy back and fourth left and right i knew when this happen i was dealing with a crappy game urbz is billed as an edgy street savvy version of the sims
the characters wear hip clothes and have a different aim in life  to have funas with the standard sims game you get to customize your character although on the ds your choices are limited
a few hair styles four shirts and youre stuck with a miniskirt and boots although the colors can be cycled
you get questions such aswhat is the meaning of life
 having the toughest rep mad lt computer skillz fat sacks of cash money bustin sweet rhymesim sorry but none of these come close for me  other questions provide choices that are equally cute but not necessarily even in the running
in one you win k and your choices to spend it are on a pool on perfume or on fancy bling
ickthe game itself uses the top screen for the actual monitor and the bottom for your choices  watching current tasks tracking inventory and so on
sometimes it works well when you keep your todo list easily visible
other times it is more kludgy as you have to look back and forth between the two screens to make choices and see the resultsthe pacing of the game wasnt set up very well
im a long time sims fan and understand all the basics of feeding washing and entertaining your sim
but you begin in an apartment building with multiple floors and you spend your time racing from floor to floor to get to that toilet or bed before disaster strikes
where other games let you explore and get comfortable with the game for some reason the urbz makes you feel like disaster is about to strike if you dont figure out where the nearest toilet isthere are the usual friendship building which in this case involves first guessing and then remembering what topics a person enjoys talking about
that is a fun twist on the usual random chatter
there are also minigames such as the avoid bird poop that gets the game goingfun for those seeking a missionbased game that has a bit of urban hip appeal but where the sims is relaxing and rewarding for some reason with the urbz on ds it makes it feel like youre barely hanging on by the skin of your teeth
which is maybe the edgy attitude they wanted but i play games to escape from the stress of real life ill be the first to admit the marketing got me
i thought this game was a sims equivelent and unfortunatly i was wrong
this game as innovative as it is is just not fun
you are a character who has gotten kicked out of the building that you were working for and are forced to make a living on the streets
you work your way to the top so you can stop this evil scheme
wow that sounds like fun
this game just wasnt for me
like any simstype game you have those stats bathroom hygeine sleep and they go down far to quickly you just dont have time to enjoy anything
im sorry but this wasnt a good game
i would definitly not reccomend iti have been playing mario  ds for a few weeks now
i have played it long enough to now write about the controls with the knowledge that they will not get any more comfortable with extended playwith that said i can say with confidence that the engineers who designed this handheld have doomed it to an early demise due to unbelievably leaving out analog control
it is amazing that they would take the time to create a system capable of displaying beautiful and fluid d graphics mario  is amazing looking but then utilize a control scheme last used on the snes which specialized in d scrollers
just think of rd person d games you play on your home consoledo you ever use the control pad to control the character or the analog stick
i will bet you use the analog stick and could not even imagine using the digital pad
the nintendo ds asks no make that demands that we forget all the advances in d gaming and go back to the bad old days of digital control
the virtual analog control offered by the touch screen is completely ineffective and amazing frustrating
this system badly needed an analog control stick like the psp has even more that it needed a gimmicky touch screen
basically the ds will be relegated to mini game type products and an occasional first person shooter which stylus control could be ok but any hopes of d adventure games is totally ruinedin closing i compare mario ds to an amazing looking thanksgiving turkey that is made of plastic
it wonderful to look at but you cannot actually enjoy eating itshame on nintendo for overlooking analog control
the saddest thing is that they will probably have to scrap the ds and come out with another handheld that has an analog stick
effectively screwing all of us who bought this flawed producti never should have played the original or this updated version of the most overrated mario title nintendo ever released
the praise this game still receives in this day and age not necessarily for its gameplay but mainly for its influence mind you is staggering and sickening
super mario  never impressed me at all in the n days nearly  years ago when i was supposed to swallow the enormous popularity but intelligently never did and it certainly doesnt impress me now
nintendo had a perfect opportunity to finally make this overrated lackluster game into something truly special from a gameplay perspective but they failed to do so
they could have finally corrected a wrong thats been annoying me for the better part of two decadesyou can play as not only mario but also luigi yoshi and wario each with their own unique abilities
you have to search for and pick up their caps scattered throughout the levels often times worn by the enemies meaning you have to take out the enemies to obtain them
these are nice additions admittedly and i honestly dont even need to tell you what these abilities are you already know since they havent changed in years
luigi jumps high
no way
warios powerful
get out of town
yoshi spits eggs
i doubt that
yeah you get the idea
theres a few other things this game adds thats totally unnecessary such as giganticsized mario that can smash anything in sight for a few seconds an overused cheap gimmick that would soon explode in eye candy redundancy when the new super mario bros games would release and those irritating rabbit chasing games which appeared quite often in the galaxy series
the one mistake the galaxy series made was including so many rabbing chasing obstacles and super mario  for the ds gives us more of those than we can honestly handle
chasing rabbits is stupid
the worst part is that theres an extended rabbit grabbing mission both inside and outside the castle when you get close to the end of the game that takes up a good  minutes of playtime and its absolutely terrible
the bloated floating mario powerup is kind of cool thoughthe most unusual and annoying aspect of this game that totally perplexes me is that the levels still feel needlessly overlarge
nintendo had a ripe opportunity here to fill in all these dreadfully empty and boring areas with tons of goodies to make them feel complete
i mean why not fill in the empty areas
instead nintendo left these stages the way they are more or less
they wanted to preserve the game the way most people like it which was of course a bad idea
of course the even bigger insult is that nintendo added a few new levels that feel incomplete and outdated just like the regular levels
why nintendo why
why match basic unfocused blockyshaped level design with more basic unfocused blockyshaped level design
instead of fixing the outdatedness of the presentation of the game nintendo just throws in a few more simplistically created areas and calls it a day
talk about a slap in the face for those of us expecting something more appealing visuallyanother really big problem is that in order to grab all  stars we have to go through the same levels again and again
talk about repetition at its absolute worse and going through the same areas over and over will only end up making me want to replay this game even less
and by less i of course mean never again
knowing that the game is still intentionally made to force gamers go through the same areas yet again just to obtain another golden star is really pathetic
create mario games either the super mario bros  way where you only have to go through a stage one time before moving on or the yoshis island way where if you successfully collect everything your first time and  a level you wont have to return to the same stages anymore
dont make us go through areas we already completed time and time again for one simple little golden star where the adventure getting to it is hardly ever rewarding challenging or lengthy enough to make an impression anywaythe controls are horrible once again this time persevering a dpad instead of a big clunky n controller both ideas fail to work right
the music is absolutely terrible beyond comprehension
having to constantly rearrange camera angles is incredibly outdated and annoying
super mario galaxy proved that switching camera angles is no longer necessary
its way too happy which is no doubt deliberate on the part of nintendo for the entire purpose of rubbing more salt in the wound
seriously nintendo its possible to make happy music without the irritating obnoxiousness that only ends up distracting whats clearly already a really lame and outdated game overall
no need to make the experience even worse with music that makes you want to tear the skin off your body
an example of quality happy music is the stuff we hear throughout world  of super mario bros   remember the joyful and innocent music in that game
the music was tame and never frantically irritating
in super mario  ds however the musics like a hayride from the county fair to the downtown post office that rides on an endless loop in the most annoying way imaginable
super mario bros  is just one of several examples i could name that shows the way music should be for a platformer that often times requires concentration to succeed
at least the remixed soothing water music now with technoish beats is decent
if any other themes have been remixed i cant telland we have  more stars to collect bringing the total to  this time around which means an extra hour or so to collect everything the game has to offer
i would mention several other features that drag down this supposed classic but i already touched upon those subjects in my review for the nintendo  version of super mario  so theres no need to repeat myself here
the cuteness factor of certain areas is enough to make me puke though
i dont mind the occasional childish graphics and objectives but super mario  takes the childish aspects to really pathetic depths that feels more intended for babies instead of kids
take the penguin race level with the penguins and snowmen for example
throws up  not something grown men who grew up during the s when mario was fresh challenging fastpaced and arcadelike would ever admit to enjoying without blushing
and what does mario say at the beginning of each level
lets tickle
miss pickle
popsicle
theres like a million things he could be saying there
i was informed hes saying lets ago but i absolutely cant make out those words at all
i had this same trouble with the n version since its the same exact line lazily copied into this gamejust skip super mario  ds
i absolutely loathe this game
the only reason i gave it another chance is because i thought nintendo radically changed the game and morphed it into something entirely different by ditching all the old outdated and tiresome ideas that never worked in the first place and yet only existed in the late s because nintendo was riding the d wave and needed something cutting edge on the market
its no longer  though
my how i was wrong on all counts to give this game a second chance on the ds
the two worst levels have remained which only adds to my anger
the level where you have to tediously and accurately jump across a series of rotating poles above the water collecting coins and the rainbowcolored carpet ride which is essentially an autoscrolling level when you think about itat least the ghost house is pretty cool
a piano snapping and chasing me around the room is pretty fun as is punching enemies and knocking them out for coins
but uh coins
that brings me to another subject and another annoyance
absolutely the biggest thing nintendo should have clearly changed is the collect  coins for a star levels
this means for several minutes im forced to thoroughly explore mediocre levels just to obtain enough coins for a star
a sickening dreadful terribly unsatisfying concept if there ever was one
youd have to be the most delusional person on the planet to enjoy collecting  coins while absorbing these unspectacular levels
im done with this review
between gamers believing this game is actually a classic and the little enjoyment i get out of it despite relentlessly giving it more chances i just cant handle it anymorethis game is crap i had to get rid of this the controls are sluggish dont buy the ds version if u have an n get the original or download it if u have a wii just avoid this at all costthe game controls are hard to work boring  easy to beat tooomg this game is so much worse than i remember or the  version was horrible and i dont remember righti thought for sure the game would get better but  stats in youd wished youd never bought it
the main character moves at a snails pace and controlling jumping is so tough it wont be worth it
the new unlocks are lame ad chasing rabbits with a slow character isnt much funid say burn this version or the old version too and just keep the memories because this isnt what u remember from being a kidi just became a proud owner of an xbox  i had always wanted to take a stab at the mech assault games on the xbox and thankfully mech assault was finally listed as being backwards compatible with the xbox ive been a fan of the mechwarrior universe ever since mechwarrior  made its debut on the pc
yeah that was a long time ago
i was itching to play the same kind of in depth game again
i couldnt wait to open up the package and play a modern mechwarrior game again
afterall the reveiws had been great
plus it had been a while since a good mechwarrior game had come out
mechwarrior  was awful and the fourth wasnt that much better either
well neither is this game
in fact its worse than mechwarrior  or  at least in those games you actually can group weapons together be inside the cockpit and have decent story linesmech assault  lone wolf fails in ever category to satisfy the hardcore mechwarrior gamer
theres no mechs to buy no upgrades no grouping of weapons no commanding of fellow mechs no fun period
if youve played and enjoyed the mechwarrior  series you know what kind of greatness is within those games
this game reminded me of a bad beta demo of armored core
the ai is horrific as well
i cant tell you how easy it was to outthink any enemy i came against not theres much to it in the first place
thats because the aiming and targeting is flawed as well
i remember the old days of hitting someone in the legs and knocking their legs out
well if youre lucky youll do that in this game but nine times out of ten youll just waste your unlimited ammo as wellthe other thing that really brought this game to a new low was the ability to walk through these icons in the map to increase your weapon strength and your health and your power
in the old games the entire mission was made realistic by giving you a mech and your wits
if it got busted all up to heck you had to fix it after the mission
not this game just plop over a health powerup and your health goes right back up
yeah thats great if youre a two year old playing this game and you have no recollection what a real mech game played like
unfortunately for me i do rememberheres the other thing
what ever happened to overheating
if you fired too much in the old days your mech would die
not here in this game either
just fire away until your thumbs get tired and nothing will stop youthis game is very simplistic and very unoriginal
it was painful for me just to get through a few missions before i finally tossed it aside and trade it ingameplay the controls were actually easy to use
no problem getting around and shooting
there is just not good enough aiming qualitygraphics ive seen better on the xbox like halo s graphics engine however ive also seen way worse graphics as well
just average visuals here
frankly i think im being generous with this ratingpresentation the reason this gets such a low score is due to the games history as a whole
i know the kind of potential mechwarrior games have and this game does not even compete
it tries to lure you in by saying you can jump in and out of mechs
however this is the only thing trying to lure you into the game
its a great feature but when the game is designed around this premise thats when it failsfeatures this game is so unoriginal and so not full of anything it leaves you so bored by the second and third missions you wonder why you continue to play
the features are simple move fire one single weapon oh and by the way you only get a few weapons to select from and jump out of your mech and into another one on the map
remember customizing mechs and stuff before each mission all you mechwarrior  fans
yeah  i guess that must have slipped the game development guys minds because you cant customize anythingoverall if youve never even seen mechwarrior  then this game probably is fun for you
however if you played these games since conception  well  spend your money elsewhere
severe disappointmentmore of an attempt to create a leisure suit larry xtreme party games title rather then a continuance of the classic adventure series leisure suit larry magna cum laude will disappoint a majority of its long time fans
it was a wise move not to make the game about larry laffer but his nephew born from market research larry lovage
instead of talking to women working out puzzles and trying to persuade them to spend some quality time with you here you have a number of arcade games to complete to pass the game
its the most laziest game design id ever seen my heart sank when a majority of the puzzles required you to play pong or take photos
the comedy in the game is okay but it does wear out its welcome when most of the jokes rely on swearing and the fact theyve all been done before to better effect in previous titles
leisure suit larry magna cum laude also has little replay value compared to its predecessors
a game like larry  love for sail had heaps of secrets programmed into it that kept the gamers busy for months playing with shortcut keys and program files
in mcl all you have to do after you finish is keep playing annoying arcade games until you can afford to make everyone nudetheres almost nothing here for the long time fans except slight nudity and a few cheap references to the previous titles
although it should be noted sierra tried to win the old time fans over by saying the series creator al lowe would participate in the creation of this title as a creative consultant
however months went by with lowe not receiving any word from the developers
people had grown impatient and evidently gave up hope on sierra making an effort to contact larrys creator
however just before the release of the game lowe recieved an email from the developers
it turned out the only involvement they intended for al lowe was to make him sign a waver that wouldnt allow him to criticise the game when it came out
lowe humbly refused their offerthe bottom line is any leisure suit larry title where larry dosent even wear a leisure suit is just going be trying too hard to be hipif youre just after a little computer nudity cant you find cheap hentai insteadps
the difference between the uncut version and the censored version is that the censored signs have been removed and theres slightly more graphic version of the barbarajo endingone of the first games i played on my pc was leisure suit larry i and then ii and iii
these were played with the keyboard and you had to type in commandsthis latest incarnation has very little in common with the originals
whereas the originals had some clever humour and puzzles the new one is more of a mashing the buttons  get your timing down type of game
you will be chasing gold coins down for the most partthere just isnt enough to this game
the puzzles are very repetitive and the control leaves a lot to be desired
stay away from this one unless you have a need to own every lsl titleto be honest i was expecting some rare dbz coolness when i bought this for my little brother to play
together we took turns playing and before we knew it the game was overyes you get to almost freely travel
yes the graphics are fairly plausablebut for what reason did they produce this game when they didnt make it exceptional
sometimes i think that the dbz franchise is all about currancy and for nothing elsethis game was alright but just buy tenkaichi insteadokay ill admit i was excited about this game
i went out and bought it the day it was released
but it was really disappointingpositivesthe sound
the music and voices were goodthe combat
i like the combat system
one button is for kicking one for punching and one for ki blasts
by pushing a bunch of different buttons in order you make combos
i also like that you can purchase new moves and techniques with z coins found throughout levelsthe destroyable environment
i like that i can kick my enemy into a rock and it explodes
i like how blasting a car makes it blow upthe coop mode
you and a friend can play together through the missionsnegativethe lack of gameplay
if you just sat down and played this game you could easily beat it in under  hoursthe lack of variety
there are about  different mission types and after awhil everything just seems the same and you find yourself wondering didnt i do this already
not being able to go everywhere in a level
what i mean by that is you basically have a guided path to follow on each level
there are invisible walls keeping you from straying off course
i like to explore so i dont like being limited to one areanot having any vs battle mode
when i saw this was  player i was thinking more of battles not coop
then i noticed it had coop and i was like ok cool
but then i noticed there was no battles
what if you just want to battle your friend in a level you unlocked with a character you unlocked
that wouldve given the game more varietyvery little replay value
once youve played it through you feel almost like itd be a chore to go through it all again
its one youd put aside until you dust it off years later and play it out of curiositythe verdictdiehard dbz fans this is a must have
this is the only dbz game out there right now that lets you wander around worlds
im sure youd enjoy itcasual dbz fans rent it
i guarantee youll beat it before you have to return it
if you like it after that and you have the extra cash find it somwhere cheap and pick it upchildren under  put it on a birthdayholiday list
this is a good one for kids who cant do the puzzle solving of other games or really advanced attacks
this game is really straightforward and easy for kids to understandeveryone else stay far awaythe play link is incredibly easy to use but it doesnt have much bandwidth
downloads literally take  times as long as a true wired connection
im not exagerating its extraordinarily slow
playing on xbox live works great and thats what i used it for most of the time
navigating the internet andor downloading anything on any device plugged into it including the  is very very slowyou can use it to connect anything with a network port to anything else with a network port
it gets better signal than any wireless card ive ever used
i used it for a number of different computers and  xbox si enjoyed the ease of use unfortunately i was only able to enjoy it for about  months
i purchased it in january  and it broke about a month ago
its not very reliable
that and the horrible download speed make me give it a low review
another strange tidbit
i bought it for less than  shipped a year ago
whats up with these pricesthe graphics are very nice but the gameplay is not worthy of anything more than one starthis game is obviously just a beta test version
there is no useful tutorial to learn how to play this game so dont bother purchasing this game
if you bother to spend more than a few minutes playing this game you will quickly realize that the designers of this game did not bother to teach you how to play it
there is no tutorial at all
the windows that pop up have no explanation
this game is a perfect example of bad design
it may be fun for the people who designed it  they know how to play it
but if you install this game and run it you will get no instructions about how to play itbottom line  decent graphics but no instructions  and not even a welcoming introduction to how the gameplay works
stick with cc and dont waste your money on this gamei can see this sinking to budget price soon so if you must play it just wait
i will say i loved liquid entertainments battle realms it was one of the most underrated rts games that had a great feel to it with some refreshing gameplay renewable resources being the big onethis game on the other hand lacks many things that would make it a great rts and even more too given its rpg hybrid tag
unit control and pathing are pretty poor
the online community is just not there and since it is run through gamespy stability is in question
strange things that were in the demo like running in lcd standard res are not in the retailthe game setting of eberron is fairly weak
if i was  i might find it fantastical but now i find it derrivative
that being said this game is dd in name only
no system in the game is remotely taken in to the game you cannot even level your heroes in the campaign mode except with items
granted the creatures and set dressing are dd flavoredthe campaign single player mode is also very silly
it goes from slightly challenging and fun to just impossible as the computer ai has more units than you could possibly ever get and roams around collecting all the resourcesunderneath all this mess is mostly an appealing rts
it does not do anything particularly inventive but is not all that horrible
one major complaint is the micromanagment of collecting shards
you have to keep assigning units to do it
be nice if you could set one unit to just autocollect in an areai hope a patch comes along to stablizes the multiplayer and perhaps improve the single player game but i am sure they are long down the road if at all
liquids battle realms took  patches before the online play was tolerable and they were about several months apartso perhaps with a strong patch this is worth getting otherwise wait for the bargin rack when you have nothing else to dojust got this game installed it downloaded the patch and began play
here is my quick reviewpros
its fun when it works
graphics are kind of cool
using above ground for rts and underground for rpg is a unique ideacons
three factions and two very short campaigns which use only two factions
the third is usable only in skirmish or multiplayer even after the update there are too many crashes
lots of threads about it in the forums on the company website
not enough character races creatures upgrades etc
the way the population limit works kind of sucks
you get premade champions and you dont get to create your own so much for the rpg aspect of the game gold through dungeoneering and taxation is interesting but you have to waitand waitand wait for gold from taxes once youve gotten all the gold from the dungeonsif you really want this game dont spend more than  on this gamethis game takes some of the things we hate from most rts games all of the things we hate from dnd hack and slash games and piles them up into one product
then if that wasnt enough they throw in some of the most obnoxious micromanagement ever concieved can you imagine having to control all of your resource farmers every second of a game
imagine no more you have to in this gamethis one is best totally avoided it is a poor production overall does nothing new and innovative and rips off a ton of ideas from other games  usually bad ideasif you liked warcraft iii you may like this game
the game has a good engine good sounds good cinematic and characters are detailed but that is allif the makers would had put some cool effects when using a spell or an ability the game would be better
buildings and fortress are a joke
gameplay is all about units quantities didnt see much strategy in this game
the ending of the campaign was very disappointingthis game could have been great but it isntin conclusion i would recommend to try a demo before buying this game
i didnt like it so i wont recommend it
try something like battle for middle earth insteadsend me a bootleg copy that works but i cant movie for my pokemoni got this for cheap but based from online recommedations and i dont particularly like it
steep learning curve and dated graphicsgame play
kind of a neat idea that may be cleaned up in the newer edition but after trying this im not that interestedwhat a great deal this was
its always fun to race motorcycles trucks and all kinds of vehicles
most kids like this sort of game although i believe there are many better ones availablei got it because it was cheap it was alright
i would recommend a different gameits one on the  i would recommendi tried to have an open mind
i own raw raw  and now this
i read bad reviews but i kept my mind open till now
the reviews were right
but lets see the good first  ummm gee graphics are good uh thats about it
now the bad and understand people i loved raw   first gameplay what gameplay
it takes taker  minutes to get up and  to deliver a punch
the responsiveness is just not there
oh and dont get knocked down you will never get up
i was put into  straight holds while laying down
oh the ever great counter system that isnt there
what a load of bs that is
commentary the little i hear is terrible
match types hey it has less than raw  tell you anything
my favorite create a wrestler
might as well not be there
you cant even manipulate the body size
he is tall or short fat or skinny thats it
 years removed from n and no mercy and this is all we get
entrance creation i still cant get to work
i made my entrance but its never there
oh likewise for my caw finishers he can never do them
story is straight forward and boring
you can beat the computer my just punching him life bars go down so fast
and yes the game freezes
all this technology and it freezes
but i can get a patch off the net
come on
put the game out without the problem i am the customer not the technician
thq is going down the drain just like its wwe counterpart
lets face it people wwe was better when wcw was still around
wrestling is getting worse and the game market is following
save your money and pray for a smackdown on pspi just bought this game eariler today
when i first started playing it i noticed that it kept freezing up all the time when it was loading
i was plaining to take it back and get a replacement but after reading the other reviews of the same problem ill forget it
this game was a big disapointment to me and im sure to all the other fans who went out and bought it
i hope and pray that they dont make another wrestling game for the xbox
it seems everytime they do it sucks
dont waist your money if youve not bought it yet
buy it used im sure there will be alot of people selling or trading theresi expected more from this being an xbox title but such was not the case
it isnt horrible but it isnt a wrestling game i could recommend unless youre a collector like me
the developer didnt put much heart into this game as it lacks many features and provides a very lackluster create a wrestler optionwhile the graphics are amazing on the entrances everything else seems to be over the top
like raw and raw  the look of the wrestlers and the entrances are the only things that seem to be concentrated on nothing else
the wrestling is crazy and boring and the commentary and music is almost all copied and pasted from smackdown vs raw
studio gigante the new developers are not impressive on their first outing but who knows maybe they will improve over timeno complaintis with amazon they rock
great customer service wish the game companys would be more specificlike saying this is an online multiplayer etc etc
otherwise would not have bought it
maybe amazon could be more specific if possible in the details about the game thinigs like saying  first person shooteronline play only etc etc
well got some other great games from them and am happy as hell
the one thing that i hope never changes is that a live person from amazon is always there to help you 
and they did a few times for me
great job well this review is from playing the demo multiplayer level not the full game
but even in this short of a span i already know this isnt a game im going to put my money down on
i played bf  and loved it
this game looks very vehicle dependent
being on foot is pretty worthless
even if you are an antitank player it really does no good as the antitank missles dont home in and are almost impossible to get a kill on a vehicle at almost any distance
there are aircraft all ove the place as well as antiaircraft missle turrets you can jump into
the only problem is they are suppose be be heat seaking missles but almost never hit their target
the aircraft can drop flares to throw off the homing ability but even when they never drop flares i was only once able to get a kill
so for the most part aircraft can fly around unapposedyoull find yourself getting killed from no where a lot
ill be running along and all of a sudden im dead
i dont know where it came from or what it was
it gives you an indicator to show what direction it is coming from but you almost never see what is shooting at youif you love spawn killing then this game is for you
i would spawn into a base and have a tank  feet from me pointed right at me
you dont even have a chance to move before you are dead
and for those of you that played bf  and remember how bad spawn killing could be its  times worse nowthe sniper is hard to use
i would shoot and shoot and shoot sometimes at a motionless target yet they wouldnt die
maybe this game doesnt let you shoot as far as you can see i dont know
part of the problem is the scope itself
with one of the sniper rifles the crosshairs block what you are trying to aim at
you cant really try to go for a head shot because you cant tell if you are on the head because the crosshairs are always in the way
with the other sniper i used it used a crosshair system i wasnt use to and i could never tell if i was even getting closeto me this game was exactly like the bf  mod modern combat
the vehicles are the same weapons are pretty much the same and even has some of the same problems that modern combat had like the difficulty using sniper scopes and the dependency on vehicles
if you like the modern combat mod then this game may be for you
but i never could get into it and i cant get into this game eitherbattlefield  is a potentially great game
it has a lot of things going for it
the combat the combat kits the helicopters jets and tanks very cool stuff
the problem is in its full execution this game sucks
the maps are big
this means you spend all your time just driving in a tank
you cant walk anywhere because the map is too big
this problem is so fundamental that the makers of battlefield  must be idiots they screwed up bf and vietnam too so i guess so
nonetheless they got more right in bf than in the previous games no question there particularly in the controls
the controls are great here
the problem is they need to team up with the call of duty creators for this game to be worth playingcall of duty  and united offensive got one thing overwhelmingly right  close combat
in fact the creators themselves realized how right they got combat and how much they screwed up the big map bunch of tanks idea and swung too far to the other side with call of duty  which has tiny maps and no vehicles at all
the answer to the ultimate game problem is obvious  we need a game with awesome close combat and maps just big enough and with just enough tanks and jets
bf is far too geared to tanks and planes
there needs to be more emphasis on foot soldiers
too much time getting around too much empty space not enough action  not funthe other thing they screwed up is the pc voice commands
while saying things like enemy chopper spotted or need ammo here
well the commands sound awesome
the problem is you cant tell who is saying them
youre supposed to look at the minimap and see which dot is blinking yellow apparently they need to make it easier
call of duty does a better job at thata tip for you  if youre using zone alarm and having connection problems with this game turn zone alarm off and turn windows firewall on
this solved all my connection problems like many other people are havingi loved bf but this version is so buggy poorly designed and problematic that i have uninstalled it
i will be selling it to a stranger because i wouldnt give this to a friendthe install crashed my computer three times and i had to pull the plug to restart
the load times are about  minutes long
i usually go to the fridge and make a phone call while waiting to join a game
the server list is slow and has no way of filtering all the slow servers like bf
the filter boxes are there but they dont work
 of the servers shown have a ping above all the way up to 
i usually see about three servers with a ping under  other games do not have this problemgameplay artillery and aircraft dominate the game
the commander has a satellite view that shows enemy positions so dont even think of using stealth youll just get arty dumped on you it recharges every two minutes
 of your deaths will be from the air with no warning
this is not that surprising considering the game is based on spawn campingthe vehicles are so slow it feels like slomo
which doesnt really matter since the ground physics make it feel like mud or ice 
vehicles slide all over the place and if the ground is sloped they just keep slidingthi is obviously a beta version released early because they wanted the money
it has already had two patches and a third is being madepurchasers of this game are spearheading a movement to get the game renamed to battlefield ctd
battlefield ctd or battlefield crash to desktop for those who enjoy the extra reading is a incredibly fun game when it works
unfortunately this title has that rushed to deadline feel to it and it shows
the most common crash is the now infamous ghostmanagercpp error
for those without programming experience the cpp extension is industry standard for c plus plus the programming language the game was coded in
the ghost manager is the part of the game that handles the respawning of dead players
thats right youve just made the ultimate sacrifice to destroy your opponents artillary youre about to go back into fray when bleep the whole game is gone lost never to be recovered
if the goal was to leave players dumbfounded frustrated and wanting to return the game to their point of purchase then this battlefield ctd bug is a fivestar gem
while you might get over the first    crashes with a shrug the bug takes its toll
when youve crashed    times youll pack this game up into cold storage and wait for a patch
of course patching isnt a strong point either
no sooner did ea release patch  the following day they had to release an emergency  patch to fix of all things a memory overrun problem
thats a programming  mistake
so im not holding out a lot of faith in this title
my advice is that this title is too young to waste your money on
ea has already announced an expansion pack so save your money
this game is sure to be bundled at a later date with the expansion pack and the bugs worked out
when that day comes be the first one in line it will be worth your money and time
until then proceed at your own riskat first the game wasnt installing correctly
it took  installs to get it to work then it asks me to sign up for account which i did and it said the email was tooken i play other ea games with this email so i retreieved my account which was some game called bf heros and my name had  in it
which i cant change and it wouldnt allow me to make a new account becuase the cd key was tooken with the stupid  name from bf heroes wtf were they thinking
steam origin is the futurenow some servers boot me out of the game becuase of my name dosel which i have no control over so big middle finger to dice for this crap gamesony online entertainment took the matrix online offline in   this product will not work in any way without their servers being up  running and many cumulative patches applied to both the launcher and the game
therefore unless you are looking for a collectible disc to stick on a shelf do not expect this game to work
the game that shipped in this box was very quickly overhauled when shortly after launch wb interactive dropped the game into sonys lap and let them figure out what to do with it
it had  years of patches and still many bugs before the plug was finally pulledthis game is really boring and the combat is terrible a typical rare game with great graphics and crappy gameplay
at least its not  of thier usual collectathonsconkers bad fur day is known for being the sole m rated release at least that i know of by nintendorareware
the game contained curses free if bleeps minus the f bomb blood sexual references death everything a teenagers expectations in a videogame are
in an attempt to remake the game for the xbox in  the creators took a step down and indirectly ruined it
they bleeped out most every curse word
i dont know about you but i all the bad stuff i can get in an m rated game and then a remake also rated m takes the curses out
also new updated xbox graphics make the game look a bit more realistic
to many this may be praiseworthy but to me a fan of the nintendo  era of gaming these new graphics look hideous
the nintendo  versions graphics are much better looking to me
basically try to get a copy of the original nintendo  game if you can
its much better than this dumb remakethis is an overall good game but it suffers from horrid online lag
textures also can appear murky
another issue is that it crashes a lot
sometimes it just takes you to your desktop and other times it completely crashes your system freezing which forces you to do a hard shutdown which could damage your systemhowever this is the fault of the developers not the selleri ordered this on a thursday and received it on a saturday
great sellerwhen it comes to the game i highly recommend the console versions
the pc version just has too many problemsthe game was played or attempted after running patch it would sometimes crash to desktop but more often just freeze requiring a total shutdown and reboot
my pc has a ghz processor with  gb memory and an ati radeon hd  mb graphics card
i reset the graphics in the game to xx from xx
that didnt help
it would freeze every  minutesfor the short time i actually played the game it was a lot of fun
it is first person perspective prefer tpp but when in a vehicle you can switch to tpp
the inventory and economics seemed decent
the graphics were not great but acceptable for a rpg
the voice acting was poori loved the setting
i get tired of always fighting goblins zombies and aliens
how about making a western
ancient greece
feudal japan
there are so many areas that the rpg makers havent exploredif the game had crashed to desktop every hour or two i would still be playing it but rebooting every  minutes was too much
apparently a big feature of the game is that there are no load times as you move around in the game world
i would gladly trade waiting a few seconds for loading in exchange for a more stable gameps  does anyone know what the difference is between boiling point and bp road to helli was looking forward to this game for a few months reading the previews on the game sitewhy
this is not a good gamebad graphicsboring gameplayto many bugs to mentionstupid storyi can go on and on but there is no comparison with san andreasif you want to waste your money buy that not this junki rather play san andreasand you should tothis was a good game came complete but it did not have the proper description about what system i mean operating that i could use it for
there fore i was unable to play it seller should be more descriptive next timethis game is seriously dated
and i dont mean in terms of being an xbox game  i was a huge fan of biowares knights of the old republic another xbox game with slightly lower production value and lots of irritating bugs on an xbox  this game is bugfree
the problem is that the gameplay is kind of like an s arcade beatemup
theres a quick attack button a slow attack button and a dodge button
ok theres more to it then that and the interface is done really well and its kind of like the best version of streets of rage that will ever be created
its very fun at first but there just isnt enough depth to support more than a few hours of gameplay and before too long it becomes a grindproduction values are very good given that its an original xbox game
the setting of the universe is interesting theres a million characters you can talk to and they all have lots of dialogue
however it feels overly lengthy at times and since you dont talk yourself dialogue feels like a talking head that pops up into the game and gives you a new questi expected more of an rpg like shenmue or final fantasy
this is a lot more hackandslash
not my thingi gave this game a shot and after a few months ive decided that you are much better off going with the older nascar season  it just feels more authentic
graphics are fine on nsr
the tracks are beautiful but the cars look pretty chunky
physicswise the cars handle well but it is really hard to get any of the cars loose
i didnt try any of the online racing
i personally do not like ea
they come off as arrogant
they buy all of the rights for nasacar and put out a mediocre product
sure each year there are improvements but even five years from now i cant see them coming close to the quality of the original paprus product
just my two cents actually i am completely confused as to all the praise this game received
everyone has been raving about the ownerdynasty modes as being so deep and realistic
basically what the game has is every major league team plus aaa aa and a teams also included
this sounds great when you consider there is a disabled list contract negotiations and personalities to deal with
the problem and imo its a game breaking problemthey dont have any waivers options or callup senddown rules
i am baffled that people can find this to be a realistic simulation of running a baseball team
you can send players down to the minors one day then bring them back up the next
essentially you have access to a full  man roster on all four teams giving you  players to use everyday
that is insanely stupid
forget about a five man rotation folks say hello to a forty man rotation
ea sports took the time to add all of these minor league affiliates and didnt spend any time adding basic and necessary rulesto say im being nit picky is really turning a blind eye here
at the very least they could have added one realistic rule to fix this problem
even if you want to skip waivers and options they could have made you keep players in the minors for at least two weeks after being sent down a real mlb rule
that would prevent havig complete access to your minors everyday
very simple yet ea didnt bother with it
who cares about the gameplay when the ownerdynasty modes are  unrealistic and stupid
big deal they have a disabled list
where is the strategy in player movement when you have access to four full teams
ootp for me i guessthere is no reason to purchase this game when so many other worthwhile games make better investmentsthe graphics are dated
not horrible but not excitingthe gameplay is weak
awkward control issues in rd person modethe game is too easy
enemy ai is barebones plus your too strong
your health bar barely drops unless you stand still and let enemies tear into you
you can get through the entire game barely taking a dent if you get good with head shotsthis game is so easy to defeat  that you can cruise through most of the game by running up to each enemy and pressing the quick kill button youll see a brief animation of the enemy in question being shot being stabbed or having his neck broken
sure youll take a few shots while you run up to each bad guy but since you can just interrogate a couple of guys to get that health back youre rarely in need of health on the games normal difficulty setting
the harder setting limits your ability to do this  but it is still too easythe punisher can go into slaughter mode which slows the game down a bitcan anyone say bullettime rip off
while in it youll regain some of your health and drop your guns in favor of a neverending supply of knives that you can throw into the faces of enemies with stunning accuracy
again too easy
you can grab any enemy for use as a human shield
though doing this slows down your movement so much that its not very usefulbottomline a sad attempt to put a new spin on an old concept
you have been here and you have done this
some very good games are coming in late february to april
i would save my money and wait for themwhy why why i loved the first they should of just left it alne
the worst part about the game is the stupid ass earthquake that happen ass soon as u punch someone the whole screen shakes 
dumb
i gave it two stars just because the graphics are good thats itthe idea behind this ep is fantastic its too bad it was literally harpooned by the bugs
only a small number of bugs can be blamed on custom content numerous others are due to internal errors in the code of the game itself
reach a certain number of character files in your neighborhood folderabout  and youll be plagued by frustrations such as the final exam bug the undead elder bug and the sim graduated but wont go home to the original neighborhood bug
kicky bags get stuck only to be remedied by bulldozing the lot and greek members develop amnesia where they lose important memories like their first kiss as a teenwhat has eamaxis done to resolve these issues
first they said that they couldnt provide a separate downloadable patch that it was too hard
a patch would be included in the next ep nightlife effectively coercing consumers to pay out more money to get their game to work
then as sims fans expressed their outrage eamaxis promised to attempt to make such a patch but it still wont be available until sometime after the release of nightlife if ever at all
i was able to rectify my bug issues with third party bugfixes
i appreciate those modders taking the time to make the game playable but it was truly eamaxis responsibility to provide timely support for their game
i am waiting at least a month before i consider purchasing nightlife because i want to see the following
a free downloadable patch to those whove already bought university and what it will correct
what the patch included in nightlife will correct hopefully it will be the same as the downloadable patch and is nightlife going to cause any new unpleasant messes from code errors
eamaxis working to treat consumers with more respect timely support for their product like other software companies such as atari and microsofti never expected the game to be bug free i simply expected eamaxis to have a better attitude about supporting the product they have sold to us
especially since the errors are of their own makingits about a fifty  sixty hour game
a typical rpg with no great innovations and exceptionally easy battles
what atelier has going for it is the elemental combination and synthesis system
its extremely complicated and by itself will be the majority of your game experience
expect many many fetch this reagent quests
it gets repetitive
the battles were too easy and enemy selection is limited
the enemies puni are present in both the very first area of the game and the very last areas of the game and every other area for that matter
i found this tedious
there is no puni conspiracy or anything like that only lack of monster varietythe characterization didnt really connect with me oddly the characters that i liked the most and were the best developed werent even in my party
they were shop owners you have to find items to synthesize into new items for
the music was decent and i loved the opening anime music video
however youll find some glitches with the voices including a glitch that can ruin the endingdidnt like not being able quickteleport into areas which you could use the teleport network to get out of fetch quests remember
 the randomness of new formulas being added at the shops took me forever to get magic pipe for example and the tedium of converting mana stones into useful abilities
things i did like included a couple very funny and challenging side quests the awesome personality of the water sprite at the item exchanging spring and some of the voice comments in combat by the characterskeep in mind that atelier is not a true nippon ichi title it was translated by nis america but released by a company called gust
i do not recommend this game or the atelier series of games if you prefer challenging combat in your rpgsi am glad to see nis make something other than strategy rpgs
the problem is that the strategy games they make are a lot better than this gamethe story of the game is very solid
the storyline is nothing new though
it has the old evil is coming theme
of course your main character is the last that can use a dying technique that is needed to save the worldthe battle system is very simplistic at best which is ok  you have to extract elements from objects to make potions and other things to battle with
they give you two battle options
these are to attack or defend
the battle system is old school turn basedthe art style and backgrounds are reminicent of secret of mana totally unrelated snes gamewhere this game falls really short is the fact that your character is two dimentional  this is not a bad thing by itself but it tries to be three dimentional
the game randomly pops up elements and items
you can actually exit a building and extract all items then enter the building reexit and extract the items again
you can build up an infinite supply of elements like this
the problem is the way the environment is set up it is hard to see where you are going
often times there are areas that you can jump to that you cant see because the scenery is in your way
this gets annoying very fast
the character doesnt interact with the environment very well
i got stuck in a wall jammed up on top of a ladder and just couldnt find the right place to jump to get where i was going several times
i think if you could rotate your view there would be no problem
i still am not sure why items keep popping in locations that you cant get tothe fact that the main character likes to yell out barrel everytime he checks a barrel is also very annoyingi recommend staying away from this game
i havent seen a good game with the word mana in it for a long time now
i would like nippon ichi entertainment to try again
i think the potential is there they just need to try something different than what they have made herepossible spoilersso here we are in a game that would explain what happened in  digital devil saga and put characters in final episode of the story
i really liked how game sets off
you are about to protect humans as lower caste from demonic high caste i like being good guy
it is not raining anymore
there are kids in the game and normal people
there is matrixdunebladerunnerish  feel to the ambientand thats it
technically you have to start leveling up from level one and bying mantras from the beginning
no importing of old characters into  new game
even mantra grid is not the same so that you can navigate easily if you played part one
even if you had  million macca money at the end of dds and spells like magic repel dyne elemental spells rich inventory it is all gone
sniff
no devourer  too
labyrinths are vast like in first part bosses are smart there are puzzles with switchesas much as i liked first part because of it second one is too similar and i said not again after seeing same schemestemplates againi decided that this game be my last atlus title to complete but i am really bored
if i dont post more in my review its probably because i stopped playing this sequel  after just four hours
too similar to part one and no funthey should have done ff type of thing or smt nocturne type of thing similar environment and weirdness in game  but new characters connected little better into story of part one
this way you can learn after  hours what was point of dds one and loose interestdo my impressions originate in fact i beat persona  and digital devil with small pause in between so i got bored of atlus rpgsif you still decide to playread solutions to answering dialogues
here you can make mistake like thatcielo and gale are only ones who wont leave you others leave and come backget mantra grid from faq off the web or buy guideget devourer no devouring no atma pointsif you can get crimson box and have  in cash save buy box in city and hope to get rich ring
money is scarce
get esotheric mantra  unlocked quick it is purple one  down right of protection or in other words south of devourerreading faq i understood that you have to do most imp things before coming to sun
sun has big and small nodes and shop and nodes are equal to terminals
sun is good to level up make sure you have null charm dyne magics null death and expel
you needed them to beat airport anywayimpressions after beating gamegoodlast level was wow
i liked the ending i liked how main boss looks like
thumbs up for graphic designers
if whole game had been like thisbadyou spend a lot of time    to level up and when you have right spells and good stats you can devastate next boss and then you read faq to see what you need for next boss i wish i didnt have to hunt for mantras  game system where you level up personas or parasites by using them or getting experience was betterbosses i beat spoilers aheadelephant guy have earth repel and tera
eight arms attack w whatever except attack command and do mediahorselike guy in concentration camp have media force repel and zio ready
for me  chars were at lvl  no need to level up to after this get mutual karma for everyone spend  hours or soheliodrome inside karma society trio of monsters take oneargilla must have tera or terazi and media roland must have agilao cielo media and some attack
roland shoots agilao to kill doglike creature who heals left side of screen argilla does tera against snake woman and media sometimes cielo supports
dont leave snake last she does dyne
kill healerthe dog  with fire paralelly hit snakewoman with tera and kill stonelike guy last
set mutual karma for gale and serph
trio take twowatch out
they will hit with ziotype magic combo so have someone do void electricity
fire boss with two fire dogskill dogs do void fire
if you do repel fire boss energy with recover
keep using this strategy till boss is down

its not better
theres nothing new and no excitementpariahs a title that a few people have been waiting for
in the end its probably better if we waited longer
the game doesnt really break any molds or even really trythe graphics are good enough from a distance but look cheap and thrown together at closer distances
its obvious the unreal engine needs to be put to rest once and for all
havoc adds a little level of fun but what good is it really when the enemies vanish practically before they hit the ground
weapon and player character animations are smoothly done but nothing really awe inspiringalthough the first song you hear is quasi entertaining it gets old fast after looping for an hour over and over
the worse offense in the sound department has to be the enemy barks the programmers gave enemies about three phrases for the entire game and it is etirely common to hear ten enemies say the same exact quote as you kill them in succession 
doe rae me fa so long sucka
is corny the first time you hear it and just as bad the millionth per levelin essence it feels like youre gunning down the same zig zagging target over and over
ambient noises weapons and voice acting pull the experience together
the weapons genuinly sound lethal and vehicles do sound powerfulone of the games selling points is the ai
every interview from creators claim that the ai is among the best on the market
its more like the most dissapointingly mediocre
enemies ignore walls in front of their faces and fire missiles trying to kill you
they also dont coordinate like in other games
between mediocre enemy ai and poorly designed levels i found myself accomplishing half of the game and wishing at some point it would start becoming enjoyablefinally ive read a lot of bravado about how hollywood screen writers are collaborating to create a compelling story for pariah
okwheres the evidence
half way through the game you know as much as you did just reading the back of the box
cutscenes dont really tell you whats going on and most of your objectives are to find karinain all pariah leaves a bad after taste and the sense of being scammed for  that could have better been invested in another game
if this was a game three years in the making the pariah team must have spent two of those years fooling around
the verdict bland graphics average soundtrack inexcusable ai and no real plot
look for it in the bargain bin in a week or two before spending the full stella deus is a tactical rpg from atlus
the game plays very similar to past tactical rpgs like final fantasy tactics tactics ogres and disgaea
unlike traditional roleplaying games where the hero character and the supporting npcs who join him can roam the roads forests and lands between cities and regions freely tactic games pretty much just linear roadlinks which takes a character icon from one marker to the next signifying a cities on the world maplike all tacticsbased rpgs stella deus uses job classes which can be levelled into much stronger ones with class name changes included
this is done through constant battles and the exp gained from successful attacks melee ranged and magic supporting actions and use of items
stella deus has a way of creating high levels gear and weapons from current inventory which is pretty exhaustive in the amount of combinations can be used
though some combinations just doesnt make sense in that some powerful weapons and gear can be made by combining a weak lowlevel item with a mediumlevel one while combining two highlevels can get a player a useless lowlevel item
as fun as the item creation system is this small flaw can make things frustrating at timesthe voice acting in stella deus is one the worst ive heard in games so far
the people who did the voices for the hero the supporting characters and some of the npcs i can only sum up as being belowpar and just downright amateurish
it sounds as if the actors hired were just reading what was put in front of them without any sort of emoting required
it doesnt help that the story itself is pretty dull and uninterestingthe gameplay itself is pretty much your standard tacticsstyle grid battle where the player positions his party as strategically as possible to gain an advantage on prepositioned enemy units
after a few battles its really simple to figure out just how to position your party so that you pretty win every battle with little or no troubleall in all stella deus doesnt matchup to the great tactics rpgs like final fantasy tactics tactics ogre and disgaes
it doesnt even come up to the same level as the secondtier tactics rpgs like la pucelle makai and phantom brave
id recommend this game as a rental but even then id only do so if a person really wants to try itif it were  and this were a nintendo game it might be ok  but for an xbox game it is very lightweight and poorlyimplemented
its on par with some of the late s pc shooters early nintendo games or the first versions of wolfenstein but is almost painfully lowtech when it comes to game play on an xbox
i got it for  but i would not recommend you buy it for more than seems i have a huge difference of opinion compared to most here but anyways on to why i gave it a low rating
first off and most obvious is loading times
it could have been avoided i believe because maps werent that huge and it didnt look like way too much detail and information being processed
graphics i dont have a gripe with so ill skip that
dialogue in my opinion was terrible
it was extremely static and just felt scripted
regardless of the fact that it was
it didnt really give me a sense that people were talking as opposed to that they had lines they were supposed to say
storyline and setup was equally terrible and overused
a main character with amnesia
and they just left it that way
the main character never even had presence at all
he just said huh
ok the whole game with exception to battles when he first puts on one of the rings
also you dont get to know anything anything about the characters until their specific chapter section comes up which is really sad because i never got to feel attached to anyone and once their story is done you dont get anything else from them anyways
next is the way that the plot and surprises were released
everything was pretty much centered around one lead character and for some reason he knew everything but never revealed any of it until after it happened
he even says he knew when things were going to happen but chose not to tell anyone
i know some of you will say he had a perfectly good reason but its quite possibly the easiest way out of giving a good excuse for keeping information back
id get punched in the face if i did that to those guys
to end it all the ending was just meh
if you want to try a game worthy of my praise pop in baten kaitos on gamecube and turn off the voices
its got a fairytale feel to it at first which i thought was annoying and the card system felt awkward but its a game that makes you think and the style is awesome although story is kind of predictablei liked the prequel champions of norrath  realms of everquest and was looking forward to an innovative sequel in the return to arms
i was very disappointed to see that there is very little thats new in this version
except for the two new characters the characters look exactly the same as before with the same spells and abilities
the muchhyped total camera control amounts to false advertising in that it allows a very slight zoom and that is all
there is no visible improvement or innovative new feature at all
this game is showing its age and there are plenty of better alternatives out there like ratchet and clank  going commando and dynasty warriors  both available for under 
skip the overpriced and overhyped return to armsbecause i dont want to waste too much more time on this game
if youve played baldurs gate dark alliance youve played this one
theres a slight variation in the gear you can buy but if what you want is shopping head for the mall
the one selling point is the player aspect but both myself and my coplayer got bored half way through and the games been sitting on the shelf ever since
in my book if a games not making me want to call in sick its not doing its job
cheerschampions returns to arms had the advantage of the success of the first game champions of norrath using a hugely improved gameplay and mechanism of baulders gate
however returns to arms itself is a very disappointing instalment for the seriesif there is going to be another onebasic gameplay wise it is very similar to the first game
however the twick and twist that was put into the sequel completely removed a lot of the fun factors offered by the original title
you can import your old characters from the first one into the new one but then the abilities you earned from the first one was toned down
for example you will find the same skill now takes up more mana and if it is a summon eg
the hammer of wrath for the cleric class it stays around much shorter than before
there are new skills to be learnt but then since they require higher level to unlock it is a test of patience if you start a new character for the gamethe portal map approach didnt really do much good to the game apart from making some very taxing side quests available for players
but some of them are so difficult that you will just find them more like a frustration than fun
even random enemies in the main story eg
archers in the last dungeon could kill you with two hits
if this is the way that snowblind thinks could prolong the game it is a bad move
also the worst nightware is the inclusion of stealth unnecessarily inside the game
especially all enemies in the stealth level is one hit kill on you disregard your level
stealth works in action rpgs like zelda and beyond good and evil because it goes natural with the game but in champions it looks awkward and at the same time frustrating
just think if someone just like hackn slash why would they want to play a very difficult stealth level in the middle of the gamethe game also has some very difficult bosses that can cause you to throw your controller so get a sturdy controller before start playing it
prices for stuff are as steep as they used to be and most of the time you can only get budget items from enemies even in the courageous and champion modes
also the fact that you cant repeat the same level again and again like the last game and you cant import characters into a game once you started it made the whole gameplay very inflexible and annoying
for example you are in the middle of an adventure a friend came over and want to join
that could not be done unless you start a new game
this lack of flexibility compared with the first one is a huge put off factor for the fans of the seriesin all fans of the first game will still play this game but it certainly does discourage people to get the third one if there is any at all
the first champions game got every aspect right but the sequel just ruined everything
but one thing is consistent between both games  you could not believe how many bugs are there in the game
certainly more serious qc is needed for snowblind in the future
or maybe qcs there are all snow blindedright so i read some other reviews on this page and i said to myself i have ghost recon and vegas hey wheres the good ai
wheres the tactical planning
this r is more of a gunning game where you just run through a linear map shooting people
but some unrealistic stuff ruin this there are still some good gunning games out there ai
enemy ai just stands there
your teamates blame you for shooting them while they get in front of you in the first place
breach and clear
call it breach and stand there and throw and clear
teamates open the door all the way yes they dont open it a bit and then use that small opening to throw a grenade
and take about  seconds to throw a grenade which usually ends up with a incapacitated teammate full of grenade sharpenel
gameplay
all the missions are like this go in to rescue hostages
kill bad guys
rescue hostages
go to extraction pointnothingthank you for reading this poor reviewno matter how fun a game is starforce cd protection kills it and your pc toosearch boycott starforce and youll see
horribleill now carefully avoid all starforce games
they can kill your dvdrw drive rendering it useless
copy protection only hurts the legitimate user
pirates are gonna copy it anyways
whats the point of destroying my pcdont buy this game or any game with starforce protection in itthis game is not the awful piece of junk which you are reading about in other reviews
but its not really an r game
in short this game is an extremely generic run around and blast tangos shooter
there are some fun moments here and there as you might expect
a few weeks after having last played it i really dont remember a single mission individually
all were based up on going into some building blasting a bunch of carboncopy tangos and either defusing a bomb or rescuing some hostages
i seem to recall one mission had a long slog through a garage while another was in some sort of cavethe big departure is that you do not plan any of this
you are dropped into a spot and told to rescue hostages or do some other such b movie standard mission
you are led down a linear path to the objective after which a new mission is given
its all totally generic and forgettable
you do get to choose your weapons and kit loudout but you cant do any of the extreme customization as could in rogue spear or raven shield
i am not sure why ubisoft is going down this path
part of the appeal of the older r games was the strategy and planning aspect
this game to me looks like a port from a console and it shows badly
its very simplistic and linear
ubisoft is sticking it to the console fans who made this a great franchise in the late s and early sgraphics are quite sharp in the game and the voice acting and sounds are ok as well
but shortly after i finished the first few missions i simply put the game down and reloaded call of duty  theres really nothing here you cannot find in any other special forces themed shooter
this is probably in the discount bin now so take a pass on it and also rainbow six vegas and grab call of duty  that game is what a special forces shooter should bei usually can find something to like about even the most poorly received pc games and with many enjoyable hours spent years ago on r raven shield i was eager for another title in the illustrious rainbow six franchise
i read the reviews and as negative as they were i decided to spend a few bucks on this
sadly i couldnt find much to like about lockdown
the graphics are fairly good and the game generally runs smoothly aside from some audio glitches usually at the start of missions and a couple of crashes
a few r hallmarks are here namely equipment selection and some squad command options but this could just as well be a solo shooter
as has been mentioned abundantly the ai is terrible with enemies and squad members alike walking into the line of fire for no apparent reason
the few commands you can issue to your squad are rarely followed to the point that youll end up running through each mission more or less solo
on a couple of maps one or more of my squad mates would get hung up on inanimate objects not rejoining me until the next level of the missionthere are so few missionsmaps and theyre so linear that i was almost thankful that the game was quite short
i dont know what lockdown initially sold for when it was first released but i feel like a sucker for wasting  on it
even a dollar would be better spent elsewhereas a huge fan of clancy games i mistakenly bought this one
the graphics are fairly nice but the on rails feel and constant trigger point ai is frustrating
the ai is some of the worst ive ever seen in a game
your team is so stupid youll want to just keep sending them back to the start point to keep them alive and out of your way
the enemy ai also becomes boring in how they always do and say the same thing over and over
i turned the game difficulty all the way up and its still just a yawn festival
online verses play is fun but good luck finding anyone out there
dont waste your  or time on this oneim really not sure why people like this game
its just full of these mini touch games that take a few seconds like hitting flies pulling strings popping balloons and the storyline takes such a long time and its not that interesting either
the mini games really arent fun
maybe if youre incrediblyyy bored but with the wait of wario going to places for the storyline it just increases your boredomthis game had potential but it is just too repetitive and easy
in the first wario ware game wario ware mega microgames it was hard to beat all of the levels and unlock all of the unlockables
there was also much more variation in the microgamesthis game rather than being enhanced by the addition of the microphone which is built in to the ds and the touch screen is limited by them
all of the microgames involve either the touch screen or the microphone
that means that the microphone level for example has you blowing into the microphone over and over regardless of what the microgame isthe unlockables arent nearly as good as they were in the first wario ware either
it was really cool to be able to unlock the full version of dr mario
its not as cool unlocking a metronome calculator and yoyo
there are more unlockables but theyre really only worth playing with onceoverall this game was a big disappointment
fortunately wario ware twisted is coming out for game boy advance next month and it sounds like it will be much betteri really want to like this game
its stylusactiongame gameplay is very very solid probably even better than the gameplay of kirbys canvas curse
but this game does so so very much less with the engine than the great game canvas curse doessome people will find enough satisfaction from this game playing for high scores in each of the four modes
as for me i am only good enough at the game to complete one of the modes and what i see just isnt enough to keep me playing to improve
four modes  thats what this game has
the goal is slightly different in each one
but each one has just two stages  mario falling and yoshi carrying mario
and once you take a single hit from an enemy its game over and start from the beginning or midpointif you want this kind of stylus gameplay guiding the hero and keeping him safe with the stylus get kirby canvas curse for ds
though yoshi probably has the better play engine kirby does so much more with his engine that he puts yoshi to shamei really enjoyed rt but this expansion pack is very hard to master and has a few bugs of its own
it takes forever to actually make a water fall work and is very frustratingyou have the ability to build rides through terrain now but this to is virtually impossible to accomplish
and often the rides wont function
i receive constant popups saying the ride stations are not long enough for the ride cars even though you can see the cars sitting in the station
terrain is a major problem as que lines no longer line up with the ground forcing you to spend alot of time trying to adjust the surrounding land to the proper heightthis expansion pack if anything is very frustrating much more so than the original problems with rtin the first  version of this game it was very easy to build through mountains and underground those days are long gone here
unless you have hours to spend mastering this new stuff you may want to think twice before you add this packdated graphics and no updates make for a lowprice game
you get what you pay forthis is a resourcehogging sow of a game a gluttonous bottomless pit waiting to consume your pc
i can only assume the developers must have set up each of their effects to run on a different server
you want fog
sure pal thatll take another gig of ram
its unimaginable how a game of only above average graphical detail can completely disable perfectly good computers while better looking games run smoothlyand lets not mention the sound effects hit detection ai storyline on and on
the only value this thing has is as a learning tool of how not to make games
which would be like buying a yugo to learn how not to make cars
which you wouldnt do
so donti am a big fan of massively multiplayer online games and plaync should be more than happy to have customers like me
city of heroes city of villains guild wars lineage ii are some of my favorite games and i did review some of them with  and  stars
i can understand as an old and experienced gamer that the more complicated are the games the more bugs you are going to deal with
what i cant understand is how a game with  years of development can have so many bugs and specially when hundreds of gamers like me we supported the development of the game not only dedicating our time but paying for the preorder version
there are no excuses for treating the advanced gamers which is your target group like thison the top of all plaync has created a very nice online adventure game called support
each time i used it in the past i was forwarded from one server to another from us support to the european support etc
then i was getting a ticket number i was logging in my support site and then i was checking for my answer
nice easy and requires no time at allah
i forgot to tell you about the game
the concept is really good you choose a hero and a customized vehicle with hightech futuristic weaponry in order to fight the mutated creatures and bandits
you will be able to participate in epic battles and wars over the control of the regions
you can develop advanced crafting skill you will able to fully customize your vehicle and you are going to develop your abilitiesthe environment is a devastated earth where you can blow up buildings trees and other structures and fortunately you never run out of ammothe game includes pvp player vs player interaction clansolo arena dueling for fame and fortunenow please do not get me wrong the game is very good the only problem is that it is unfinished
i would recommend waiting until they finish it first and then you will buy the full version
trust me when they will finish it i promise i will change my review but until then try it only if you dont mind to crash your system every time you playokif youre looking for mindless look around a corner and shoot bad guys have fun with thistheres no mapping
this means you have no idea what the terrain size of the building etc is
so this makes the game pretty linear
theres one or  ways to get to the doorway to the next boardteammatesyour teammates even if you tell them to hold will come running to where you are if you fire a round this usually gets them killed
when i told them to hold then threw a grenade they ran to the grenade and diedweaponstheres only one weapon with a silencer
sniping on a console sucks
give me back my pc and track ball sniping
even on the normal level one hit to my teammates was killing them and they just stood there
im on the last sniping board and enemies are firing on my team as the enter the screen which gives me zero time to snipe them before they kill my teammate
if one dies you fail
no other boards fail you if a member dies
enemiespretty much look alike
most are very similar
although the ai is smart bad guys spawned behind me after i secured a room
so they didnt have to be too smart to spawn and pick off my teamcheatsdont trust the cheats screeni got curious and used my points for invisibility
it doesnt make the whole team invisible
they get shot just as fast
the cheats screen says your whole team is invisible
nuh uhone shot kills works fine thoughgood  the cinematics were pretty good
you learn more about the team membersokgoodany more good stuff to saynopewell this game has so few pros that ill start with them decent graphicsgood weapon selection ok rag doll physicsthe cons however are what make the game
the biggest problem is the game is obviously intended to be a tactical shooter but is actually a run and gun
you have all the tools a tactical shooter requires special grenades advanced team commands decent weapons
but after the first level youll learn that the ai is mindnumbingly stupid and you really need no tactics
they have ridiculously bad aim and you can walk straight into a room full of them without consequence
there are no tools that let you take cover effectively like in a later installment rainbow six vegas
it isnt satisfying taking out enemies mainly because they fall too easy im not talking about one bullet kills thats fine
im talking about the fact that they run out into the open and just stand there not returning fire
the environments are dull and boring seriously who sets a level in a parking garage
and your team mates are almost as stupid as the enemy
there is a fairly large selection of weapons the problem is most of them are the sameoverall not a very satisfying or good gaming experience he who has no namehere is why rainbow  lockdown is not worth the money quick and simple
its too easy  even on elite level you can push through it stand in front of people firing at you and nothing happens
to unlock levels in multiplayer you have to beat them first on single player
the guns look like cartoonsghost recon  summit strike was much much betteri am a huge fan of the rainbow series and the first rainbow  for the xbox is one of my favourite games so i was excited to hear about a new one coming out that allowed you to do such things as customize your teammates and other cool things
how wrong i wasso much has changed from the previous games that the only similarities are the characters from the rainbow series everything else is differentthe pov has changed so that everything is through goggles this is not a big deal like all the reviews make it out to be the outline of the goggles do not get in the way of any of the view but when you get shot bullet holes appear in the googles glass obscuring all the view
i do not know what kind of goggles these are but if the person was shot  times in the eye making these holes they would probably be deadthe gun selection has been severly limited and although the names are different from the other rainbow games they are just different varients and that is why the names are different
it did seem that they took away all the popular guns like the ga mm and others and added many smaller machine pistols
i can not speak for other people but i would rather be killing people with a huge assault rifle than with a gun the size of my hand
you can only use a sniper rifle when the game lets you and the are next to no guns with scopes or silencersthe ones that do have them would definitly not in real life
all the gun sight systems are left to the stock option of needle and hole sighting which is not typical of any special forces when they have red dots scopes and lasers
this does get annoying when lining up a target because most of the gun gets in the way when looking at an  enemythe controls have been drastically switched around which seems to be for no reason since no new button options were added making the relayout a pointless joke
the way they have changed the button configuration has made it awkward for old rainbow player the left trigger used to be for changing weapons now it throws grenadesreal nice when im surrounded by my teammates and i frag them on accidentit seems that the games controls have been made very similar to halo and other fps games just so that those people can get into it quickerthe graphics are in my opinion the biggest let down they arent as good as the others which is a shame because the others were quite good
the guns do not look realistic and instead look almost cartoon like the scopes on the very few guns that have them do not reflect light or interact with the environment in any way
every enemy is one of about  designs and the environment is nothing specialthe ai of both the team mates and the enemies is disgusting i dont understand how other reviewers can say that they are intelligent or that they set up traps because the most i have seen them do is miss constantly with their guns only a few feet away from me
the enemy are almost as stupid as your own team mates who in every gun fight hide and switch to the hold option causing you to go off without knowing that they are at the beginning of the map and you are at the endthe game would be semi decent if it were not the sequel to the other excellent rainbow games and its expectation of being better or at least the same smashed
the game is far too easy but i have found many glitches that have stopped me from progressing
on the fifth level a door jamned and the only way i managed to get through was by constantly running at it until i fell through it
other things like terrorists managing to shoot me whilst they are in the reload sequenceimpossible and the heart beat moniter only sometimes working properly have all dampened the gamethe reviews that have given it a low score are from people who have played the other rainbows like good games or expect better from xbox
the reviews that give it a good score are from people that are into quick fast paced games that sacrafice quality and realism for a game that can be beaten quickly and easilyi would recommend renting it because there are a few fun aspects to it but not enough to actually wish you had bought itit comes down to thiswill you conquer your foes through being kind or cruelwell not exactlythe first black and white game focused very much on creature development impressing neighbors and magical spells
you really did feel like you had a lot of power though the micromanagement and lack on information left you feeling less than omnipotentin black and white  game designers help you get more information about your settlements and of your opponents
additionally parenting has never been so easy due to a new meter system that lets you fine tune your creature training
in fact you can easily go back and change all of the knowledge your creature has acquired throughout the gameanother addition to the game is the use of military units now which is one of the biggest selling points for the game
imagine epic battles being fought with your creature leading the way destroying legions of soldiers with a single kickthe aspect of good vs evil all comes down to how you wish to conquer your foethrough proper city management and becoming a beacon on the hill or through armed conflict and forceful seizureunfortunately all of these new additions lead to little improvement in the fun factor of black and white the first disappointment in the game is your creature
while considerable time and effort was used with the creature in the previous title in black and white  you will find at times that he is completely unnecessary and even distracting to the game depending on what your goals are for the game
if you are playing in the good side your creature will be necessary to help defend your settlements or even to collect resources
while the defense is valuable the collection is not always
at times you have to carefully manage your resources including trees and you might find that your creature interferes with this
on the evil side you might find him very useful in destroying armies and leading troops
finally lionhead studios shows off the creatures as being very massive however you might not even notice much of a difference from the beginning of the game to laterthe second major disappointment is the military action
at times it can be very difficult to raise an army unless you are fully dedicated to being evil
instead of gripping battles being fought troops simply meet each other on the field and whoever has the greater strength wins
at times it is worth not having any army at all to take a simplereasier way of winning however this does not add to the fun of the gamethird as a god you are fairly limited in your influential abilities
in the previous title the use of magic was frequently executed in order to impress neighbors and even small things such as rocks being made magical were useful in order to achieve your goal
now when you want to influence others by good means the only way you can do it is by playing a sort of godly sim city game where you micromanage all aspects of the city and its development
one would think that as a god you might be able to practice some handsoff work and let your people have some freewill after all you can give this to your creaturein sum if there is any development at all between the two titles concerning you as a god it is that you have gained the ability to make great cities and send disposable soldiers outthe question is if the game is worth playing
the game does boast some fun moments such as the improved graphics and cool effects from the wonders you build i never get tired of seeing the siren miracle go off
however at times you will find yourself either sitting and waiting for events to take place watering trees or just wishing the level was over with already
as much as i hate to say it i would have to recommend holding off on purchasing this title
another game created around the same time is overlord where you can exercise more good vs evil funmy only hope is that a black and white  is in the works that makes you more godlike your creature more useful and impressive and lets you take a more hands off approachunless you want to use your hands for magicblack and white  has a lot going for it fairly unique ideas at least more unique than the rest of the crap the gaming industry is putting out though probably not as unique as say katamari damacy a great sense of humor wonderful graphicsuh oh what are we missing here
oh yeah
great controls and gameplay
two of the most important things in a game
oops
see black  white  is a very d game and while this looks great unfortunately it makes it a huge pain to move around between the  million camera views
now other games have been d and have been easy to move around in with a default camera view such as dawn of war
but you wont find that here
here instead of moving to the sides of the screen to scroll view duh every game has this feature its the most obviously easy way to get around an rts game for years and years you have to right click and then scroll the screen up down left or right
annoying
if you want to click a villager good luck because with  million camera views and depths to choose from all in d its hard to target your hand on to the villagerits not that i hate this game if it had a more simplified camera and controls id probably like it a lot
but im not going to spend all my time  energy in a game trying to get to the right camera depth so i can see whats going on and trying to grab things
heck it makes me want to go grab some console game where i dont have to deal with this annoying crapalright i never played the first black and white though i hear it was amazing
i never finished this one though i did get to the th island i lost interest after thatit gets repetative and doesnt stray much from your typical rts
i found my creature rather annoying until i figuered out he can really only do one thing very well
if you train him to be a gatherer and only that and train him to eat and sleep and such he will do it and take care of himself however if you also tell him to entertain the people and fight well at least in my case he over worked himself and was constantly exhausted until i would force him to sleepit was fun for a while but island after island had very little new content
i found unlocking things to be quite difficult
if you like rtss alot perhaps are a big fan of the civilazation series or the age of titans game then you might enjoy this but i dont recomend it otherwise
it was alright while it lasted but it just took too long to get anywhere exciting if it goes anywhere exciting at allthe graphics are pretty unimpressive for a game of is stature it took so long for them to release this you would think it would be stunning
the new age of empires is beautiful this leaves alot to be desired some of the graphics are down right pixilated and pointy where they shouldnt be at all
the game looks older then it is its disapointingofcourse you can decide whether to be benevolent or evil i went with being good it was easy to win if i just concentrated on building a very good city
i tried being more evil on another character i also found that pretty easy
its a huge time suckerthe impressive thing about it is how many people there are on the screen
there are alot of people on the screen at one time allowing for huge battles but that didnt really make up for the other short comings for me personally
it could have been much better i feeli bought this game the day it came
i was expecting it to be really awesome
yes the graphics are more intense but thats mainly it
theres tons of bugs not even the patch fixes all of it
the ai will taunt you with the same lines until you conquer him or win him over
in the last mission my influence ring would not expand beyond my walls so i was stuck without soldiers barely any walls and barely able to survive the first waves
i eventually gave up and uninstalled the gamei played all the orginal dooms and had lots of fun doing so
however i find that with doom  and the expansion pack i dont have fun playing it
the blood and violence is just to intense
newer and better graphics didnt help this game at all
the graphics engine is awsome but needs some blood and gore settingsthe orginal dooms had secret areas monsters didnt always jump out at you and more thought was placed into the level designes
ammo also wasnt laying all over the place and forced one to some planning
doom  just doesnt add up reminds me of the newer star wars moviesin conclusion  for some people the fun factor will be greatly reduced due to the violence factorrunning on ghz pentium on nvidia mxthis expansion pack runs slower than the main doom game for some reason
if doom is borderline on your rig you may want to avoid this expansion packthere are some new monsters in this expansion but nothing too exciting
there are some new weapons too but again nothing you havent seen before
one of them invites comparison with halflife  and its clear the hl implementation is better both in operation and use
again  i dont want to give too much away but youll know what i mean when you find itthe difficulty is pretty uneven
theres one point way too early with a teleporting bad guy  well youll recognize it when you get there  thats obviously much too difficult for its location in the gamethere are lots of contrived sections too such as twisty paths and spiked balls and the sequences of slamming walls
we expect better these daysits clear this game is mainly all the ideas that were not included in doom because they werent good enough
i know expansion packs generally fail to live up to the standards of the original games and we shouldnt be too suprised that this one is the samei paid  for it and im not sure it was really worth it
its not very imaginative long or goodafter reading the reviews on amazon and other sites i decided to try pariah
boy was i duped
this is the most boring and needlessly incomprehensible game ive played in a long time
at least with other games like halo and far cry you have some idea of why you are doing what you are doing in the game
pariah leaves you wondering  what is my motivation other than just trying to survive and  why am i playing this game in the first place
just like black it is nice graphicswise but really not worth the effort or trouble requiredthe intec psp screen protector would probably be ok if there were  screens included
you have to be wxtremely careful putting the screen protector on if not air bubbles
make sure the psp screen is clean and careful put the protector on
if you peal it off and try again it just doesnt work to wellthis game was pretty good but its weird
i mean the character use willie wampa cheeks
von clutch
pasadena o possum
psst
and this is  an aventure and  a racing game   retarded
this game is too easy as well
this game is good but oddthis game is ok at best barely a rental that will keep your intrest do not spend fifty buck on this game unless you play online you would be retarded if you did not plan to play it online
anyway the graphics are ok and tha ai is less that naverage well to cut to the chase everything about this game is either ok or mediocore
it just isnt very impressive
the biggest plus is online and even that will not blow you awaythis game is not worth muchimperial glory suffers from one major flaw it tries to be  games at once
first lets look at the most hyped aspect of the game the realtime battle engine
it is much like those found in the total war series but is not as effective
in rome total war the game really gave you a feeling that there were thousands of individual men fighting the battle but the engine in imperial glory makes it feel like youre pushing around a very sluggish single unit
also there is no real reason to build any infantry units during the game
in my experience if you rushed a couple of units of militia the weakest units in the game you could trample any army
i was frequently defeated even when i outnumbered the enemy by two or three and most of their units were militathe second game imperial glory tries to be is a world simulator like civilization  it also fails on this base greatly
no matter how mighty and farreaching your empire is you are still scraping by with the tiny numbers of resources at your disposal
the diplomatic model functions but there is very little personality to it
resource trading is awful as countries will more than likely never accept your generous offers of raw materials for gold but on their turn offer you the same
if you reject this countrys offer your overall standing with the country goes down sometimes even forcing you into war
the game also features a fairly robust tech tree and it is probably the best aspect of the game
the game also features quests
these quests are more or less like the wonders you construct in games like civ  or rise of nations and they give you similar results
the only problem with them is that by completing them you burn off a great majority of the few resources you havethe third game imperial glory attempts at is a naval warfare simulator
it plays out much much slower than the combat found in the wonderful sid meiers pirates and it is simply not fun
it has some good features but the combat is far too slow to enjoy them
also the enemy seems to have an advantage on the seas
for some reason i had two ships in pursuit of an enemy ship and in one salvo both ships were blown apart by enemy fire
this is neither fair or realisticfinally we come to the worst part of imperial glory
this game is touted as a simulation of the national and political turmoil of the early th century with epic wars being fought on all fronts but it has one major flawyou do not have to fight a single battle to win the gamethe game has a concept called peaceful annexation
this means that if you throw enough money to a country they will quickly and quietly become part of your empire
i played the game for a little over  game years each turn is a month so  turns and i never ever had a battle
ever
i never even had the slightest threat of battle until i kept making countries mad by proposing resource deals
thats right the game can go on without a single battle on your side and you can still win the game
this makes the game very dull and it forces the game to neglect its muchtouted d battle enginein conclusion if you played the demo of the game please understand that actual fighting is about  of the game and most of the game is spent looking at a board waiting to get enough resources to build a small army that will soon be destroyed by men who do not even use gunsi got this game hoping for a great story as all the reviews were raving about it
but i got bored with the gameplay
this game is so linear that all your caracter can do is move forward turn back and shoot at first person viewmost of the time youll find your character walking forward until you see some sort of crossroad which gives you options to manipulate objects talk to people or take corners and go into rooms
you cannot turn left or right in between just turn back
when you come across an enemy you must turn to st person view and shoot it but you cant move while shooting
this game lacks the freedom of movement of most games
even d games have more freedom of movement
this makes the repetitive comment of your assistant quite appropriate we are in a tight spot
gameplay feels old school when comptuers arent that powerfulanyway kudos for capcom for coming up with such a creative game
you dont see games that go away from the mainstream these daysfirst off all the people that have tried to ban this game and others like it without even seeing it or playing it this is just an example of how ignorant you are
you base your actions upon what you hear and read about a product without ever bothering to try the actual prodcut
shame on you
and all youre doing in the end is generating more sales for  bad games if they are bad
the best way to stop bad products is no one buy themnow with the rant out of the way on to the game reviewits not that great
many of us gta type game fans waited more than two years for this being led to believe it would be similar that is open ended with a variety of things to do and freedom to explore a virtual world
would you escape the ghetto and get revenge on your familys killers are freeze or clean up the city and save lives as a copthe actual game is nothing more than a linear first person shooter where you have to kill several enemies per level before they kill you
the ai is horrible
you have no choices
you cant drive anywhere
you have to hit enemies like  headshots to kill them usually before you can do that youre dead because even from a mile away they can hit you with accuracy
it sucks
dont waste your moneythe best game in my opionion so far is grand theft auto san andreas
for those of you who whine about how bad and violent it is that part is up to the player
if you want you can stay in los santos for months not kill a single person and make millions of dollars betting at the otb and driving the taxi buying all the safehouses working out at the gym etc
and not kill one person if you dont want to
so i say again try products for yourself before you try to ban them
its part of being a grown up
but youll never undertand
peacethis game was fun and the graphics are great but game play fun is limited
in about  hours of playing i had unlocked every bonus item
while you may get a few days of enjoyment from this game its definitely now worth buyingare you totally down with becoming a stressedout discontent computer programmer who after revealing his taste for sad guitar music and nietzche gets crimped up in a world painted in darkness ancient and angry aztec gods and cybernetic ghost beetles at work
optimistic and wooleye blinded reviewers hype indigo as an interactive movie a never before seen game experience et al
its just a game combining the matrix aztecs end of world philosophy and cult practices into one humdrum spectacle
my prophecy this game will be forgotten
and mccain will win in  continuing his promise to carry americas war on islam from iraq through iran into afghanistan and beyond while ignoring the gal
price on regular gasif youre looking for something innovative or interesting this game definitely isnt where to go youre the hulk and you have to pick up cars run up buildings throw stuff ya know
it actually sounds a lot more fun than it is in practice to me at least
i didnt feel any visceral joy in the process
it felt like just another typical runofthemill mediocre ps action game to me and this game really shows how far superior the xboxs graphics are to pss
compare the graphics of ninja gaiden to this game there is simply no contestthis was fun for a few hours but it got old pretty quick it just started to feel very repeatitive and it doesnt look that great to smash things anyhow cause the free roam world just looked a little cheap it all looks like a very crisp psone game to me
i guess im not a huge fan of the hulk in particular his diehard fans will be totally loving this
it was fun to throw stuff and kick puny humans around but after i ripped a car apart and made it into smashing gloves for the th time it had all lost its novelty
i bought it here for  in december and traded it to gamestop for  in february
as a bargin bin item it was worth it for awhile but im glad i didnt buy it when it was newfor those who know what prototype is this game is a copy of that type
the abilities can be hard to figure out especially for younger kids and the missions can be confusing or overly difficult
i also dont like being able to run around and kill police and civilians both ethically and as part of hulks storymy son has fun running jumping and smashing things for a while
the game is too boring for me to play enough to unlock things for him and they would be too complicated anyway he is  so thats about as much as we can get out of itthis game has some beatiful scenery andwell thats about it
this game commits the cardinal sin of video games its very boring
and im a huge fan of kotor so im not averse to talky talkiness but the generic story tedious combat and uninteresting statability system caused me to sell this game quicker than any game ive ever had
just bewarethis game has been highly overated and i really do not understand whyobviously from the makers of knights of the old republic which were great games comes this boring and highly uncontrollable game
it starts slow and is so slow moving the entire game through
there are no new aspects not seen in rpgs before it and nothing is original
it combines the fighting style of tenchu with the rpg style of kotr without lightsabers
you spend most of the game choosing from a variety of boring dialogues which make you good or evil having no effect on the game whatsoever
the fighting is so boring i would rather choose dialogue than use the same hit combos continuously
when you upgrade fighting styles it only makes fights worse because every enemy dies after one hit
its like playing with cheats while trying to have a challenge
buy kotr or final fantasy if you like rpg
stay away from this boring and so highly overated game
most games that go from  to  dollars within so little time obviously have problemsi was rather disappointed with this game
especially after reading all the hype about it
and it being done by bioware
it did not meet up to my standards of rpgsnot near enough options for your player from the get go
graphics arent near as good as i heard they were
when your flying around in the aircraft in this game it looks like the old astroids game
it was a real let down
especially because i bought it when it first came out
 bucks wasted
i bought the special addition of this game as well
i would hate to see the normal versionlets take a look game glass lcd screen for ps slim supports the resolution x and costs  february  mojoplay lcd screen for ps slim supports the resolution x and costs  joytech lcd screen for ps slim supports the resolution x and costs 
it also comes with a car adapater and remote control plus builtin brightness and contrast controlsi admit that i didnt try game glass only mojoplay and joytech but obviously both game glass and mojoplay simply cannot deliver any decent results at only  lines of resolution
sure the screen size is large but details are very difficult to read
i couldnt read averagesized text or see enough details on mojoplay and i expect the same to be true with game glass
after finding a very favorable magazine review of joytech i decided to try it as well and i was truly amazed with the difference
joytech quality is visibly much better and it displays all the details that mojoplay and game glass simply cannotat first i believed that both game glass and mojoplay supported only  lines of resolution due to technical reasons but now i see that this is not true and im even disappointed that such screens are being sold for gaming purposesi can now recomend joytech for use during travel and at home even as an alternative to a larger monitor
while mojoplay and game glass are sufficient only for travel and not with every gamenote that i couldnt find the joytech screen on amazoncom but it can be found on google and froogle
its also difficult to find information if joytech is designed for the regular or slim ps but indeed it is for slim psevery year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie from russia with love which is actually not a bad game
recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this i simply couldnt resist picking up scarface the world is yours
i loved the movie scar face and i was gonna love thisbut it turns out i didntthe controls are really a joke instead of your normal fpspsrpg etcetera there are really bland controls you cant even tell what to do
the dialouge is corny and everything else is a jokefor diehard fans only i guessthis game is pretty much the same as dynasty warriors  and  but without the lag
dw empires dont have lag either and is a much better game than this dynasty warriors  imoin dynasty warriors  each character goes thru about  stages then you see the ending
the stages are boring small and all look the same
the strategy of capturing bases is pathetic dw empiress design is better
to make things worse all stages are available from free mode
after awhile i got tired of playing the same stages geez all the characters share stages a big let down
there are no witches soccresses battering ram catapult fire breathing cart etc i was expecting all this and more
the stage design is truly sadoverall i dont recommend buying this game
get dw empires insteadheres another superhero game that has nice graphics but game play really sucks
first off the game is a button masher without any rhyme or reason as to which buttons execute what powers not smooth and controlled like in xmen legendsmarvel ultimate alliancejustice league heroes games
it felt like i was going to break my controller
and it seemed as though the uptake was really slow you know you press the punchattack button and there seemed to be a slight delay so you end up pressing buttons in an absolute frenzy trying to get the characters to respond quicker
very frustratingthe other problem is the games camera which likes to zoom in on irrelevant things for no reason at all
also some areas are really dark and there are small cracks that you can fall through maybe this is a bug in the game but not goodanother thing is that the box claims that you play as a team but most of the missions you are exploring either by yourself or in pairs and you dont get to choose who you want to beif you really want to play a fun game as the fantastic four get marvel utlimate alliancei understand the sequel to the fantastic four movie will be in theaters soon
if the powers that be were smart they wouldve chosen either ravensoftware or snowblind studiosmakers of xmen legendsmarvel utlitmate alliance and justice league heroes respectively to create the next game
if not they better insist that activision follow their lead ironically ravensoftware falls under the activision umbrella but i think that activision is the distributor and not the maker of the  xmenmarvel gamesperhaps this is actually marvels responsibility
they should really pay attention to customer reviews and find gaming companies that create fun and enjoyable games rather than more crap like this
by not doing so marvel is really alienating their fan baseactivisions past track record of marvel comic to film games has been quite great the past few years xmen legends spiderman  etc
which leads me to wonder what went wrong with fantastic four
the movie was well lacking to say the least but there was so much potential with the game that was wasted
playing as mr fantastic invisible woman the thing and the human torch you play in some nicely designed and somewhat destructable levels that are taken from the movie as well as some levels and bosses included here for fans of the comic series
however this is what absolutely kills fantastic four its a button mashing beat em up that doesnt offer anything new and becomes real repetitive real quickly
there are some minigames available depending on who you play as but theres not enough of them and the voice acting during the cutscenes is surprisingly bad
the graphics are decent enough and the controls wont really matter because fantastic four is a pure button masher plain and simple
coop mode is a bit fun but the ball was really dropped because there could have been some great multiplayer modes that would have spiced things up a bit
all in all this is worth a look if youre a fan of the ff or for simple and easy beat em ups but for all others this is better left on the shelf and if youre craving a really good beat em up check out the warriorsthis is a game that kids would probably enjoy
for adults its about as sad as the filmpros game is actually more interesting than the film game is best when you have to cooperate to solve a problem unfortunately there isnt enough of this kind of puzzle solving
eg
reed cant walk thru an energy barrier unless sue creates a force field around him
the interface controls for lending powers to one another is there but is never used to their greatest potential discovering new capabilities as you level up especially when you combine them with other team mates different characters have different strengths that work best in different environments
eg
when you are in a laser fight sue is great to use because her infinite shield can deflect lasers back at opponents
when you are johnny you can wildly throw fireballs with low cost to your cosmic powerscons extremely repetitive audio is very poorly done in some cases there is no audio at all graphics are pretty hideous by todays standards buggy
game crashes sometimes the combination lock puzzles are an extreme waste of time very aggrevating at the end in the final boss fight you must successfully complete an ultimate timed combo to win
i gave up after too many tries when your ai comrads are fighting they do not impart as much damage as when you take over the character
this is done no doubt so that you dont get out done by your ai partners but it really  makes them useless as partnersbought it when it came out played through it in about  hours have never put it back in my machine
translation rental
even though it was near the end of the line for the ps its graphics fell waaaaayyyy short of other competition like god of war
they seemed to mostly phone this one in like many movie tieins
id basically describe it as a lessfun double dragon with lightsabers and a broken versus modethe greatest compliment i can honestly give it is that it was entertaining to watch nongamers whack each other with lightsabers in the versus mode at a recent party
its so badly done the playing field is pretty evenyour best gaming research and effort will still leave you deadeven with a zombie pressing buttons beside youif we think way way way back and we think really really really hard its still impossible to come up with a single good game lucasarts came out with
and of course this one is no exceptionlets begin with the fact that this game is horrible
its a button mashers dream so it does not take any skill to complete
its repeditive triangle square r triangle circle and any other button that does anything
this is one of those games that the only way to do anything cool or entertaining is to memorize a long list of special movesfighting jedis in this game was a nightmare
it was simple and boring
to begin with took about fifty hits to kill the other jedi
hmmmm
and on top of that you could basically hold down the block button and not get hit unless the other jedi did a special move oooooo and knocked you downrevenge of the sith is a linear and one deminsional game
not fun
stay awayi am not a hard core gamer
by that i mean that i just cant play a game for more than an hour at a time
over the weekend my friend who is a star wars fanatic but also a casual gamer saw the movie and for the heck of it after the movie we rented this game just to see what it was likewe played the game for less than  hours
as i noted we normally are not marathon gamers but the desire to finish a game we rented usually a daunting task took us over
we played  hours one night and  the next and finished it
the final battle obviously one that is supposed to be the most difficult took maybe  attempts or a total of about  minutes at normal difficulty
that was disappointingthe game itself has acceptable graphics but nothing spectacular
in regards to gameplay the force powers are fun to use and its easy to remember which button or trigger controls which but this really is nothing more than a button mashing combo game which sort of incorporates the experience aspect of lotr games in that the better the combo the higher the experience rankinghowever the game does not have the ea polish that the lotr games had and as noted is too short and too easy to be worth a purchase price of 
so as the title of this review says rent but dont buy you will feel cheatedthe good thing about this game is its good graphics
the bad things about this game are as follows the game is too short the coop have limited levels only  its all a side scrolling game and its not as immersive as true d third person games  the gameplay too simpleeasy the game is overpriced for a game you can beat in  or  days  you only get  force powers per player
this game might be better suited for much younger playersnovice  players  or players who like a very simple  easy game experience
i wish they couldve made this game into a true d third person game in the same fashion as jade empire
my biggest complaint is the old school sidescrolling gameplay its outdated technologya true d style game is much more immersive  exciting
in this game you spend too much time wondering whats in frontto the sideor behind you because your sight is limited in side scrolling
this game feels like an upolished rushed into production game
i imagined a game like kotor mixed with the lightsaber fighting in the style of jade empirethis is another joke of a gaming system by sony
they are even advertising its other features videos and music over the games
now im not a ds fanboy
i also think that is a waste of money
the best handheld gaming system is the gbasp hands down
buy that instead
its status as  wont be taken any time sooni just sold my yearold psp
i consider myself a pretty hardcore gamer but the psp just wasnt cutting it for me
theres some good software out there for it but for the most part its just not practical as a portable gaming machine
sure the screen is gorgeous although the pixels die quickly but aside from messing with the firmware and playing a game here and there it just doesnt last as a game machinepros great graphics in most cases on a very pretty screen lots of watered down umd movies to select from if dvds arent your thing or you have money ot burn a few really good games particularly golf and puzzle games and dont forget gta hackable and crackable run emulators of old games against the warranty
warning
cons lots of bad software and with thirdparty support slowly dropping due to poor hardware sales and high production costs the future is not looking so bright
theres no killer app yet and most games are just stripped down or modified ports of ps games the second p in psp is a bit of an overstatement the psp is way too large and fragile for most situations many games suffer from a lack of portability as a result of their design very poor battery life and wifi support is obviously not very portable slow load speeds and disc access noisy disc drive and a very expensive storage medium in seven months three pixels had died and turned permanently black cost of hardware and games not just for consumers but for game developersmy honest advise is to try a few games and consider the pros and cons before making your purchase
if youre looking for portable gaming general consensus says nothing beats the gameboy advancei however am hopelessly addicted to mario kart dsi really wanted to give this system a fair shot
i truely did however after trying to get into game after game i just cant get addicted to any one
the psp been collecting dust
im not saying dont buy it but im rather saying that you may want to see if the game selection is to your liking before putting down money for thisif youre going to buy it just for the multimedia features give it more thoughtin my opinion they are overrated unless you have a huge memory stick
also whos going to put down  bucks for a movie that doesnt have half as many features as normal dvds
theres an adapter to connect the psp to the tv but thats another  dollarsedit after a while i bought a larger gb memory stick and some dvd converting software
i am beginning to see the video capabilities on this and i wish i could bump the rating higher
also i bought some good gamestiger woods pga tour  and syphon filter dark mirrorthis morning i went to pick up the sony psp which i had reservedthe price came out higher then i thought the memory card for this thing cost x more then the ps memory cardi told the saleperson i wanted to preview this before i drop that much cash on something like thisneedless to say i spent about min
playing the demo pspthe botom line the graphics are not ps graphics they are d yes but its more along the line off the psone and sega dreamcastthe framerate is prety goodbeing able to play films on it is without a doubt a huge gimmick along with being able to use it as a ipod type deviceanother prob
with this thing its too big it feels odd in your hands the anolog stick sucksi walked out the door minus the psp i think im banded from that particular store because i didnt buy itsony seems to have forgoten where they have come from and will marget and sell any product just to get the consumers well earned cash this product is proofheres a few factors you should really think about before you buy this handheld devicein about a year the next gen consoles will be out why pay that much cash for a glorfied psonepstwo handheld
for the price to pick one of these things up you could buy all three next gen consoles xboxps game cube buy the looks of the launch titles they all seem to be ports from the ps
the price should be a huge factor in buying something that cost this much
its really not sexy sony is marketing this thing like if you own one of these youll get supermodels and be so cool the realality is walk around a busy city with this and youll eather get laughed at or mugged for the stupid thing
without a doubt just a status symbolanyone thinking about buying this should keep some of this in mind before spending that much cointhe psp is a wonderful piece of hardware but its just not ready yet and sony knows it
ive always been taught never to buy a new piece of technology as soon as it comes out and nowhere is that more true than for the pspthe dead pixels issue is probably the biggest annoyance so far
sometimes these are small and sometimes theyre pretty big and detract from the overall gaming experience
and to the reviewer who said that its not a big dealare you kidding me
i dont know about you but when i fork over  dollars of my hard earned money the hardware damn well better work like its supposed to
would you buy a plasma tv if it had multiple defects
or an article of clothing that was stained in multiple places
i doubt it
sony is recommending that you wait  weeks to see if the problem clears up and then theyll see what they can do to fix it
gee thats nice of you sony
sell someone a faulty product and then tell them too bad so sad
wonderful marketing tacticsthe battery life is an even worse issue
if you play a graphic intensive game like ridge racer under ideal conditions you can get  hours of battery life
keep in mind this is at low volume with almost everything disabled
no wifi low sound etc
tests run by game sites confirm that with these enabled the battery life is sometimes at a pathetic  and a half hours
this is unacceptable
i know that the psp is a very powerful piece of technology and that these games require a lot of battery power but cmon sony
i know you could have done betterfolks please use your wits and wait a while
anyone can tell that this product is still in the experimental stages
sonys ceo even admitted that later generations of the psp will have a better battery better graphics and better construction
he even said they are working on a new battery which will work for  hours
thats definitely much better than  i want a psp too but im not foolish enough to get one and be sonys beta testeri see a lot of kids writing about the psp
im not a kid ive been playing video games for over  years
ive owned almost every system that has come out and been happy with most of them
i was as excited as most peolple that sony was making a handheld
i own a nintendo ds and like most people say its games are mainly aimed at kids
i bought one for the franchise games ive been playing most of my lifei went out the week the psp came out and bought one
i got home and my wife wanted to see what everyone was talking about
i opened it and started it up and guess what dead pixels
i took it back and got another one
same thing with the nd and third and fourth
every one of the four systems i got had dead pixels
thats not a very good ratio
the graphics were awesome the line up of games coming out is awesome but the fact that i had four systems with the same problem it just isnt worth my timei own a psand a gamecube i love both of them but when it comes to quality nintendo has never let me down
ive never taken back a nintendo system because of a defect
i love sonys other  systems and will continue buying their home consoles but i think that they rushed out the psp to beat out nintendos new gameboy but nintendos taking the time to make sure every problem is worked out before they release itone last note to eveybody who thinks the ds was put out to compete with psp it wasnt
nitendos got a new gameboy coming out to compete with the psp the ds was put out to give gamers another way of playing games
innovation is what the ds is about not graphics or mps or movies
just pure funi love my playstation  but this psp sucks
the only thing i like was the graphics but i dont care to much about that if i did i would support the xbox
stick to the nintendo ds
atleast you get quality games at a reasonable price
 dollars a pop come on ill rather spend that on the new god of war game
basically its not worth it unless you dont have nothing else to spend you money on
what i have heard there are great games out there for the consoles
what a waste of  dollarsso what if it can play songs
it only has six hours of battery life
dont you have an ipod mp player or cd player
use that
it plays movies too
use a dvd player maybe a portable one not this three inch screen  hours for movies
i will give it one thing it has impressive graphics
but would you rather have a handheld that invests in the innovation of gaming or giving its own handheld a few features that most of us already have such as dvd players or music players
i am not saying that it is not a good machine i am just saying that you shouldnt spend extra money for something most of us already have
i you like sony i suggest you wait for the  nextgeneration of its handhelds
the games are goodwell its a year later and the psp still hasnt really taken off
unless theres some major changes i could never recommend anyone buy this and its centered around two major issues that still havent been addressed cost and game librarythe psps expensive  really  really  expensive
youll need between twohundred the core pack to two hundred fifty dollars the value pack for the psp itself
id recommend the core system
the only substantial difference between the two bundles is the value pack comes with a  mb memory card
anyone who downloads mps will already know a  mb card is small to the point of being virtually worthless
a decent capacity memory card is a musthave
dont make the mistake of cheaping out and buying a small one do it once and do it right
all those mps pictures and gamesaves add up fast and having them all saved across several smaller cards is a pain not to mention easy to lose
give yourself about a hundred bucks and get a big one
im thinking  gig kinda big
to pick up a newer game and a movie youre going to have to punkdown another seventy to a hundred dollarsthis is the point where i just talked myself out of the sale
im pushing about three hundred seventy dollars and thats on the conservative side
i can get an xbox  for that kind of money
i can get an awesome ipod for a hundred dollars less and have potentially  gigs of spaceits a year later and the game selection outside of maybe a halfdozen really great games is awfully average
the umd movie feature is nice but the movies seem to average about ten dollars more in cost then their dvd counterparts with half of the content its usually just the feature no extrasas powerful as the system is and as cool as it could be its just too expensive
knock the price down a hundred bucks and it immediately becomes a much better buy
at threehundred fifty dollars minimum though its just too much to ask its a new device its neat but not quite as nice as i was expectingi never played a ps but if this is what ps graphics look like i will stick with my xboxmovies look great on this thing but honestly the games i played dont look that great lots of pixelizationmaybe i am expecting too much i dont know the wow factor just is not therecontrary to what he may have stated a psp cannot hold more music than an ipodunless you buy anywhere from   gb memory cardsjust a single  gb card costs about whereas an ipod price ranges from   
so you do the math
dont let someone else do it for youif you plan on purchasing a psp for music and photos  dont
get a  or  gb ipod photoi have seen a ds in action as well as a pspyou wont hear from me that one is better than the otherbuy the one that you like or wantmake you own decisions americaup to  for one psp game
be careful what people saythe graphics in a psp are comparable to a ps not equal or necessarily betterof course it will vary from game to gamei dont mention the ds game prices because i imagine that they remain around the  range not to mention that it is a less powerful system than the pspoh the humanity of the loading times
this is not the type of system any concious gamer would ever want to use for the purpose of gaming
apparently someone never told sony that games can frustrate people especially games that mercilously exploit the concept that at times there is nothing the gamer can do but sit and watch everything he worked for turn to dung right in front of him
you can imagine my horror when i started playing games on this  dollar portable machine
the games are unknowingly placed into a system that cranks and groans with each agonizing attempt to retrieve the stupid amount of code sony expects a system of this calibur to produceimagine working for fort knox and having them tell you that by hand they are expecting you to move every brick of gold to a facitlity just two feet away
imagine this system cranking and groaning and crying out for the sweet release of death as it attempts to load these obscenely detailed gamesholding this little system in front of you trying to negotiate with games that had their immense amount of options crammed into the use of six stupid buttons losing touch with the initial admiration of its apparent abilities when you realize that this thing is just not fun to play you realize that sony has a some sort of grudge against gamersbuy this system so you can pay almost  for a  gig memory stick and copy movies on to it you would have probably been alright being able to view on your computer at home anyway
as a media player its alrightthe games and movies are little discs trapped within bulky cases to keep them from getting scratched
the downside to this is you cant just put ten of these things into a compact flipbook
you can only therefore bring about two discs with you wherever you go or defeat the purpose of having something compact in the first placeif you want a great portable gaming experience buy the nintendo ds nintendo realized that loading times sucked a long time ago the games for the ds are more often designed with fun in mind instead of great graphics that take an amount of time to load that makes you forget ever wanting to admire the game in the first place nintendos games are compactif you want a great portable media player there are much better alternatives out there
portable media players with hard drives that amount to  gig
portable media players with that kind of hard drive capacity and are around  bucks
when you compare that to how many memory sticks youd have to buy to amount to the hard drive space you do the mathinitially i can understand why people admire this little system and how its graphics are just better than other portable systems
the ideas surrounding buying one however should be fun with the games and a good reason to invest in media designed just for itthe games
any kind of fun one may have playing the games is sucked away by the obscene loading times and constant grinding of the system as it attempts to compensate for the speed of the average gamer
i have not played a single game on the psp that didnt have obscene loading times and that didnt make me want to trash the  piece of dungthe media
the movies are smaller yet less compact than dvds twice their size
the movies never have as many options due to the tiny disc of information trapped in the bulky prison of hard plastic
any type of movies you may download must be played on a memory stick that at its cheapest is around  for a  megabyte stick
what are you going to watch thats only  megabytesthis system is going to go down when people realize that a portable dvd player a nintendo ds and an ipod are much less frustrating alternatives to this little piece of dung system that tries too hard to fit inthe psp reminds me of the itunes software  jack of all trades master of none
which means it does a lot of things but doesnt do any of them particularly well
itunes is a pretty decent allinone media player for joe sixpack but it lacks many features found in standalone apps
similarly you can buy a psp and save some money by not purchasing dedicated devices to do many of the things the psp does but youre also not going to get the same level of functionality
for example gamingbetween this and the nintendo ds the psp has better graphics and a brighter screen
its just too bad theres only like  decent games made for it
im sorry but the ds mops the floor with the psp when it comes to actual gameplay
most of what is out for the psp isnt really any different than what most of us have been playing for the past  years
not to mention that the umd discs are bulky to carry around games on the psp take forever to load and suck the life out of the battery like a hoovermusicok i gotta ask  how many of you dont have an mp player already
my iaudio flash player has more features than the psp especially for audiobooks is about the size of a zippo lighter and the batteries on it last at least x longer than the psp
not only that but you can get a gb player iaudio g for just a little bit more than a gb memory stick and also doubles as a voice recorderemulationhomebrewmoviesif these are your main areas of interest do a web search for a portable system called the gpx
this system does everything the psp does minus the commercial games and wireless support plus more
it runs linux and is a completely open platform which means there are already tuns of emulators and homebrew stuff out for it much more so than the psp and you dont have to worry about the parent company forcing firmware upgrades down your throat in order to keep you from doing what you want to with the hardware you bought and paid for
no more having to downgrade the firmware whenever you wanna throw down with some smb on your favorite nes emulator
not only that but it accepts standard sd cards as opposed to sonys proprietary memory sticks will play videos without having to go through a conversion process meaning you dont have to go out and buy movies again in the umd format that you already own and even has a tv out feature
oh it also plays mps has support for photos and all that jazzin the end its hard to recommend this device unless you just havent gotten sick of playing gta already and want to play it on the gotwisted metal is one of my more favorite franchises in all of my years of gaming but this game doesnt really keep up with what im used toits higher grade of cartoony artwork is really flattering at first but it quickly becomes annoyingthe characters arent very fun and some seem to topple over others easilytower tooth is nearly impossible to face on your own i used the fastest character and tower tooth would still be able to run me overin short this is probably one of the least wellmade games of the twisted metal franchise but its good for its  minutes of funif you want one of my opinion better twisted metal games you would find more luck with twisted metal black or twisted metal twisted metal headon  going left to right was not happening with me
maybe im missing something but trying to turn and move around was a bit clumsy
so clumsy that i lost interest in the game really fasthorrible controls
all u do in this game is drive around in a truck with a clown on it and shoot people that is it
nothin else when u try to shoot someone u can never get a direct hit
when u try  turn u go fast and out of control dont get this game get either ridge racer or need for speed underground rivalsi was not happy with this keyboard for one reasonreflective paint on the keys
if the keyboard was used in a completely dark room it would work great but the light from my monitor reflects off of the keys resulting in a very low contrast between the keys and the illuminated letters on the keys
the tops of the keys should have been painted with a matte nonreflective black so that the blue light shining through the letters would be more in contrast
in real life use the visual ergonomics are very poori think this keyboard is a great concept but it was poorly realized
the light from a monitor reflects off of the keys creating almost a silver look which is very low contrast to the illumination colori also purchased a small zippy illuminated keyboard which is much easier to read
however the zippy is only slightly larger than a laptop keyboard and i wanted a full size so i ordered the eclipsei like the feel of this keyboard even though the tilt needs to be higher
trouble is the backlighting shines up through the keys in such a way that its very hard to see especially at the lower angle
im sure this would be fine if you were a touch typist but since im not its a waste of money for me
if you just want it to look cool this might be for you
if you really need to see the keys in low light look elsewherei love baseball and usually mvp gets my nod every year for being fun and exciting
but this portable version trying to take after its bigger cousin falls flat on its face and ea sports should no better than to release this  arsed effortso whats wrong
how about the choppy graphics after the first pitch
how about the batting game being boring
it makes hitting an extremely simple process against the computer
the computer pitchers usually pitch about  strikes for every four pitches so your guaranteed a hit every time
i hit five home runs in a row for three games straight and the challenge was just not there
i just felt an overall lack of any fun it was just a batting farce not a true baseball simso they simply slapped the mvp name on the box and knew it would sell and that is being nice
the game looks pretty bad for a psp game
the player models look good but the in game action is no where near the quality of mlb baseball
the load times as mentioned by some are very long and unforgiving and the gameplay seems choppy when the ball hits the field
there is no franchise which is unforgiving and the gameplay is lathargic at best
the game itself looks like an old playstation title on the psone which is unacceptable because many of the sports titles like nba street and nfl street look  times better than this
like i said defintely feels like a rush job ea
can do much better
i did like the sound effects and commentary but the crowd noise is repetitive it sounds like the fans were recorded at  second intervals and played over and over
even crazier the game froze up on me twice
really
bottomline wait for something else or give mlb for psp a try
mvp baseball is anything but the mvp this year its back to the minors for eai chose this rating because there are certain aspects about it that can be annoying at times
the way the text operates is the worst of it
every letter has an annoying sound effect beep so youre listening to a constant beeping sound almost the entire game
i like the anime style and the connection to norse myth i believe
also the grim angel has a baditude and an ultimate attack that is pretty freakin awesomethis game is really disappointing
why
because the controls are too darn twitchy way too sensitive
move the analog stick a little to the left or right by a little i mean maybe th to the extreme left or right and the game behaves almost as if youre are turning to the extreme left or right lock to lockwant proof
go to the major video gaming websites gamespot and ign and watch the videos they have for need for speed underground rivals
the vast majority of videos show cars crashing into walls left and right
and keep in mind these cars are most likely being controlled by video game writers
in other words not even these veteran video game players video game writers could control these cars wellmy other complaints with this gamethe drift races just plain sck
with the games twitchy controls doing drift races past the first  or  is very very frustratingthe upgrade system is very unorganized
when a player upgrades a part theres nothing telling the player how the upgrade will affect the cars performance
its a crapshootthis game just isnt as fun as other psp racers namcos ridge racer in particular
this game just isnt fast enough
after winning a few races the game gives you the option of doing a quick race in a souped up maxed out car
in other words you can do  race in a fully speced out car for a quick race  its supposed to give you an idea of what the player can eventually reach
but these races are mundane compared to the later races in ridge racer
compared to ridge racer this game feels like driving in grandpas car and ridge racer controls a lot bettermy recommendation get ridge racer a very very good game or wait for midnight club  dub edition to come out at the end of june   ridge racer is alot more fun than nfsur and midnight club  should be better than nfs i have faith in rockstarso need for speed does not get my recommendation
you should pass on this one im selling my copy to some scker on ebayneed for speed underground rivals  fame or shame
lets c the pros and consthe prosgood graphicsnice musicthe cons  bucksyou get bored of it after a couple of daysreally the same thing as the origanal nfs undergroundwhen u go rele fast the car gets all skipyso as u can c this game gets a shame
the cons show it to u 
dont waste your time on this game go get atv offroad fury blazin trailsa lot of elements in the gameplay are very similar to vice city but then again a vice city had a few relations to the original scarface movie
differs from vice city in how much more vulgar it is bad language and drug usenot the greatest of gamesthis game is based on the popular tv show law  order  criminal intent
you take on the role of detective robert goren tracking down criminals and bringing them to justicei love this tv series and i also have enjoyed previous law  order games
i thought this would be a perfect match for me and my interests and in fact i made plans to do a full walkthrough for the gameif i hadnt made those plans i wouldnt have lasted more than  minutes in this game
as it is i still havent finished my walkthrough because the game is so incredibly frustrating
im playing the game on a very robust system that i have played hundreds of other games on to write up reviews
it is most definitely not a machine issue here  it is a game issuethe premise is that you are in essence doing the things in the tv series
this means there is no courthouse scenes like in law  order the original
in criminal intent the show is all about understanding the criminal mind figuring out what happened and getting them to confessfirst character movement is awful
your character gets stuck on doors stuck on walls stuck on other people and just stands there twitching like a madman
you have to keep moving around until you can get him in the exact right spot to interact with the object you wish
sometimes hell randomly throw his arms straight out in a i can fly
movementthe game crashes
often
save every  minutes if you dont want to lose your datathe map menu buttons sometimes become disabled
you lose the ability to scroll up or down
this gets you stuck on half the map area for a while
in addition theres a strange diagonalarrow button on the map that when you press it reveals hidden areas that you shouldnt know about yet
since there is no warning that this is some sort of a cheat it affects your gameplaytheres a new interrogation mode where instead of choosing specific things to ask you instead choose a style of speaking  for example you can be straightforward or empathtic or flattering or so on
this is nice in theory
in practice it is awful
there are times that you choose empathetic and the character says something really cruel
you just watch it like a train wreck with your mouth wide open
at least if you screw up all you have to do is walk away for a few minutes and then return again
the person seems to have completely forgotten how much you upset them
also there are times that asking a question makes the person respond in a way that makes no sense
the game sort of expects you to use a certain order and if you happen to choose a different order the game doesnt account for it
for example in one situation you ask a question in one way and the person lies
so then you press them on the question saying why did you lie
if you choose to just press them in the first place you still say why did you lie
even though the person didnt lie at allcertainly there were good intentions here
the graphics are reasonably good
the gameplay theory is good
however whoever was assigned to program this had serious problems  and the quality control is pretty much completely missing
this is a game that could have used another  months in development to work out all of these quite serious issueswhile at first its way too cool seeing the guard beat up the inmates with their nightstick it happens a thousand times over and the animations stay the same after the inmates on the ground they suddenly appear on their feet again and go on about their buisness
not only that keeping maximum and high security inmates away from medium and low security inmates is a joke
you try to build a fence to keep the high security away from low security then when each day you take in two more they all enter in the same place the low security yard then you have to search every stinking inmate until you find the one and assign him to a cell and drag him into the area for high security
its overall bullcrap in my opinion because if you put the fence up to keep the other inmates out then new inmates cant get in plus your lucky if the fences actually work building them is a complete joke as they arenet made to connect together and inmates can just waltz right through them
not to mention the poor controls and crappy graphics
its horrible for a game
even if you enjoy it the first hour or two of playing the third and fourth hours will burn you out fast leaving to sheer boredom and an epiphany of how much money you wasted
and time for that matter waiting on the game you thought would be funs arrival
i say the tycoon series should stick with the same boring rollercoaster and zoo themes because honestly there is no shanks or shivs on here and all you see is a few guys throwing punches and thats thatway too short way too unfun way too unoriginaldo not buy it this is by far the worst game on the ds it wasnt even to me worth the rent at alli never could get in to this game
i think the top down view just didnt seem right to me
plus the graphics arent all that great
this game basically fell into the large pit of boring psp games that everyone complains about
i cant think of any redeeming qualities that this games possesses
its just boringits an okay start on the psp for rpgs but its very boring fast
you constantly do the same thing which is
to go to some underground place and kill the boss
thats all you do the entire game
this game is like its unfinished
it needs more to it not just constantly killing stupid bosses
the  characters you can choose from arent any greater then the rest of themwhat you have here is a great portable system and a great game franciseso why is it that when they made a metel gear game for the psp they didnt make a mg game with classic gameplaywhich would have been a hitbut take a card based formulai dont see the ds coming out with a mario game with card based gameplayi dont hate the gameim just saying it could have been something muchmuchbetterthis is a review from someone who had never played a card game so if you are a  munch card game fan you dont need to read this
i have played just about every incarnation of metal gear from the first nes game to the gb versions
after mgs i had lost a little faith in the series but mgs brought me right back into the fold
so i bought acid for my psp even though i had never played a card game before
what can i say
the story seemed fine
the visuals were fresh
even the music sounded really cool
so why did i pretty much give up on it after several hours of playing it
it just wasnt enjoyable
if you have never played a card game before and are wondering what this game is like try imagining this
you have to walk across the room you are in and open a door
sounds pretty simple right
ok now imagine that you can only move a few footsteps at a time
this is slowed down by the fact that everyone else in the room cant move while you are moving and vice versa and they are all moving a few footsteps at a time too
now then every time you move you have to pick the direction you want to go in and the direction you want to face when you stop moving
alright let me sum this up for you
you finally get to the other end of the room after about  minutes granted you are not spotted have fallen asleep while playing or were hiding for prolonged periods of time
maybe there are people out there who think this type of slowed down painfully planned out locomotion is invigorating but not me
i am a get things done kind of guy
i dont need  hours to strategize on how to how to move from point a to point b  my cerebellum takes care of redundant movements for me so i dont have to worry about it
it was frustrating because you constantly know what you need to do but there was no way to get around the fact that it was going to take forever to do it
wait for a real mg adventure or get splinter cell planned for the pspi like the concept of this game
i really do
you make tactical moves using cards from your deck
over the course of the game you will obtain new and more powerful cards and can build your own deck to suit your needs
the problem is the game does a terrible job of explaining how it all works
it will throw you helpful tips in between missions but itll usually tell you something very vital many mission after you needed it
at first i thought this game was really cool when i started it but it soon became too frustrating
the low point for me was when i snuck up right behind an unsuspecting soldier emptied two clips of an ak into him and he still did not die
i understand that def and body armor can play a huge role in these games but that is just ridiculous
it seems almost impossible to stay stealthy in this game which is what metal gear is all about
you pretty much have to use massive amounts of explosives to be able to kill things off and that will always alert everyone to your presence
maybe im just not getting it
either way the game sure hasnt helped me figure out what im doing wrong and im definitely not sticking around any longer to figure it outdeath jr was the first psp game ever unveiled and its been in development for quite a long time
ever since it was announced gamers have been enticed by a graphic design that is similar to tim burtons style
unfortunately you cant judge a book by its coverdeath jr is cute and despite a long development time the final product is strangely halfassed and doesnt quite hit the markthe story isnt much of a bloodpumper
death jr and his friends go to a museum during a class field trip and dj tries to show off by opening up a mysterious treasure chest
as a result the evil necromancer moloch is released and begins to wreak havoc on the museum in the process sealing djs friends in different worlds
the gameplay forces you to enter these worlds fight through them and find the missing pieces that make up djs friendsthe gameplay wouldnt be quite so bad if it werent for a scatterbrain camera that results in difficult controls
the game is like a bastard child of devil may cry and rachet  clank
dj attacks with a big scythe as well as nine different guns including dual pistols a rocket launcher an electric gun and hamsters attached to c explosives
there is a combo system that earns points as you rack up kills and destructive force around the level and like devil may cry a bonus is given to players who get high scores on each levelunfortunately playing through death jr just isnt that much fun
by the th stage or so i was nearly snoring through hit combos
i found myself wanting each stage to end more and more quickly as the game progressed
each stage brought something new to the table but overall nothing impressed me as much as i had hopedi dont mean to sound so negativedeath jr definitely had a chance though
the developers had ages to make it into a wellcrafted platformer on the psp and they just didnt get the job done as well as they should have
hopefully a sequel comes along and proves that death jr and his friends are worth paying attention toits a little too hard and whats worse is that you cant save your progress during levels
you get  continues and you need to pass the whole level from start to finish with those  or its game over and you start the level from the begining
of course this gets frustrating
the biggest fault in the gameplay is the camera
sometimes you need to be messing with the camera to get the right angle so you can jump onto a platform without falling into lava but its impossible to get a good camera view
using your grim reaper knife to jump from hook to hook is also a nightmarethe best way i found to attack most levels was to move foward slowly and shoot at enemies from a far
overall its not a bad game and some could actually find it more challanging than frustrating
nothing like the thrill of old days when you came down to your final life and you had to come through or all your work was for nothing
i recommend you try it but it could of been betterthis will be a quick review
look the game fairly represents soccer here
this game is probably a  on a scale of one to ten
it does this by making the game feel kind of like it is
the problem is in america we do not have an appreciation for the subtle differences between an average play and a truly great player
we do not know this because we are not fanatical about soccer
if we were we could tell the difference
the same problem exists in this game
i am a self professed nonlover of the game
i dont hate it but i dont love it
because of this i could not tell you if this game did a great job of representing the game
it is extremely accurate at representing it the way i know the game
it represents it as a moderately exciting sport played on to big of a field for fast actionbottom line is it fun
a little more fun than watching a slow paced soccer game
at least you get to control the slow pace of the game here
will i keep this game
ebay to the rescue
will soccer fans like this game
they will adore this game
is it for kids
if you want them to be boredwhile this game is lots of fun youll find some almostunacceptable gameplay lagswhen you take a shot on goal if you score no lag
if it ends up deing deflected or shot out of bounds which happens more than scoring of course theres about a second lag while the game processes the outofbounds
also when pausing theres about a  second lag before the pause screen appears
sometimes gasp you have to press it twice to get the pause
like i said the game is enjoyable and i play it a lot but these little lags make you feel like youre playing something that was rushed out of the door to make the psp launchive heard the newer fifa  for psp fixes these little annoyances but thats not firsthand knowledgeim excited at the prospect of playing football ok soccer on my psp so getting fifa soccer is just a matter of time considering it seems to be the bestlooking footballing game on the console so far
sadly my trust was misplaced and i was left to stare at a piece of junk that i just paid  bucks forive been playing fifa games for about  years
while im getting increasingly disappointed with the gameplay of this franchise at least it added some new technology namely the firsttouch to its latest fifa  for the ps xbox
while im still not fully convinced the firsttouch did improve my opinion of ea sports and im much more forgiving to the game despite already being converted to a winning eleven pro evolution soccer junkieso what can we expect from the psp version of the fifa game
a lot of disappointment really
while the firsttouch function is still in place the limitation of the psp console means that you cant execute it with the right analog stick  the psp doesnt have it
so you ended up with having to control the movement of your players with the left analog stick with your left hand and applying firsttouch and freestyle play with your left hand as well
while its not entirely humanly impossible it does take away the spontaneity of the control
not to mention the controls are less than responsive on this game making it a pain when you try to wrestle out of a tight situation while under heavy defendingthe graphics are also a dead duck on this game
granted we see mostly accurate representation of the players and clubs the fact that this game plays on a psp screen means that during the game your players are so small you can hardly see them as humans
my wife said it looks like controlling ants
i thought shes quite right
even when i turn to my favorite action and broadcast cams which supposedly allow better zoom on the screen i can still hardly make out whos who on the pitch
thats bad
of course theres always the flashy replays which detail fully how bad the graphics are with all the jagged edges and allthe audios are equally bad and im not just talking about the uninspired soundtrack here
the ingame commentary team of john motson and ally mccoist try to provide some action description but it end up all flat because weve been listening to the same old crap for years
fifa s commentary is almost an exact replica of fifa  and fifa soccers commentary is almost an exact replica of fifa  cant they get someone else to do the job to at least instill some freshness
of course theres always the incorrect descriptions
a team on the top of the table could be described as struggling and a striker who scored a hattrick could be immediately slated as missing a lot of chances when he missed two of them in the game
hey he did score three you knowhow about the overzealous referees whistles and crowdcheering
the crowd can go wow
suddenly when youre basically just clearing a ball into touch and the referees whistle is always blown when the ball the goes out of play
notice i said when
where on earth in a football game will you find such a vigilant referee
you blow the whistle after the ball goes out of play not when its still in the process of travelling past the line
and did i mention about the frequent drop in frame rates
the screen always freezes when the ball goes out after you miss a shot always
and it also freezes frequently when your players are celebrating a goal
for a  bucks game ive to ask whythe only saving grace is the inclusion of the challenge mode which requires you to stage reallife comeback or complete a rout that happened in past footballing games
at least it makes you want to try and complete all of them
you also earn points to unlock stuff like kits balls and staidums
i wont go into detail of all these because ive simply lost interest in the game after playing a few friendlies with all the problems i mentioned above
my suggestion is that you wait for fifa  if youre a fan for the ps xbox rather than spend money on thischarged psp for six months and then stopped working completly i think the cord going to the psp frayed or somethingthis battery worked great the first time i used it
however it cannot hold a charge
i learned this after charging it up for another round of uses and it wont stay on for longi bought this pouch from a thirf party seller on amazon who charged me only  including shipping
i thought that i might have got a good deal for my 
was i suprised when i got thisthis is only a glove something that should only cost 
i am suprised that amazon is selling this for 
it is a decent product it covers the psp well but it doesnt enclose it with a zipper or anything sadlyi actually sent this back to amazon  its just not what i wanted
i already have a really good case and you can get different color wrist straps right here on amazon for cheap you battle warrior after warrior
dont you think that is boring
well it certainly is
i have this game and the first level i played was fun then the game becomes ssssoooooo boring
after the fifth level i cant beat these stupid warriors and i was endanger of throwing my psp on the floor
terrible terrible game
also the warriors look like monkeys in a colorful spacesuit
i suggest you buy some other gamedynasty warriors never seems to get old
the ever popular hack and slash by koei is now on the psp ready for you to take on the go anywhere you please
the diehard dynasty warriors fan will love this
on the other hand though its really not that different from the dynasty warriors games on the ps and thats either a good thing or a bad thingthe storyline hasnt changed much at all
the land of china is split between three dynasties that want to take over the land
the land of shu wu and wei
all three used to be an alliance called the han dynasty but that eventually collapsed
now all warriors have joined the ranks of other dynasties based on what they believe in
put simple your goal is to conquer and take over as much land as you canas i said gameplay hasnt changed much in dynasty warriors but it has been tweaked here just a little bit
it isnt really for the better either but it makes the game at least seem less repetative
you start by selecting the general youd like to be
alongside this you can select other generals who have unique abilities to assist you in battle
the abilities vary depending on which sub generals you choose
the fun is experimenting to see what you come up with
some increase health some garner special abilitieswhere the game is really tweaked is the hack and slash action
the game is set up almost like a tactical rpg
youll start in one area select it go in and vanquish all your enemies
this is the hack and slash that seems to have been around since dynasty warrirors  and hasnt really been tweaked with too much since dynasty warriors   its no different here
once youve done away with the enemies in one area the path branches onward and youre allowed to choose which path youd like to take
it doesnt matter which path youll always get where you need to in the end
youll still have to select another location on the field to go to though
the location you choose to go to has its own objectives
some you may just have to defend a supply depot or take over one whatever
what it boils down to is this theres no real strategy needed
just go in there and hack and slash until everything is dead
after a while this becomes tired and boring especially since weve been doing it for the past six years or so and it really hasnt changed at allthe game also suffers from load times
each section of a mission will only take you a couple of minutes
the game has to load each time you leave and make your way to another one
as with a lot of psp games the load times in dynasty warriors are not goodthe tweaks in the gameplay dont really make the game any better either
its great that you can save whenever you want but it just gets boring really fast
the series is truly declininggraphic wise this game isnt so bad
it looks identical to dynasty warriors  on the ps
the music also seems to be taken straight from the dynasty warriors games on the ps
which means the audio isnt particularly good
put simple the game plays and sounds like dynasty warriors   it actually might be easier just to go out and get that one
it isnt nearly as detailed but for the most part the character details and vocals are ripped directly from that gamein all essence if youve got any of the ps counterparts from dynasty warriors  and up and especially if youve got dynasty warriors  theres really no need to invest in this game
it plays much slower and when it does play its no different than the last games
characters have the same moves same musous same combos nothing has changed
if you dont have any dynasty warriors game whatsoever then pick this up
otherwise its not really worth the time or the moneythis purchase disappointed me because amazon did not tell me that it was only compatible with the psp  edition and is pretty useless for the psp  editionthis is simply a cheap game
the developers didnt work very hard on it
has literally zero replay value and is not that much fun the first time you play through either
the soundtrack is all slipknot and screamo music which sucks if you dont like that type of music
there are only  guns in the game and the maps look so similar that you cant even tell them apartdo yourself a favor and dont get this game
not worth it at allthe animation of this firstperson shooter is simply laughable
its very crude
the graphics sucks too as you can barely see details on your enemies and you can barely make out your own shape
the control system is okay but the sound effect quite annoying
the gameplay is rather repetitive
its no resident evil thats for sure
i think this game sucks and is a waste of moneyintroductionthe sony psp is the gadget that does itit holds songsphotosvideosgame datas but the problem is the memory card of the pspwhen you buy a psp you already have a memory card but its probably this one the mbit works well and all but there are problems with it it doesnt hold many thingsthe mb is the cheapest memory card for psp because of one simple reasonit doesnt have enough memory to hold what i wanti could only place  songs on itthe songs are about  each plus a  minutes long songi putted a wallpaper and a picturedigital pictures takes more memory than other picturesi think its better to buy a big one than buy tons of thisbuy mggb but not this cheap mgbut when you buy a pspi dont for every pack but some doesyou have this card with ityou will be disapointed sonner or lateri gave  stars for fun because its great to download thing on i and all but  stars overall because of the short memorywell its kinda disapointing but i had no problem downloading stuff on it but if it wasnt for the very short memory then i would like iti dont recomend it i would recomend the mg or the gb that way you will have more spaceof course you cant expect the ps experience to translate to the psp
gameplay is entirely different even with gamebreakers and such
would make a great way to pass time on long flights or rides if there were minigamesi love my psp
ive enjoyed every game ive played for it
lumines however didnt live up to the hype and i just felt cheatedits not as much fun as tetris by any means  its flashier prettier and has better music but it just isnt as fun to play
i found the puzzles really easy until suddenly one was hard and there was nothing to do to try any others
so i got a tip from the internet for that puzzle and then suddenly they were easy ones again until i got bored and stopped
the endless mode got boring before it ever approached being toughafter about  minutes that too was boringi finally sold mine
its not a terrible game and it may be just right for you but i have to recommend trying before you buyi couldnt disagree more with the other reviewers
i played this a bit at my local best buy store and i simply couldnt understand why anyone would pay  plus sales tax for a tetris game because this is what lumines ultimately is
yes its got tons of eye candies and funky music tracks but the gameplay is essential tetris
maybe i didnt spend enough time with it to discover its depth but ill never pay  for a tetris gameis a puzzle game
what more can i write but write that if you like a different styled tetris then jump right inthere are some games that become old in a nice almost fashion way this is not the case
the game is just a terrible graphic really boring and dark racing guided by chance and repetition
not recommended at allthe game has garnered some good reviews and i was impressed with the demo i had played
the beginning was fun and captivating but that was where it ended for me
as i played on i felt like i was playing a game that had ripped off several movies end of days the matrix the crow etc
not only that the game was riddled with cliches especially in regards to the african american copthe gameplay is decent but leaves much to be desired
this is especially evident during cutscenes when you are required to operate the controls
it detracts anyone from paying close attention to the story and ruins the cutscenesthe story seemed to go somewhat smoothly until you get close to the end
so little emphasis is payed to a huge chunck of time that your left wondering what happened what did i missthe most disheartening aspect of the game is that its short
i beat this the same day i bought it on the normal modethe game trys to come off deep but only proved to be thickwittedi recommend to anyone who wishes to play this game to rent itso i bought this game expecting good things
unfortunately its quite overrated  there are a lot of good things going for this game
theres an original idea amazing graphics and a cool story line i guess if you can stand playing it long enough to get to it
the problem with this game is the control and the camera
the camera view is terrible probably the worst ive ever seen in a game
people are complaining about tomb raider legends camera view well this one is a million times worse
its obvious this camera should have been done in a way where you see the character over his or her shoulder and it moves in the direction you move
instead the cameras moving all over the place
it makes it extremely frustrating to find your way around   even if youre just looking for a door in your own apartment
the sprint key is useless too
if you try to sprint to get somewhere faster your character just runs into something quickly
why
because you cant move your character while hes sprinting  he just sprints in a straight line
thats bad control
the other problem with this game is the minigames
you dont experience these in the demo but in the full game your every important action depends not on fpslike moves but on silly little minigames that are exactly the same as a simon says game
so almost this whole games gameplay depends on simon says
thats what im telling you believe it or not
and the other part of the gameplay depends on that crappy camera
sound dumb
well it isthe problem with this game is its a great game in theory  and it could have been a great game in execution but i guess the guy who made this game never really played many games
hes got a lot of cool ideas no doubt about that
but when all your actions depend on simon says well it doesnt really get you into the action
instead of the success of simon says determining whether you beat off a bunch of spiders why not let me actually beat off the spiders
also while the ideas here are original most of the execution of the game is stolen from other games
the sims  grand theft auto san andreas and metal gear solid to be exact
at this point in the game im trying to navigate someone through a military base how is this done
exactly like im playing metal gear solid except with the horrible camera control where i cant tell where im going or whats in front of me
fun
i think not
frustrating
very
you could just trudge through the game saying ok the story will kick in and things will be cool once i get past this dumb part but these dumb parts are just too much of the game at least the part before i gave up
im not even a big adventure game fan but i believe games can be good in any genre
however you need to do something well
if youre going to make a good adventure game dont throw in a bunch of crappy minigames that ruin things
in fact id prefer if there were no action parts at all if theyre done this poorly
the glowing reviews of this game are given just for the story graphics and immersion factoron the positive side i did enjoy the execution of actual choices in an adventure game
you get some control over how the story turns out and supposedly you can go back and play the game a different way and it will end differently
now thats the kind of original thinking that pc games need
also instead of choosing from a stock list of questions the questions you ask actually change the course of things a bit
although i didnt like the time limit on quickly choosing which question to ask based on a vague keyword  perhaps full sentences or removing the time limit would have been better
i also like how you get to play different characters on different sides of the same story
now that is some cool original stuffalso a scene at the beginning where you have to clean yourself up and get dressed quickly was fun
although the camera made it hard and i had to try about  times to get everything done right it was pretty fun
this game should have stuck with its strong points
there are many games that are very limited but stick with their strong points and succeed greatlyand one more thing i forgot to throw in this game uses the arrow keys
are you kidding me
how am i supposed to use the arrow keys and mouse at the same time
its clumsy
i had to reassign the keys to the typical wasd thing that every game uses now
its just another small sign of this game being more of a concept than a fullfleshed game
it is however creative at times very immersive involving and possibly a good sign of things to come from the creator or other game creators in the near futureyes these are the guys responsible for that appalling druids game that came out a few years ago avoid at all costs
this time they actually came out with a  star level game exceptit crashed halfway through the prison scene for who is playing the game and there is no way outjudging by the forums quite a few people are experiencing the same problem
i tried reinstalling the game and using savegames from hepful fellow players but to no avail
the support level is appalling no contact on the hp
this is the last game i buy from these guys perhaps you should think twice before buying the mosi orginally had a different review but then i decided to play the game some more to see if maybe i was a little harsh
and on the contrary i now think i was too generous when i wrote the last review
this game is crap
there is no chalenge and there is almost no customization in the game
you build businesses which just sit there and make money
you can do missions but those are all pretty much the same with some numbers changed not that the first one is fun anyway
the businesses cant be customized other then putting some flags on the building or something simple and stupid like that
it is impossible to go bankrupt to my knoledge
i actually tried you cant actually loose money from your businessesi previously said this game might be good for a kid and i am sticking with that for someone ages  this game might give some moderate entertainment
i will also say the graphics are pretty good though i would switch them for incredably worse graphics if the game was actually fun
i had been looking at this game for a long time almost a year and it just turned out to be garbagei was really excited but it was a big let down to be honestthe editor was also a pain to use and combat was boring
i would not buy thisfirst of all i really wanted to like this game
any game based on an hp
lovecraft tale must be spooky creative and tons of fun right
i think any educated gamer with a respectable sense of survival horror would have to ultimately say no after playing call of cthulhu
it pains me to speak ill of this game as you can tell the developers tried their utmost to give coc an eerie atmosphere tense moments challenging puzzles and fierce enemies
the only one of these aspects they succeeded on is the puzzle part as you will find it an extreme challenge to not throw your controller through the tv screen
its not even because the puzzles are so hard its more to do with the fact that the puzzles are boring and after trying the same tired old jump the chasm pull the lever beat the timer nonsense you find yourself losing interest very quickly
which leads me to the next major annoyance
when you die and you will die the deaths tend to happen obviously at a time where monsters are lurking guns are blazing and puzzles are stumping and coincidentally most of these moments in the game come right after a cut scene
why does this make a difference you ask
because you cant push a button to skip the cut scenes
there were at least five instances where i died multiple times right after a cut scene and had to sit through these four or five minute interludes every single time
thats just sloppy development in my book and it seriously hinders the gameplay experience
my other major gripe is the insanity of the character a blatant ripoff of eternal darkness a game which pulled this off far more effectively
in eternal darkness your insanity would manifest itself with lucid and horrific hallucinations and you truly didnt know what was happening
it was freaky and a rare new experience
in coc your insanity makes itself evident with the screen getting blurry and your character moving as slow as molasses
it gets so blurry at times that you literally cant see a single thing
how is this fun
keep in mind while youre blurryeyed and vulnerable this doesnt stop the enemy from attacking you so it ends up being a prolonged death where you just sit and stare at a blurry screen not knowing what the hell is going on
lameand whats with the fishmen
were they pulled right out of resident evil or what
those of you familiar with the creatures from re
will scoff at these human frogmen jumping at you and easily being mowed down with a wellaimed shotgunthe main problem i have with coc is that it cant decide what it wants to be
i loved the first part of the game where your survival depends on stealth and cunning not bullets and jumping im a big fan of thief so i guess that might tell you something
when the game opens it sets a great mood and tone that ends up dwindling into a tomb raider type shoot jump and leverpull festival that eventually turns into a jawbreaking yawn
it really has no new concepts whatsoever
it pulls ideas directly from thief resident evil and eternal darkness but really bringing nothing of its own to the table
more importantly this game really doesnt create a forboding atmosphere and couldnt be less scary by the time you get to the middle of the game
thats where its creativity should be abounding not sagginggo rent eternal darkness and thief instead
theyre both far superior and honestly call of cthulhu the game not the story wouldnt exist without themi gave up on this during the chase scene when those guys were chasing you in the hotel due to slow controls blurry screens and slow movement
very annoying this game should have been alot betterlook san andreas is a great game no question
if you get any gta game get this one  its truly huge and it truly has it all  it being your basic carjackings your hood tagging your drivebys your pimping your stealth be missions basically every form of sociopathy known to man  in its best incarnation yetthe problem is that rockstar is still trying to wring  out of this rerelease on a dying platform this late in the game
i mean are you serious
i have this title on ps and i would get it for xbox too just cuz i know the graphics probably knock it out of the park  but come on
wasnt even the gtavice city double pack like  when it first came outso screw it
ill stick with my lowres highloadingtime featurepoor ps version till they come out with their nextgen installmentbtw  the people who vote this review unhelpful are retards  just so you all know
i said i like the game
i just dont think they should keep it at this price point
so unless you actually think overpriced games are great you shouldnt be voting me down
  lolill be the first to admit i love sega cd but x was bad from the get go
becuse sega saturn was released about   months after the x it would be like sony making an add on for ps   months before playstion  would be set to come out
the only reason to get this terrible add on is for mk but then again snes was a good port x version was the best next to the arcade
sega cd i recommend but x pick it up at your local sewer for a quarter cause thats where it belongs
but hey its a lot better than nintendos virtual boyalready with the sega cd as an available addon for the genesis and with the bit era around the corner sega released the x a cartridge based addon that promised bit play on a bit system
when you pop it into your genesis along with a x game youll notice that many of these supposed bit games look only a step above bit
what killed the x much like what killed the sega cd was the lack of quality games released for the system
the only game i can recall that was excellent for the x was segas world series baseball and after that everything else is pretty much avaerage
third party support was almost nonexistant except from acclaim but for those who first heard about this addon before it was released it was pretty much known that the x was doomed from the start
below is a list of the best games available for the xworld series baseballvirtua fighterstar wars arcadedoommortal kombat knuckles chaotixpitfall the mayan adventureyeah thats what this thing is just look at it sitting ontop of a perfectly good genesis a tumor
this thing was a horrible idea and would not have happened if there had been a more cohesive structure in segas corporate ladder but unfortunately heres what happened sega of japan made the sega saturn and sega of america made the x
noone wanted the x because the saturn was already out in japan so this thing sunk like a rock
it drew precious resources away from the sega saturn and it killed consumer confidence in sega which they never recovered from
on top of that this thing is ugly
it might not look so bad on the box but thats because they dont show you all the hideous cables you have to hook up to itwith all that said there were a small handful of decent games released on the system unfortunately though almost all of them were ports
there was doom better graphics than snes but inferior music mortal kombat ii star wars arcade virtua fighter pitfall the mayan adventure although not noticeably better than the snes version and all of these are ports
knuckles chaotix is pretty much the only x exclusive title i can think of thats worth mentionin and even that paled in comparison sonic   knuckles and sonic cdi think that if the x had never come out sega would still be making consoles to this day
the sega cd was not successful although its agreed that it does have a decent library of games
customers would have forgiven sega for the sega cds failure because it was a cool innovation that didnt quite take off but when they made a second add on that was a total turd biscuit people simple got frustrated and moved on
its quite fitting that sega chose an advertising campaign for this thing with sexual undertones regarding the insertion of the x into the genesiss cart slot because this thing basically raped the genesis and stole its innocencethis thing can be found for so cheap now though theres not much reason to not buy one just for the novelty of seeing some primitive  bit games running on a genesis
or better yet if youre proficient with a soldering iron you can try your hand at hacking the thing and putting it directly inside of the genesiss casing as some clever hackers have done in the past
this is actually a very cool project because it gives you access to the xs fancy  bit games without having a hideous tumor and extra cables coming out of your system
not recommended for amateurs but still cool none the less
but this thing as a souvenir but for the sake of your genesiss dignity dont leave it plugged in unless your playing a x gamebasically what we have here is the same gameseriously
intelli sys recycled like  of the content from fe in jpn
the only new things here are what youd already expect in a sequel anyway a new plot and new character designswhy would anyone pay full price to play exactly the same game all over again
it boggles the mind
on the pc we have what are called expansion packs
this sequel does nothing new what the previous game hasnt already done
and the previous one which ive reviewed wasnt that impressive eitherin short go ahead and buy this if you liked the first one and want more of the same
if the previous fire emblem didnt do much for you however dont expect anything differentthis is the kind of title i hate to talk bad about but i would lack integrity if i didnt
woe is meas a diehard rpg fan of the old days nes and snes rockin the best ones in my opinion i couldnt help but desire an rpg maker
after all i dont buy pc titles unless they include the very important words map editor included or something similarfor me customization is my game
i typically spend hundreds of hours probably thousands more like it just in the customization of games as i make scenarios and then tie them to my campaigns
by golly i do it because i want to see how they play out
not to mention the pride in creating a cool game for myself or others  knowing full well the makers of the map editors are the real champs
rpg maker  bless its little heart falls short in so many different ways that i only have a meager recommendation for the title
the negatives are too great to mention like having what seem like bit graphics instead of  or awkward interfaces and character movements even for folks like me who cherish this line of work
however here comes my bleak recommendationi will support all things associated with classic rpgs until the day i die
in fact it was final fantasy that inspired me to do this sort of thing
my dream is to make an old school final fantasyquality rpg some day
rpg maker  is the next step to do that shy of dropping cash to get an advanced education a new pc new skills and programming software and booksso in reality my recommendation is that you support all things rpg trying to find ways to make them popular in todays society
obviously we rpgers are a small number comparatively speaking
but titles like rpg maker  are our voice in this world of fastbuttonpushing video games that seem to corner the us marketthis title was made for us even if it cant compare to final fantasy  through  no matter how good you are with itin all reality if you love classic rpgs you will like rpg maker   to love it would require a different desire regarding rpgs i would think
but your creative imagination will not decrease from utilizing this product however and rpg is the name of the game
this one is for us good or badrpg maker  is a software program designed to help newbie coders learn how to make their own adventure game
as you might expect some people think it is great  and others find it very limitedmany modern games come with level creators so most people who are interested in game design have given a try at putting together a level or two
you lay out the rooms add in textures add in a few character models and then see how things go
you quickly learn just how much actual work is involved in designing a level that is enjoyable
its not just about adding halls and doors
its about designing a world that seems realistic that is fun to explore and that provides challengesthat all being said the toolset that you use to create your world should be as easy to use as possible
since designers themselves often use inhouse level design tools to create their own game levels that should make sense
im not sure therefore why the rpg maker  tools seem so cumbersomeyes the user needs to be able to think in d space and yes they must have a keyboard
thats not an unreasonable request if youre typing in dialogue
and yes the user needs a few memory cards
when im doing song creation on my home pc i have a very large hard drive to work with
i completely expect when im designing games on my ps that i have a few memory cards to work with to save variations of my games and keep backup copiesthat all being said the game tools should be very easy to use well organized and easy to see
rpg maker  just doesnt seem to come through on those points
the command sets are not always intuitive
the graphics are not ps worthy
and the components you would think the actual components you had to work with would be relatively high quality
but theyre not
the textures character models sounds animations and virtually every other aspect of your building blocks could really be improved
this is in essence the easiest part of the software product for them to have done right
there are trillions of character models out there in a wide variety of games
why only provide a few stereotypical ones
ps developers have done some amazing things with textures and organic objects
why give us cheezy lowrez versions
it was really rather surprising the low level of items provided with which to make your gamei am a developer and i fully realize how hard it is to create a game
i understand that the best games come from learning the actual base level language that the console understands and to work with that
that being said i have used many level generators for games which are easy to use and which provide amazingly good graphics
usually those level generators are provided as free bonus items included with a full length regular game
for this rpg maker to sell as a standalone software product  and to have poorer level generation and building blocks  makes little sense to menot well recommendedok first off i made  game on rpg maker  and the were a joy to make
i am also getting rpg maker  for christmas
rpg maker  is just sooooo limited
on rpg maker  you could customize your own characters and you had over a hundred models to choose from
on rpg maker  you only have about  and you cant customize them at all
the spells look crappy and you really cant customize the way they look
on rpg maker  you have the image editor which allows you to do many things
as far as i know you cant make buildings cant put random battles in towns and you are very limited on how you can make a dongeon look
all of this you can do in rpg maker ok now for the good stuff
first off you can see yourself in battle which is something you couldnt do in the other two
second the graphics are way better than the other two games so if you are big on graphics like my mom is this is definitly the version for you
but most important of all its so easy to use i mean seriously it took me not even a whole week if i add the entire time up together to figure out everything where as on rpg maker  i had to end up buying the guid and dont worry if your buying rpg maker  get the guide its on here as wellso yeah if youre an absolute newbie to the series or picky on grapics trust me youll want to get this version
but if youre exsperienced with this series and really dont give a hoot about graphic pass this up because you probably wont like itthe armored core series has had a rusty life the last few years
despite a cult following the mech customization video game has lost its touch time and time again
with the psp version armored core formula front this trend continues
formula front isnt as bad as the recent ps outing nine breaker but arguably so
i wouldnt consider this an action game as much as id consider it a big game of chess where the pawns and bishops are replaced with guns and different body parts of each robotin armored core formula front you are the engineer and leader of a team in the mech league known as the ffa
you customize and alter five of your very own mechs each of which you try to differentiate in order to formulate strategic gameplans and strategies
through winning matches you progress through the ffa ranks and eventually become the top ac team
throughout the experience youll be informed of all the latest ffa and team rules youll be challenged by beaten opponents and more
this stuff kept me into the experience more than i expectedcustomizing your mechs is the name of the game here and you could spend hours on each of your hulking robots
each of the dozens and dozens of parts have different parameters that alter the performance of your ac
you can equip your mech with the strongest weaponry around but those big guns will bog you down and overheat your mech faster than youd ever believe
of course smaller guns make way for better agility and terrain movement as well as decreased energy use and better cooling
equipping parts isnt the only thing youll do
in fact youll tune those parts replace them set the acs personal artificial intelligence and more
its all about your personal preferences and of course the competition ahead
if youre about to go up against a defensively weak but speedy ac you will want to plan accordingly and try to counter the ac with a speedy but powerful mech
if youre about to face a beefy pile of steel youll want to slow down the pace and have enough power to outlast your opponent perhaps from long range
if youre into this kind of customization youre going to absolutely love formula front
its like a slower virtual game of chess that involves robots and guns
if you dont to put it bluntly youre going to hate this gamein the japanese version of this game you couldnt actually play as your mechsyou could make them coordinate their ai and watch them fight
in the american version you can actually control your acs on the battlefield but the controls are so broken and the computer ai is so good that playing the game is a worthless effort
i eventually gave up and decided to watch the mechs fight instead
fortunately the graphics are very attractive and the mech action is fastpaced and exciting to watch
after playing a few matches i decided to stick to watching my mechs after tuning the ai and i had a much better time
im very upset though that its not as fun to play formula frontas i said the visuals are topnotch
this is a very attractive psp game
youll scope out individual parts and intricate details on your mechs
explosion effects and particles look fantastic
overall formula front looks like a second or thirdyear playstation  game
the music isnt bad eitherand when paired with the explosive sound effects realistic warning sounds and gunfire this title is a nicelypresented game
of course it doesnt have an excuse to be anything otherwise
if a games actual gameplay is indended to be observed rather than played the game in mind should look and sound fantastic
this is forumla fronts saving grace and if youre one of the people i said would love the game earlier these factors will only improve the experience to youi regret to report the rest of the psp crowd that armored core formula front isnt the action game youre looking for
armored core fans might enjoy it for its customization and impressive superficial qualities but almost anyone else will immediately regret a purchase because there isnt much gameplay involved
from software i know youre capable of making an armored core that is more fun to play than watch
please do it next time
note this review also appeared on another website that i write for on a regular basisthis game sucks
i was shocked to learn that even though you have a great console ps xbox etc
you can get games that contain graphics from bit designs
unless youre a hardcore fan of the title dont get this game
its like they took a nintendo game from  and allow you to play it on your xbox
wheres the update
i live in the new millennium and i expect my games even d fighters to have outstanding graphicsa few years ago the coolest thing to ever happen to gaming came to the playstation   wide open game playing
give the game player a city and let them go
give them a story to follow but also give them some room to play and create their own story
give the gamer multiple ways to accomplish the goalsthis game is the exact opposite
time after time while i was playing batman begins i kept going from level to level and situation to situation and theres is only one way or very few ways to accomplish each thing
if you dont do things a certain way you are riddled with bullets and killed in secondsthere is no room for creativity
you have no choice but to defeat the bad guys in the exact same way that the gamewriter planned itthis gets very old very fastof all superhero games that should adapt a wideopen theme
batman is it
come on gamewriters
gotham city for godsakes
let us have some funplease give us a batman meets grand theft auto mix and well love you for itanyway this game is a thrown together repetitive mess
dont get me wrong its a lot of fun playing as batman and the graphics are pretty good
but after completing about half the game and getting killed  times everytime you enter a room with thugs until you get it down the way the gamewriter intended it the game looses its excitementafter  levels of the game you are all of sudden in the batmobile or the tumbeler
no explanation
no reason
but all of a sudden you are racing through gotham chasing after dozens of bad guys in cars and running them down or running them off the road
why
i dont know
theres was no story to it
or reason
just do itthrown together pointless repetitive promotional tooli mean come on  i can see how hard it would be for someone to actually create a brand new character like say ratchet  clank or rynn  arohk or claire  chris redfield and have the gaming world embrace them but how do you screw it up when you have an already established character that everybody already loves like batmani tell you how you give them a one dimensional game that is about as fun as figuring out the maze in your local newspaper
instead of giving them a game that lets the game player use their own mind to figure out the best way to be batmangive us gotham city
give us random crimes
give us a game where is it up to us if his identity is figured out
what crimes were gonna fight
who were gonna save
the makers of spiderman  figured this outi wont buy another batman game until they give us the wide open grand theft auto format
give us gotham city to explorethis game actually sort of insults your intelligence as an individual
the game writer is basically saying that hes the only one that knows the proper way to fight each thug and each situation
keep your creative ideas to yourselfmy favorite super hero is batman
the graphics is all right
but everything else is garbage
you do the same thing every level
you grapple here interogate him get the password
scare these guys they get so called terrified
beat them up game over
i got one wordgarbageyes i am over  and i cant spell
all i need to know how to spell is garbage
i like this reveiw stuffthe storyline in and of itself is an interesting silent hillish storyline
i have no problems with the storyline
what gets me is the fact that it has terrible physics
first
it had much to offer but the very fact that the camera angles are naught well then you get the idea
camera angle manipulation is very important at least for me because by using camera angles you can see and do things like examining clues studying hallways combat etc
but when you cant like this game it is hard to work the game
second the use of tools healing potions etc
is also very complicated
you have to do hit buttons while trying not to get killed
but usually you do end up getting killed simply because you cant do two things very well at once
thats why i have a problem with this game
maybe you yourself could work these problems but i have a hard time doing sothe story is decent the premise and setting is ok  but this game borders on unusable sometimes
there is no save system
pathetic on a  title
you can play  minutes looking for some bizarre thing that they hid in the game and get killed at the last minute
another  minutes playing the same thing again
argh  i thought we were past that years ago
f guys fthen theres the controls
the book tells you very little about what to do in the game
i wandered around for  or  sections of the game not knowing what to do with the darn scanner
also there seems to be a total lack of health when you need it most and an abundance when you dont need it
didnt the developers play this thing before they shipped it
totally wierd
and there are so many cut scenes and cinematics its hard to get into the rythmand then the most troubling thing
i love these fps games far cry doom  half life  etc
play them all
but area  i find it very hard to see where i am
the action is pretty wierd which is ok it is a fictional game after all but because of how murky the controls are and how wide the field of vision of the character is i end up with a headache trying to see where i am half the time
its hard to know where the shots are coming from and where the enemy is
its hard to describe but the field of vision is just lousy
and for a first person game thats indeed badall in all very disappointing
i can see why it didnt to that well
its klunky has poor playability and its hard to see whats going on
too bad actually as the story is not that bad david duchovny while bland as heck in this at least is a real actor and area  is steeped in fantasy lore as a subject in general
all in all a bargain bin speciali was really looking forward to area  but i was rudely dissapointed by its bland mediocre singleplayer campiagn with absolutely no replayability
its fun to play through one time but not twice
i couldnt even get the multiplayer to work
trust me go back and replay half life  a few more times unless your really aching for something a little differentmake no mistake this was a promising idea
the initial concept is interesting and the gameplay especially when your characters powers reach a godlike magnitude can be fun
however none of that adds up to a game worth the value of the box it comes infirst off the game is not finished
ever played kotor 
hated the fact that the ending seemed rushed and unfinished
not only is this ending even less polished it cuts off on purpose
without the phantom sequels to fill in the plot holes this is a terrifically weak story something im frankly surprised an author like card would be willing to put his name on
the characters are illdefined and not particularly interesting or charming
the game makes vague references to cards books but neither attempts to explain the setting to nonfans nor explain what has happened between the books and advent rising for instance why does the destruction of edumea bring the human race near extinction
what happened to all the other planets colonized by humanity
the plot that does exist in the game is barebones
for example at one point a bounty hunter is sent after main character gideon wyeth and says that hed been hoping to capture him alive
why
who wants him alive and what do they want him for
perhaps these questions were meant to be answered in the sequels that will likely never come out
if so its a pretty flimsy excuse and not a very good way to endear yourself to your audience unless there is a large audience of people who like paying for a full story in a number of fullpriced installmentsif you are one of those people you will be disappointed because unless things change quite a bit you arent going to be able to get the rest of the series for love or money
and if you arent youll be as bitterly disappointed as i wasthe latest madden game has a lot of new wrinkles including completely revamped passing controls but in my opinion the designers did not address the most serious weaknesses of the game
instead they added a lot of gimmicks like superstar mode which gets boring quicklythe two biggest weaknesses of the madden series from the beginning have been  you cannot see everything that happens and  the computer seems to think the field of play is twodimensional
i understand that it would be virtually impossible to create a game that allows you to control all eleven players at once but madden can be frustrating because your teammates often do incredibly stupid things on the fieldlike stand around while the receiver theyre supposed to be covering gets openand since you cant see the whole field during the action there are many times when you dont even realize what happened until you watch on instant replayits very clear from all the interceptions that the computer must be thinking of the field as essentially a twodimensional space
in other words it seems to forget that there is height tooor at least it doesnt do enough to take height into consideration
basically as long as a defender stands somewhere between the passer and the receiver he has a chance to intercept the ball even if the receiver has beaten him badly and the ball should have been thrown way over his head
precision passing doesnt seem to have eliminated this problem
and it works the other way too as a defender i intercept passes i have no business intercepting
this is also part of the reason why there are too many turnovers in the game
the other reason is that everyone fumbles too much
on the plus side the kicking controls make much more sense now and the graphics are only getting better
i also get the feeling that you have a little more time as a qb in madden  one of my gripes about the older versions was that you didnt have enough time as a passer for receivers to run their routes
almost everything had to be a quick passadd it all up and im afraid im not going to buy madden next year
yes theyve worked on it but its still basically the same gamei hadnt upgraded madden since the  version
i could tell i wasnt missing much
in fact the game has taken a couple of steps backwards
maybe it is different on the console boxes but on the pc there are a bunch of problems raymond james stadium home of the buccaneers
i had to pause the game and go to the camera to zoom in on the boat in the end zone
why
because it looks like a grey elephant from the field
 raymond james again
tampa bays colors are red  black
what color are the fans dressed in
blue
 in franchise mode just play  cover   no need to change the play call everyoull be the  defense with lots of ints
 people on the sidelines look like they are wearing masks and their entire animation is to move back and forth
 win the superbowl and the gatorade tub is dumped on the coach but there is no graphics for the water
 let the play clock count down to  seconds and the center will always start pointing at the defense
 as the game goes on teams in white get the exact same stains on all their uniforms
 superstar mode is a great idea but a joke
you are given stupid choices throughout and when it is time to renew your contract your choices are let the agent choose your salary or try to leave your team so you have a choice of  offers
when you retire youd think there would we some sort of end game farewell
well sorry it just goes back to the main menu
there is a cell phone option where you get messages from a veteran and your agent etc
the messages are the same from one year to the next
for  seasons my qb superstar got the same message over and over saying grats on being a starter nowi never tried the online aspect of the game but the single player options are badim sorta mad why did ea have to buy the frikken license
all they did was get lazy and decide to get rid of the better competition
i like madden but this is just pathetic ea is a bunch of lazy bums who hate competitionim disappointed to say that im not surprised
as soon as ea signs an exclusive license deal with the nfl they get lazy in their product
sure the new quarterback feature adds another level of realism but it was poorly implemented and needs a lot of work to bring it to where it should bepros the new quarterbacking system thankfully it can be turned off is a pretty cool idea
gone are the days when you can simply drop your quarterback  yards behind the line of scrimmage and heave bombs to receivers you cant even see
defenders will now read your line of sight allowing you to look off a defender or throw easy interceptions because you telegraphed your pass by not looking to other receivers
i think this will be really cool when some of the bugs are worked out
its just clunky and you have far too many controller operations to pull off in a short amount of time
expect to be sacked  fold until you get comfortable with it the superstar mode
the ability to create a player follow and shape his career
hire and fire your agent  determine your players genetic makeup score a part in a movie thats itthats all that new in this freakin gameconsthis is where it gets fun absolutely no change in presentation
the game looks and plays other than the quarterback mode which thanfully can be disabled exactly as   the only changes seem to be updated rosters and player ratings
a huge disappointment considering they have exclusive rights to the espn presentation formerly held by nflk
the commentary even seems to be identical superstar mode kind of sucks
decisions you make seem to have little or no impact to your players ratings
there just seems to be no logic in how different choices and outcomes affect your player
this mode while cool in theory really was not played out well in the quarterback mode if you throw a pass to a receiver not in your line of sight youll throw the most ridiculous dead duck that youll ever see
these guys are nfl quarterbacksive see children that can throw a tighter spiral the online mode has a painful registration process
you basically have to pay  to keep espn from spamming your email
infuriatingbottom linenot only did ea get lazy as a result of the lack of competition in nfl video games lack how about none but they bumped the price of the games back up to 
save yourself the money and rent first
ill stick with this may be the worst madden installment in  years
i really miss tecmo bowl for the super nintendo you actually felt like you had control over your players and it was fun to play
madden football games have succeeded in making playaction passes useless
every single time you choose any type of playaction pass by the time your qb is away from the rb he will be sacked
there is a defender hitting you sometimes before you even fake the handoff
not only is the playaction the worst play you can call but you just dont feel like you have control over any players
the moves are slow and robotic and you just dont feel good about it if you juke somone
its like being on ice skates the whole game
i have also found that  hasnt addressed the problem of qbs with speed being able to dominate
michael vick can still roll out on every play and out run the entire defense
he can pass or run and get the st down  out of  times
i just dont think they play test these games long enough before theyre released
the makers of madden need to have  yearolds in the studio playing this game for a week straight trying to find cheap plays and glitches
if you know nothing about football at all this game will seem good to you but just watch more than  minutes on tv and you can see there is absolutely nothing realistic about this gamemadden used to be the king of sports game and still sells millions
but now for the second year in a row its not even the best football game
last year and this year ncaa football is so superior to madden its not even funny
last year ncaa had some problems with defensive back ninjas jumping halfway across the field to knock down balls
well this year they fixed it and there are no complaints about ncaa
it rocks
last year amongst a million other things you couldnt run the ball on madden
well this year again there are countless problems with madden that make it pale in comparison to the vastly superior ncaa football
the most apparent thing is that ncaa is just so much more fluid of a game it plays like a football game does in real life and it plays like madden used to  years ago when it was still good
ea needs to sit down and find a good developer to remake madden because this madden almost a clone of last years totally forgettable tony bruno cratastic madden blowshey guys its yet another madden title
the same as 
yep
ea makes the same crap over and over
espn sold better then madden last year becuase  it was a better game also was rated higher in  of ratings
better graphics and acurate models
madden is lame and ea is a retarded game maker
all ea games are bad and cheap
get espn  becuase its better then this lame title
why spend  on the exact same damn game as the other yearsfor the most part the gameplay wasnt touched in this game
so if youve played ncaa  which has a fantastic running game going back to maddens is a big step backwards
ncaa is alot more fluid realistic and  most importantly  funthey have added updates that nobody wants
qb visions is poorly executed
the joystick is too sensitive making it nearly impossible to pick up the game and play it right out of the boxnothing much was added to franchise
there is a new nfl superstar mode which seems pretty cheezy
its mostly you just reading emails and newspapers in between gamesfun rightea needs to quit adding new features and focus on the overall gameplay
madden  just isnt fun to play
maybe thats because it still feels like madden  except with more difficult controls this time aroundsadly there are no other options for nfl games this year thanks to the monopoly ea has with the league
if you want a good football fix thats fun to play pick up ncaa this is a disasterous game
you can not make it through franchise mode without playing the same game  times because of the software conflicts which turns off the system completely
along with it shutting off the psp the graphics are not that far from the playstation and there is no play reviews
no challenges
i thought this year there are challenges
again too bad madden signed his life over to ea sports
do not buy this game seriously
ea games on the other hand has burnout legends
it is a worthy game the graphics are outstanding
i suppose each division of ea has its own standards
dont fault ea games fault ea sportsi bought my psp at midnight on its debut night at wally world
i do love it to death but its not quite a big success in my mind just yet
the future i believe will be awesome though for the psp
with these game developers making games for the psppsand ps i understand they have alot on their plate
but this is bullt
i love madden football and i was just waiting and waiting for this game to come out
but i could of waited another  months if it meant for a better game
other reviewers have said it all
the glitches and pauses just suck
there are other problems but everyone else has covered that already
why do these game developers especially ea rush these titles out
we are gonna jump on a madden game no matter what and you know they know that
i would be embarassed if i was an ea employee because of this game
i will say in its defense that it does have some good qualities
 its football on the go
 the graphics  although not real impressive are fine to me
the game just doesnt flow right with the pauses and delays
the load times are pretty long but it is madden and with all the rosters and stuff i expected that
i realize when a new system comes out it takes awhile for the developers to learn it so i know the games in the future will be kick assthis message is for ea  make psp ncaa  football with the fixed glitches that are in madden and ill forever be a fanfirst of all let me clear this up there is a bug or glitch with madden  for xbox which will make your game freeze up on occasion
besides being infuriating it is indicative of how rushed this game feels
there is nothing you can do to fix it but feel free to do a google search on the problem and you will see what i meanive been playing madden since the very first game in  and by and large the series has had an amazing ability to reinvent itself and keep improving year after year
madden  marks the first time in memory that a madden game has clearly not only failed to improve but has actually regressed
i ended up selling back my copy of  and have gone back to playing whats new
first is the unfortunate brainchild of developers starved for innovation the unfortunate invention known as qb vision which basically makes passing more awkward and more difficult than it already was without really bringing anything to the table its not more fun its not more realistic since my eyes scan my receivers anyhow but it is more frustrating
the whole scheme stinks of change for changes sake and i bet that it will be gone from madden  on xbox another addition is the superstar mode which should be somewhat familiar to those whove played ncaa football  and its heisman mode
the idea is awesome you create a player then lead him through his career managing the on and offfield activities hopefully making him a big star
while the notion of a sportsrpg is genius the implementation stinks
superstar mode ends up being about repetitive practice sessions and clicking through endless and boring text menus
yawn
also why couldnt ea sports combine superstar with franchise mode
many players create themselves and place themselves on their favorite teams so why notthe rest of the game is basically the same
the graphics arent that much better and the animations have a few more flavors but thats about it
the truck stick is a nice addition but for some reason ea changed the controller layout
yet more change for changes sake if it actually improves play then go for it but it it doesnt why mess with itthe games longstanding ai flaws are still there
the secondary can be either incredibly telepathic cpu opponents and break off plays with supermantype reaction times or utterly idiotic user players
when a rated cornerback gets beaten regularly by a mediocre receiver then the ai stinks
the middle linebackers and their amazing jetpacks are back for another season meaning that a team with a semidecent mlb patrolling the middle is good for endless deflections and picks since he can jump about  feet in the air
last but not least the kick return and punt return gameplay is still beyond horrible
there is no blocking since your cpu teammates are incapable of recognizing the lb behemoth heading for your returner and will just stand there while you get creamed and fumble the ball
this is inexcusable
why is it that its so hard to program a game in which a returner gets even average stats
most players will be lucky if they get  yards on a punt return to be fair i am referring to the high difficulty levels with a superspeedy returner
yet when you check the stats there will always be some joker who averages  yards per returnthat said its still a fun game especially since you can turn off qb vision and change the controller layout to the classic template from   but then what is the point of buying coded arms has many of the ingredients of a great fps but the meal just wasnt cooked yet
it reminds me of another konami ps launch game zone of enders
while they are two totally different games their position was similar to be the pioneer of a new genre on a new system
both have outstanding visuals controls that took some getting used to and not much more to offer
like zone of enders coded arms isnt a terrible failure but it isnt exactly fun or memorable either
the controls are easy enough to learn but dont lend themselves to precision generally required in fps which is forgivable
a bigger mistake is the endless sameness of the enemies and the levels
a box is a box no matter how you dress it up so it is pointless to say every gamer will experience this differently as a rationale for the randomly generated level design
the ai is nonexistent so every room is more or less a death match between you and the allotted number of enemies
i have this lurching suspicion that there is a trend amongst game developers to make lesser versions of games in the name of portability see metal gear acid or metroid prime hunters
i mean really if this came out on the ps xbox or gamecube no one would give it the time of day
the handhelds available these days are capable of so much more
so you can be desperate and call this best on the psp or great game or you can call it what it isi find the graphics and the game to both be excellent and enjoyable
the problem i have is with movement
i wish they wouldve made the game a one player game and incorporate the mouse into the movement better
it is just far too hard to move around and do thingsnormally pc is my way to go for games i prefer pc over all other formats
but this time around ive got to recommend that you go for either the xbox ps or gamecube versions insteadmany pc games today are adapted from console games instead of being built from the ground up with a computer enginemany pc games especially now wont run because of security programs anticopying devices conflicting with the pc owners drivers
basically what that means is that the game may or may not run depending on whether or not the anticopy program accounts for your driver expensive or cheapubisoft has a disclaimer on many of their games including their th anniversary myst edition claiming in fine print found with a magnifying glass that the game may not run because of the installed security program and driver conflictsea games had to post a work around to their security program for many of their games last november   eas anticopying security program  basically shut sown the game if a burner program was detected on the hard drivethere are many people who are having serious trouble with the narnia game
it is not their fault
it is not because they are whining
it is not because they are doing something wrong or their computer didnt meet the requirementsit is because game companies would prefer not to mess with pc cdroms because they can be copied
game companies are slowly whittling down their pc divisions with the ultimate goal of closing them to concentrate on console games such as interplay did with black isle studios on december  
they are not hiding it
game companies dont like making pc gamesnarnia is another adapted game
it is not built for pcs
the gof potter game is another adapted game and another fiascoi believe that pc games are a wonderful fun way for kids to learn about computers
i dont like what is going on with the game companies but what i like less is the pc community at large blaming parents instead of being outraged at what the game manufacturers are getting away withwhen you buy a legal game and bring it home to play on your legal computer  and it wont play because of a legal  cd burner probably installed by the pc manufacturer that to me is illegalits so much easier to blame the parentsthe narnia game is a beautiful game especially when it playsicksnay on the pc version
the ps version is the way to go but xbox and gamecube versions will also nicely doand they will play
parents wont then be blamed for a situation out of their controlmjhi do not know if the screen size is the same for the psp original and the psp because i only have the slim
if they are the same size then this hori product does not fit either
there is going to be a wide gap between the screen edges with this protector with the slimthe supplied cloth is junk
it is not microfibre and has so much lint and cloth particles on it you are better off using a tshirtit is made of the static high quality screen material and what it does cover it covers well however
there are no air bubbles when applied correctly
it is very easy to mess this up when applying though so be prepared to make a few expensive mistakesi know hori also makes a psp version of this screen but this is not it
maybe that fits betterlike some of the other reviews mention nonamazon sellers sell a different brand of filter than the advertised hori on this page
ive received a brand called cisco or some other but i figured what the hey its only a few bucks  sad to say it already has a lot of scratches from only a few days of play dont see how
its not even a touch screen
but its done what it was supposed to do kindai could not get rid of even most of the air bubbles and the screen protector itself is just too small for a proper fit to the screen anywayi also purchased the javoscreen by javoedge and am far happier with it
they make one for the both psps original and slim it fits the screen better and comes with an applicator to get out all the air bubbles
i also gave a review for itsee it here on amazoncom atsony playstation portable slim psp javoscreen anti glare screen protector screen onlyi cannot recommend the hori i would recommend the javoedge instead for your psp screen protection needs
edit inserted link and grammatical correctionsi tried swg out the day it came out but due to the name i picked for my character i had a customer service problem
basically they they arbitrarily changed my name and i lost access to all of buildings things i had for sale on the market etc
i was so irate with the customer service and their total disregard for the problems that the name changed caused that i quit after exactly the first  days
the offensive name
reichfuhreranyway my friend has gotten back into it and suggested that i do the same
so i bought this expansion and started totally from scratch
the new name
riik furer hehehethe combat has definately changed
first few levels are pretty easy but but by level  or so you will have difficulty killing creatures of level  or  meaning you will die quite a bit if you try
this really slows your progress down
you attack something equal to your level and you are dead period
this just plain sucks
im hopeful that the cu as they call it will be tuned to fix this but ill bail out at the end of  days if there is no progressthe space combat is a little herkyjerky but not too bad
i think the fights should go a little faster and the some of the mission engagements are way too hard
the imperial mission to intercept and kill the lok captains is an example of a mission that is virtually impossible to complete without helpthere is enjoyable aspects to this game but there are many problems that go along with it and many obviously disgruntled players leaving the gameabout  days ago i bought the total exprience package and installed it
i was hoping for a really immersive star wars expierience
little that i know that all i got from this game was excessive lagi do have high power rig by the way and a level system that screams hours worth of grind to achieve anything
i will cancell before my  days will run out
the game is quite a dissappointment to me and i can see a lot of others see it that way toothere are  levels in this game
if you want to be of any signifigancewith the age of the game playerbase you have to be past or near lvl  or so
the way this game is structured post cu you have to spend endless hours of your time trying to level up so you can start to have real fun and get to the meat of this game
if you are groupie kind of person things might work out good for you as this game rewards groupingif say you can find someone higher level than you to group with than you level at their rate of xp and thus gains level fast
but if you are trying to solo the game than you are out of luck or in for a grueling  hours daily grind trying to play cat and mouse with mobs near your own level
forget about engaging mobs even  level higher than your own or prepare to do lots of runs to the cloning center
for explicable reasons i will be fighting mobs of my own level during a mission and from nowhere this highlevel mob will show up and one shot kill me and i wake up at the dreaded clonning center
sometimes i get ambushed by much higher levels mobs when i am trying to ride to my own level mission waypoint
the entertainers have almost left the game and you get noone to heal your fatigue or battle wounds in the cantina which are mostly emptyi saw many time mos eisley cantina completely emptycan you imagine that in a star wars universe and its supposedly one of their major selling point about this gamein a nutshell this game is no longer designed for or supports a casual player post cu upgrade
i work fulltime attend college so i only have few hours to play and those are mostly odd hours too
i cant spend  hour of my total  hours of gameplay searching for groups
and some people like to play mmo and not neccesarily group and i beleive mmo should accomdate that tooi intially wanted to be a jedi but the path to jedi is an endless grind of months for the casual gamer
and i have heard that the jedi have been nerfed a lot
so initially when they become jedis and have to be overt that cant hold their own against score of bounty hunters sent to hunt themthe grpahics of the ground layers is showing its age too but they still do the job of potraying star wars envoirment to a satisfactory extent
all the major cities have termendous lag most of the time
other cities are almost deserted
i came from wow and this game seems to be a deserted island compared to that game
once you leave newbie areas population becomes sparse to almost empty cities in most casses
i guess lots of people have left
a friend of mine playing for couple of years and recently quit told me the game used to be highly populated but over the years and expecially post cu the population has dropped
i am btw on a famous server called ahazithe space layer though looks good with detailed ship models and fight cgi but is boring and repititive
it pales in comparsion to the earlier star wars simulators like xwing tie fighter etc
for a long time until you start to reach tier  you will be doing only  kinds of mission
either ecort a frieghter or just midlessly keep on shooting down npcs who run around you in circles only with really bad and campy dialogue
from tier  onwards you get more in depth mission but they are designed to be played with someone and take anywhere from  minutes to about an hour
if you plan to solo goodluck past tier  can be done but get ready for an excercise in frustation
i have heard the final mission to get master pilot is near impossible unless you have high level friends to accompany you
the only thing good about space layer is the good loot or components you get to sell for decent credits or use to equip your upgraded shipsin all a severe letdown of a game
its sad to see how soe has squandered such an excellent concept with a substandard runofthemill eq clone
its sad to see how games like kotr republic commando and even battlefront has done more justice to star wars by creating a immersive and satisfying universe with no online fees
no wonder they are selling the original game with all the expansions for less than  bucks
back in its heydays two years ago the orginal game retailed no less than  bucksback to jedi academy multiplayer where i can be a dual lightsabre weilding jedi right here and now not six months down the roadthis game was  stars at launch in june  it was so much fun before everyone got composite armor the time that raiding ancorhead was fun
the game then turned bad when jedi came out then it got worse over timei loved raiding rebel bases and having huge fights with my imperial master rifleman
that was probably the best part of the game but over time that died out too then soe took turrets away and then they released the combat upgrade which ruined the game and made the combat seem like every other game out there
in my mind they could of kept the old combat system with just a few changes like make rifleman dissapear off the map  when they go under cover i loved the fast paced action of the old combat systemin the time of not to many jedi it was fun to get a group of  players to just take out   rebel jedi but now regular players are rare instead of jediif they would just take the game back to where it was in oct  back when you could have out  troopers and a atst  instead of now where you only can have one and just get rid of composite armor then the game would be goodback then when there was no speederbikes and right before player cities came out it felt like a adventure to have a house way far out in the middle of no where in lok i would set out  houses with my friend and some harvestors to mine for resoures and a ton of dangerous creatures were always coming around one time a huge kimogila came onto our property we had to sick our troopers and atst on it just to survivecause if we died we would have ot walk all the way out there againmy crazy rodian friend died but me  being a medic i dragged him into the house and rezed him  that was so much fun but now that fun is ruined since speeders came out and now everyone has mastered professions there is no danger of creatures and there is wayyy too many houses you can berly see any land left
i love the weather effects like the rain on naboo and the sand storms on tatooine and lok
and i love the houses and how you can customize themover all this game could of been the best ever but a few mistakes goes a long wayi just hope lucasarts makes a new starwars online game one thats not a mmorpg somthing more like planetside but not all combatif this game would of been managed by a company like blizzard then we wouldnt of had all these problems to begin withi just bought a piano black pspk mostly for movies while travelling and thought this case would offer good protection while in my bag which it does
the reason that i gave it  stars is that one of the best features for my intended purpose was the  degree hinge to make a stand while watching movies
unfortunately the pspk headphone jack is in a place thats covered just barely so theres no way to use this a stand and have your headphones plugged in
the wireless onoff is also covered so thats useless as welli think it should be noted in the product description that this item doesnt work well other than protection for the pspk
unfortunatei bought this with the belief that the top was matte plastic and the sides were at least faux chrome if not real chrome
ends up the entire thing is shiny clear plastic which the above photo does not let on at all
it shows every fingerprint
i do not like it at allhey listen this is a stupid game and killing just germans and if u really want a good game that doesnt bite u in the rear end like it did me rite after i bought it then get medal of honor frontlineplease save your money by buying the original harvest moon at half price
it is very nearly the same gamesame townspeople same conversations same animals same farm
if you remember the original the girl has to choose from a few of the eligible batchelors gustafa marlin or rockythey didnt even add potential mates for heri dont know why another wonderful life came out so long after the original because they basically kept the format changed the boy to a girl made a few subtle changes and marked it for saleif youre a huge fan and want to check out the new versionrent it
keep the old one and start over if you feel like playing the game again
hopefully i save you the  i wastedi bought this game expecting to be amazed at how cool the graphics looked i was impressed
at the graphics
the gameplay on the other hand sucks
driver on gbc was way more entertaining than this garbagethe goodgraphics are way ahead of gameboy standersthe badthe cops sit there and smile at you while you run over the civilions of miami
you drive like youre drunk
you cant shoot from your car or even at certain anglesthe uglythis game had potential to be a great game but it was garbage because they didnt make it as smooth as it should of beendont buy this game
i find it so funny how people who dont even own the game come on here and say that its such a great game
i bought this game along with metal slug advanced and wolfenstein d i can promise you that i will not be playing drivr any time soon
not to mention im gonna buy doom    soon so this game is gonna be gathering dust for the next  years on my shelf
dont buy itshiny games dropped the ball with enter the matrix back in  they rushed their product to meet the release date of matrix reloaded and the flaws were evident in a game riddled with bugs and an awful design
somehow the game still sold millions of copies and drove shiny to create another matrix video game
sadly matrix path of neo isnt much better than enter the matrix
it isnt as loaded with bugs and glitches but its a game that could have been smoothened out with another few months of developmentin path of neo you put your arms through the leather sleeves of neos trench coat and take on all of his abilities in the process
the story revolves around him and throughout the game its your goal to learn new abilities and the ways of the matrix while also doing missions from the movies
in between levels there are matrix movie clips that help give the levels some sort of meaning but the clips seem to have been randomized
any matrix fan will feel the urge to laugh at such outofplace movie samples
the cutscenes themselves are actually better and are voiced well by soundalikes of the movies original cast
thats probably the only positive thing about the story which i never cared about from the beginningthe fighting in path of neo is difficult to appreciate despite having a lot of potential
neo has a lot of moves and being able to use them all is exciting enough to make every enemy encounter a fresh one
the environments break apart making some of the fights as epic as they were in the films
the slowmotion focus mode that was made famous by the matrix films is also a nice perk to the handtohand combat
the only problem is that new moves are constantly being discovered so for a long time each battle will be fought with similar moves and combos that become quickly repetitive
the controls dont help much as they simply dirty up the experience even more
at times id hit more than one button at a time and neo would just stand around being mauled from all sides by enemies
when the controls are functioning correctly there is a little too much buttonmashing for my taste
there is a single punch button a grapple button and a dodge button
i can promise you that youll wear them out through a lot of time with path of neonow moving away from handtohand combat and into weapon combat any sort of excitement goes away
fighting becomes a disgustingly choppy experience
with melee weapons like staves and swords neo swings his weapon as roughly as a bumpy gravel road and hitting enemies is difficult when he turns as slowly as he does
guns themselves just arent fun to use and feel very weak
the autoaim system is frustrating and broken
oftentimes after an enemy goes down the lockon cursor will stay on the dead body making neo run around staring at a corpse
of course while this is going on the camera is spinning out of control and enemies are left shooting at you
the result is nothing but confusion cheap deaths and frustrationthe presentation of path of neo is a mixed bag
the graphics are really inconsistent
sometimes the character models and environments look fantastic
the environments are destructible and the focus effects always look like a treat
other times though the textures are ugly and broken graphics blur together and the animation chugs behind a frame rate that is never consistent in the first place
the music is the typical matrix fare and the sound effects dont sound very unique or explosive
again the voice acting is probably the best part of the presentation
i must say that the pause screen is really cool as it turns everything onscreen into the neongreen matrix codingi think matrix path of neo wasted a lot of potential
it was cool to punch morpheus through the walls of a dojo in neos training
but struggling with the awful controls and trudging through the repetitive boring levels brings down the experience to a level low enough that i cant recommend buying the game
after every session i had with the game i felt myself wanting to play the game less and less
i actually think path of neo is better than enter the matrix simply because there is potential entertainment to be found here but id recommend a weekend rental at most
morpheus was wrong because neos not the onei bought the game and played it once or twice  i did not enjoy it at all
however i am also not a first person shooter gamer
i gave this game away since buying it because it was just collecting dust on my shelveshow can anyone say that this game is the game of the year
for sure they havent play resident evil this game is very very bad the camera is imposible the graphics could be much much better and the controls are just horrible dont but this game rent it first if you want to play the game of the year buy resident evil rent it firstwow im shocked on how short it was it took one hour to finish it on normal and the controls are sloppy i was getting pied off of this game but the graphics are good but it is kind of fun when you get the hang of it
im going to all the good things about itgraphics are goodsound is ok
now im going to say the worst things about thiscontrols are sloppycraptoo short no mini gamesgameplay sucks but kind of good sometimes when you just wanna play a shooterprice on it for a short game like this
there going to be bankruptmusic sucks
but the sound off guns going off is goodpretty much this game sucks no need to get it but dead to rights fans maybe like this if they have a pspgraphics  its good for a game like thissound  sound of guns going off is way better but music sucksgameplay  kind of fun sometimes when you just wanna play a shootercontrols  sucks soo sloppyoverall i think this is the lowest game i had evered reviewedthe psp version of dead to rights is a fun shootemup game that features bullet time when you press and hold the dive button the triangle button you enter slow motion time where you can pick off each target and kill them with just one shot
it takes some practice to do this as right after you enter the slow motion bullet time  it lasts just a few seconds  you have to lock each target shoot lock the next target shoot repeat
its easier said than done hampered by the stupid ingame camera which often messes up your game
the camera is insanely stupid at time which is why i give this game only  stars
its really very poorly implemented on the psp which has a small crampedfeeing control pad to start withthe other reason for the two star rating is the game is ridiculously short
just rent it from blockbuster which btw lets you keep a game or video for up to two weeks and i bet you can finish it in a day or two
multiplayer mode is pretty lame after a while too as theres little variety
the soundtrack is okay and adds to the mayhem experience
finally while at times you can command your loyal dog shadow to attack your enemy its a rather limited featureseriously the game could have been so much better
i thought after all the problems they had with the console versions the developers would finally get the gameplay right
nopeverdict do not waste your money on this one
its too short and too frustrating at times
at best a rental titlei played this game when it first came out abd i was expecting something fun and exciting
instead what i got was a walk and shoot walk and shoot type of game
thats all you do in this game
you walk crouch shoot wait for animated cutscenes and thats it
theres no creativity to this game
no challange
no nothing
this game is boring with a capital b ypull tire of this quickly and demanding your moeny back
if you do like this series though you should get it as a rental or as a used gamethe graphics arent even that good
this game was made like the developers were drunk or in a hurry
plus they decided that its a good way to make money but word of advice if the console versions flop dont attmept to recoup losses by putting the failure on to a handheld because thats just low especially when you charge  for itthis game was very disappointing
at first it sounded very promising and different
youre keith and youre stranded on an island after the cruise ship you were on has sunken
now you have to stay alive using your survival skills
theres also another person on the island skye that keith meets up with who was also on the same ship
however she is so dimwitted whiny and completely useless that she makes you want to kill her just to eat her
its bad enough to hear keith whine and complain every few seconds
eh but killing her unfortunately is not an option
afterall shes a major part of the story line blah blah blah
after youve been formally introduced keith accidently steps on her glasses and renders her completely blind apparently because shes completely incapable of moving around on her own
you than turn into her seeing eye dog and have to hold her hand constantly to move her around otherwise shell stay in one spot
this will slow down the journey considerably
along the way youll have to pick up scarcely scattered coconuts clams potatoes mushrooms etc
to eat and drink as well as sticks and twigs to build fires
but as you venture on you lose health due to running just as fast as you can feed him
before you know it youve already died  times
this is pretty frustrating especially when he cant run when his health is low and you cant get food and water to him fast enough
this pretty much comprises much of the games objective to keep the bastard alive
in other wordsboring
youll constantly have to feed keith and take time to let his lazy ass rest every  minutes
his little buddy skye is not any better and youll have to do the same for her
did i mention theres endless walking and climbing through what looks like the same patch of dead grass over and over again
yeah well youll be doing a lot of that only occasionally stopping to push a log
the stylus cant even be used to move the characters
the characters are so pixelated to the point that they look like walking squares
possibly the only redeeming aspect of this game is the tool making hunting and fishing parts which were mildly enjoyable but definitely wont make up for the lack of fun in the rest of the game
this game has no replay value
pass on this game and pick up trace memory a similar but much better title as well as a number of other much better ds titlesmy biggest beef with the game that if fixed would make it worth ten times its weight in gold would be that the virtual hours pass by in a matter of seconds
pretend its  am
if the boy walks form one tree over to another tree two feet away poof
its  am
then you go through the small cut scene where he finds the cave andpoof
its all the sudden  pm and time to go to bed but there is nowhere to sleep
other than that the gameplay is fun the minigames are awesome making tools is fun and hunting is awesome but difficult
once you get the hang of keeping them alive for several  hour days it gets a lot easier as things begin to float up on shore and other surprises
hope you can survive long enough to escape cause it almost made me pull whats left of my hair outif youve played grand theft auto youve played this game
which i guess is good if you really love gta and want to keep playing it again and again
its the same even down to the map and having a safehouse
bully was a gta ripoff too but at least it had new interesting characters and story  it would be nice if they made a godfather game in a different waythis game is miserably ok to flat out sucks
dont get me wrong i love the godfather but is nowhere near the moviewhats up with the character customization
i think its a bad ideaif you were from another race or origin rather than italianyou know don corleone will be giving you the boot
another thing is you see one building you see them all
they all look alike
mafia the game was way better and it can be purchased for like  bucks i think
official xbox magazine rates the godfather a being not the best
its not just melets hope scarface makes up for such a messcan you say repetitive
the game starts out fun
admittedly i had a great time extorting businesses for money and raiding the factories of rival families
then i came to the realization that the level design is absolutely the same for every type of building
when taking over a factory by force you can expect the same enemy pattern every single time
on the bright side the graphics arent bad
with exception to the cars the game controls great
the cars are way too slow and steering is cumbersome
rent this one
youll enjoy the first few hours then come to your senses and realize that ea is simply trying to capitalize on the popularity of the godfather licensewill theyprosnice graphicsnice superstar abilitiesdont have to purchase all jerseys since its not alotmarv and steve kerr doing comentaryonline mode is pretty coolconshorrible reboundsi mean its a miracle whenever i get a rebound offensivly or defensivly
on superstar this makes winning impossible on all star i get only  rebounds and the computers get  and when i win i win by small margines
even if i got tim duncan and nazir mohommed jumping for the ball magicly earl boykins ends up with the ball
i mean come on
clutch time stupidity ea always has this as a burden the computer can be down by  with  minutes to go then all of a sudden its all up to a final possesionrealistic to unrealisticthis game is was to silky smooth fast paced and it keeps the same style of the previous live unfortunatly the pace of  was more suited for this stylematch everythingbecause of rebounding it was like the computer would score on every possession despite i shot  and they shot 
its just an unfair advantage
if i shot that low the other team would blow the game wide opennba live  is just another ea attempt at trying to make a better nba k and they once again suck major bottie crack at doing it
this is just flat out sad
out of all nbas since the new freestyle controls i found the first one nba live  to be the best
that game was pure freestyle and more power to the people
every live after that tended to go into the computers direction and if thats so then nba live  has succeded
the only fun i have is playing against friends or online but never against the computers
so unrecamendale unless you love live to deathpeacedont get me wrong
my wife loves this game
this is the first game on the ps i can get her to playbut the graphics are just plain terrible
its difficult to see your character and distinguish himher from the background
they frequently get lost on the screen clutter
due mostly to the clunkiness of the character the controls are difficult
but the good or bad news is that because the game is so easy you can pretty much play the whole thing through in one sittingunless youre a diehard fan and must have it i wouldnt recommend this gamethe game definitely has some good things going for it  the sounds are very good the adaptation of the film and books are overall well done and some of the mini games are quite enjoyable
all of which does not make up for the most annoying part of the game the sheer mindboggling length of the levels
not length in a good way length in a enter a room beat the exact same creatures in the exact same way solve a puzzle the same manner again way
there is a line between challenging and monotonous and the game designers crossed the line a long time ago
certainly shorter levels would have literally made for a shorter game which is usually a bad thing
but nobody playing the game can help but groan when you clear one screen and go to the next that is exactly the same and then keep doing that over and overi also wish they had made more use of the touchscreen
the minigames use it and are generally well done
you also use it sometimes when battling a creature
this part is actually pretty fun and hints at the true potential of a harry potter game in which you do lots of things with the touchscreen such as emulating wand movements
unfortunately the touchscreen creature battles happen randomly and rarely and can be annoying  they take a long time for easy creatures that would have been defeated quite easily without the touch screen spellcasting mode
conversely they are quite handy when fighting some of the more tougher or annoying monsters as you can always win fairly quickly in the touchscreen modethe graphics are not quite up to par with other ds games and there are places where the controls are difficult and the characters can get stuck
the gameplay is very straightforward  make your way from point a to point b by killing monsters and unlocking puzzles mostly by levitating things around
you play as one of the three characters and the other two are with you can controlled by the game
however for the most part they are useless and only get in the way
the game would have been much better if the other two simply apparated in when you needed them for those times when a large object just happens to block your path and can only be moved by the combined power of three wandsall in all i cannot give this more than two stars as its potential is more than overweighed by the glitches the bad gameplay and the annoyingly repetitive levelswell it is a online game only and it didt say that when i bought it so it looks fun but who know
i will have to hook my online up to try it someday when i have timeplayed it on pc and i liked a lot so i decided to buy it on pc because i could not finish it the graphics seem to cel i have seen other games with excellent graphics psplet me start off by saying that nfs most wanted is arguably my favorite all time racing game
i beat the pc version and then the ps version and then the  version
so needless to say i picked it up for my psp as welllets not beat around the bush this version of most wanted is horrible
it starts off alright kind of
you might get  or  races in before encountering the cops
but once you do youll realize the downfall of this gameyou dont so much race as you get pushed around the course by the cops
theres no exaggeration in that
im only up to level  and ive spent at least  races with one or more entire laps having to try and make turns with a cop pushing me all over the placeobviously as a most wanted fan i knew going in that the cops ignored the other street racers and focused solely on you but this is ridiculous
its like someone at ea decided that despite having a near perfect game on every other platform it was in need of a makeover and that makeover was all cops all the timetheres really no saving grace for the game
its not a bad racer otherwise but its not a great racer eitherif i could recommend anything i would point you in the direction of juiced  on the psp
as far as i can tell in my couple of hours in its nearly identical to the  version
an enormous selection of cars great graphics and great contols
if youre an arcade racing fan check it out and leave most wanted for other platformswhen i was playing snk vs capcom with a group of people we decided to play this game
we were appalled by its bad gameplay
unlike great fighters like street fighter soulcalibur dead or alive and tekken this game does a poor job of being a fighter
to start off the camera angle that this game uses is a terrible angle for fighters which made it confusing to jump on things to get to an opponent
there is also a lack of combat moves so the game gets boring quickly
it has lacking graphicsive seen better on the gamecube than this the control scheme is confusing and the voice actors suck
if you want to play a fighter staring the marvel heroes go play xmen vs street fighter insteadmarvel nemesis was eas turn to cash in on the marvel superhero franchise
spiderman wolverine elektra and many others go up against the imperfects a group of geneticallyaltered superhumans
theres also some kind of thinly scripted alien invasion story involvedfirst the good
production values are spot on with stylized artwork for the menus and good voice work
the imperfects are an interesting bunch and each comes with a movie clip detailing their origin
character models are nicely sculpted although the camera is often too far away for you to noticewhere marvel nemesis fails is that its simply not much fun
this isnt marvel vs capcom its a brawlerpowerstone hybrid
that in itself isnt a bad thing but you have to work through an absolutely tedious story mode to unlock all the characters and extras
youll waste time fighting wave after wave of generic alien enemies only to reach ridiculously cheap bosses
the games biased towards the imperfects who generally have widerreaching and more damaging attacks
the ai isnt afraid to spam you with cheap shots when it gets the chance
also littered across the stages are explosive background objects like oil drums and cars that can be picked up and thrown
theyre useful but way too damaging and can easily kill you when youre close to finishing a mission
cue frustrationonce story mode is finished player mode is supposed to be where the replay value lies
only theres not much to it
not a lot of options to explore here
levels arent that interesting to play in the simple controls dont hold much depth and strategy
smash bros has strategy
this is closer to buttonmashingmarvel nemesis is a flawed game wrapped in very pretty packaging
rent if youre absolutely curious but there are better superhero titles to look intobut it is a very bad game
the story is barley thereyou pick a herovillian and fight  people
thats about it there is a little paragraph tellin you about your enemy like what heshe is doing and who they work for
the sound is decent pretty low quality but it isnt completely terrible the only saving grace is the graphics while cool it doesnt save the game and as much as i was hoping for a good game this one falls flatprosgreat graphicsconsits short but i got bored and didnt bother to finish itgameplay is too conventional and not really that innovativenot realistic one man army dumb enemy ai lots of bullets believe it or not i can do stealthy sniping with my silenced pistol
if you like fps its worth a trybut if realism matters so much dont botherthis game was worse than i expected since it was a greatest hits title
its not too bad though it could have included an in game map or radar
and also theres no blood and gore in the game
if the game was going to be a rated m game anyway  why not include blood 
its worse than those crappy rated t shooter games 
at least those are more interesting
and the story line is retarded
i have no idea how this became a greatest hits title
either it was an error or the gaming industry is going to the dogsblack is one of those games that you either like or dislike  no middle of the road
in my opinion this game has no redeeming qualities
the explosions are fun but dont even kill the enemies  of the time
the guns are impressively rendered but dont even kill the enemies  of the time  you have to unload an unreal amount of bullets into an enemy just to make them hop around on their foot
and the enemy spawn points are so illdesigned  you destroy a room completely with bullets and explosions and then an enemy comes from behind a box that survived the mayhem
all and all i really wish that i had wasted my money on some game that had a good story had interesting levels and gave me good replay value for my gaming dollar
if you want to try this game let me know and ill send you my copy
be forewarned  youll be bored before youre even halfway finishedok so i bought soul calibur  after buying and absolutely disliking soul calibur  so therefore i guess it reasons that my disappointment with this game is my own faultfirst i am going to start off with the good aspects
the game is beautifully crafted the backgrounds are absolutely magnificent the characters are beautifully developed and the graphics and frame rates are by all token beyond amazing
when the characters are fight they are flawless their moves combat and actions are seamless and there is not a skip or a frame miss between them
the backgrounds are much more developed than in sc and they even allow you to manipulate the scenery for instance if a fighter hits a wall it will break ect
next the game is filled to the hilt with tons of extras tons of mini games and you are able to buy and absolute plethora of weapons armor and items almost mirroring the final fantasy series in a great way
lastly the music isnt bad and the story line is pretty good too although it an get convoluted at times
finally i absolutely love that you can build your own character but i hate that you are relegated to the weapons and moves that the dictator computer forces on younow for the negatives which unfortunately far outweigh the positives
as amazing and as wonderful as the above aspects are they really dont make the game fun and for me a video game needs to be fun for me to enjoy it it needs to entertain me not give me rage and frustrate my like this game does
my contention with this game comes in the following areas
 the games difficulty is absolutely ridiculous and is not made with common gamers in mind
i am not serious about video games i play them to pass the time or on my train commute but this game is developed for serious gamers and this is clearly reflected in the lack of difficulty settings
no easy mode or medium for guys like me only hard for the fan boys
the ai is completely unbalanced
one stage is super easy the next one is super hard than followed by easy and so forth in a random order
this is angering when i am getting my butt handed to me in the first stage because i got stuck against a genius ai
at least with mk the game gets harder as you progress and as you get better this is completely random
also how the hell can a massive behomoth such as asteroth deal tiny amounts of damage but a little shrimpy girl like taki can deal mass amounts of damage and over whelm you
yea someone is a feminist
like in sc the computer can pull of these ridiculous moves that you can not even dream of pulling off
when you get stuck fighting against a hard ai the computer will have you bouncing in the air for  or  hits with  of your life gone before you even know what happened to you
the computer will block you every  seconds and you wont get a good hit in at all and it will pull off a counter every  seconds as is the same with breaking your grabs but you as the player can forget about any of that the probability of you timing it right is 
 who ever designed the characters clearly had favorites in mind and was by all means close to being a feminist
all of the female characters are far better than the male characters are far faster stronger more elegant and the computer works their ai much better
also when fighting mitsarugis ai he was clearly a favorite of the developers as his fighter wether it is your first or th fight is unbeatable and is insanely hard to beat
 what the hell they got rid of all of the great charatcter moves and replaced them with boring moves
for instance ivy cant swing her swordwhip around any more with the l button instead she just stabs boring on the upside taki has a good move where she stabs the ground with l so i guess the got rid of great moves and added some good ones leave the great ones and add more great ones
also some of the fighters outfits are just plain dumb i think they were better fashioned in sc
asteroth looked better in sc as did taki i hate her mask
 chronicles of the sword is so dumb childish and pointless
i hated the weapon master in sc because of its difficulty but this puts it to shame makes me love wm
 this game is all about practice
if you have the time to practice and play for  hrs a day like a good fan boy should than you will have no problem mastering the moves and combos
but if you are like me and you are getting a degree working and conducting a personal life you can forget about getting anywhere in the game
 the memory card currupts if you save another game after playing chron of the sword
this is kind of idiotic considering that i really dont feel like paying for  memory cards just to have an entire card for one game that genuinely dislikei gave this game an additional star becuase its good aspects are phenominal
unfortunately none of the good parts make the game enjoyable or fun
this game is so hard and so frustrating that you will either put it down in a minute or you will toss your controller out the window in sheer rage
if you have time to invest in practice and all that bs buy this game but dont buy into the little fan boys and girls about how great this game is
if you are like me and are a suckie  casual gamer this game is not for you if you are a great gamer go for itcasual gamers beware sc does not have us in mind
we dont existhow fun is this game
what
why does amazon ask this question
this is not a gamei dont know if this is supposed to sound this way or not but these speakers do not make it a lot louder than it is without them
maybe this is all it is supposed to do
give a very very very tiny boost
i probably would not have purchased this if i knew how low it would still be
i got this for my husband because the sound was way too low originally but i guess you just cant get a very loud sound in a compact speaker
i cant say im not disappointed though
the speakers on a chair he has that you can connect psp to are much much louder but you cant carry this chair around so i thought this theater experience would be perfect for him but it is far from theaterlike sound in any way and he still has to get really close to hear it decent oh well you live and you learnthe portability and the case that holds psp is great but if the speakers are no good then there really is no pointmoh series has fallen on its face with the past two entries
rising sun sucked and so does european assault
ill give that this one is better than rising sun but thats not saying anything
the gameplay is simple and bland
the ai
is retarded
boring missions and your sqaud is a useless feature
the moh series needs a serious boost if it wants to ever have success againthis is just a rushed game plain and simple
this feels like a game that would have been a good starting point but not a game in the later part of a console cycle with a great pedigree as medal of honor
the bargain price and lack of advertisement sort of confirms the amount of effort used to produce the gamethe first thing that shocked me was no midmission saving or checkpoints
huh
did i suddenly get transported to the mid nineties
if so remind me to buy some stock and housing
you die in the end of an hour long mission you start the hour long mission from the very beginning
the only reason any game would not have constant saves is to mask the lack of playable levels by making the gamer repeat stuff over and over again
and yes that is the case here
whats really shameful is that the previous game in this series actually did have saves
i was near the end of the last level about to complete the game when i died by a surprise rush of people
i am not going to waste another  minutes of my life to work on five minutes of gamingthe other things that this game lacked that the previous game rising sun had is online and coop play
there is a multiplayer but there are no robots
so unless you have a multitap its one on one
that is not much of a multiplayer at allthere only  levels total
the first  are really just half the length of the latter   the look of the levels are usually dreary and monocolor at best brown for the desert levels white for the last  snow levels and are just really dull
all in all if you played all levels well and never had to repeat any part of a level youd have a grand total of about  hours of game play
making this a rental if you really want to play thisother problems also exist in the game play
the first is that for some reason after killing a person ammo will appear but disappear really soon
this leaves the player with a dilemma run to the ammo and die in the open or really have no ammo and be a sitting duck
the squad that you control is a laughable joke
the ai that controls it is terrible
you will be hiding pinned down and your three squad mates will run around like headless chickens right in front of machine gun fire
complete idiots
also there are other bad aspects like the introducing a cliched boss
dont get me started on the tedium of grenade throwing
random times the aiming just would not work
up close shooting is terrible
many times enemies will sometimes shrug off direct hits
i could go on and onthere are some good points though
levels    are actually pretty playable  well designed and somewhat fun
the sound is amazing
the game mechanics are spot on
individually the controls reward cautious thoughtful game play
given a few more months of development and fine tuning a great game could have been produced
the game engine is thereprosgood general playing mechanicsgood soundgood engineconsno save at any point of the missionno coopno onlinehorrible squad matesnot many missionsdisappearing ammoslack of ammomonochrome like levelsbad aimingbosses whyhours to complete   hoursfrustration level on normal  highdifficulty on normal  mediumhighi was really disappointed in this game
for one your squad members never listed to you when you issued a command and they ran around where they pleased
there were hardly any check points in the game and especially in the last level where you played for over a half hour and at the very end if you arent on the ball and get killed you have to start over again
i like the first medal of honor and i know there  a lack of check points there but captures what wwii may have been like
i see that there is a new medal coming out called vanguard and hesitant about trying it but willthe nintendo ds as innovative as it is just cant do a few things correctly
it isnt a very good floatation device
it wont get you to the moon
it also cant handle a firstperson shooter
this is very evident in electronic arts port of goldeneye rogue agent
rogue agent is so heavily flawed in some aspects that it makes it difficult to enjoy the game at allthe story of rogue agent ds is pretty much a pointless addon to a generic and clunky firstperson shooter
basically as a rogue mi agent your goal is to assist goldfinger in his pursuit against dr no and his evil henchmen
the gameplay itself is mauled by a horrible control scheme which is utterly painful in execution and jumbles up any sort of entertainment that could be foundthe only real way to control the game is with the strapandthumb piece that came packaged with the nintendo ds
this wouldnt be such a big problem if it just felt a little less awkward
i practically had to do finger warmups in order to stretch them out far enough to hit the shoulder buttons while i was using the thumb piece and directional pad
the small  and inconveniently placed  goldeneye powerup icons dont help one bit eitherthe gameplay isnt only hampered by the control scheme
the single player missions are limited in number and are void of any entertainment whatsoever
it seems that there are only four or five different enemy skins throughout the game so i found myself blasting away at the same dull baddies that never really posed a threat
in fact the only time i died was near the end of the game when some of the enemies carried singleshotkill weapons
this was made more frustrating by the lack of checkpoints in each level meaning that i would usually run through the same boring hallways and rooms only to die in the same spotfortunately rogue agent ds carries a slightly stronger point in its graphics
they dont look like theyre from the nintendo  era like many other ds games
the corridors are a little bland in some spots but overall the game looks nice and runs at a very constant speed
i found it a little odd that enemy characters dont react to bullets they sit and suck them in like human shields
rogue agent ds has taught me that in the future nameless grunts are really walls in disguise that or kevlar has gone a really long wayi wish i could give the same praise to the music and sound effects but the effects themselves are very bland typical shooter stuff that has probably been recycled a few times
the music is so bad that its almost a good thing
anytime i ever have an annoying song stuck in my head ill sleep well knowing that rogue agent ds sounds much worse in every wayin conclusion a decent multiplayer mode doesnt save a broken game
goldeneye rogue agent on the nintendo ds is the first shooter on the console and if theyre all going to feel and play like this id like it to be the last
unless youre a real sucker like some sort of ultra dumdum sucker for wireless multiplayer shooting youre not missing anything in this gameit is often the case that reviews criticize games for not being what the reviewer really wanted why couldnt there be more of this or less of that
type of reviews  that is unfair
however this game is severely flawed mostly because of issues with the setup and execution of the game
the missions in and of themselves are interesting enough to make for good game play
i especially liked the russian missions as it seems that the russian world war ii experience is largely lacking in video games
but overall this game has a rushed feel to it as if the developers were hurried along to compete with other games like brothers in armsfor example there is no easy way to save your progress
you are given varying numbers of revives during a given mission but you cant easily quit in the middle of one without losing all of your progress
so if you are killed within a long campaign you are forced to start all over again
likewise the squad based component is preschoolesque when compared to that of brothers in arms and your squad often gets in your way during heated battles or stands by next to an enemy that kills you
finally the multiplayer aspect has no cooperative level and is really no great improvement on previous multiplayer parts of first person shootersthis game makes for an interesting afternoon but doesnt really have the umph
to make it worthy of repeated playill make it short
the gamespot reviewer said destroy all humans wasnt good for its gameplay and he was right
the idea of say abducting someone and sucking out their brain is really cool but in execution its just boring
the game does have a great sense of humor thoughafter this game drop in price i decided it was about time to buy it
big mistake
at first the game seems very fun and interesting
youre an alien sent to earth toyou guessed it destroy humans
during the killing you harvest dna which you can trade in for upgrades on your personal abilities weapons and flying saucer
however these upgrades dont translate into new different weapons
they just mean more powerful existing weapons which is kinda lame
and at first these upgrades are inexpensive and easy to comeby
then the upgrades become expensive and taxing on your dna budget
so you have to do tedious mundane harvesting to get these upgrades which in upper levels are almost needed to destroy enemies and accomplish your objectives
and while were talking about enemies the ones in this game never stop coming
apparently the government is involved in some cloning because the just keep coming over and over and over and over and you see where im going with this
the game is entertaining it just doesnt last that long
fighting battles in your saucer is also difficult due to this
rocket launchers and antiaircraft installments just keep on coming back too pounding the living crap outta you
and health and ammo recharges arent the easiest things to come by
the sandbox setup you can run around and do whatever is kinda nice but with so few weapons  and mental abilities  things get boring very quickly
i wouldnt recommend buying it or renting it for that matter but if your curiosity overwhelms you like mine did rent iti rented this and ended up just watching and not playing
the controls for this game are all backwards  press forward to see backwardetc
which is kind of the reason i threw the remote in frusteration
it wasnt entertaining me enough to warrant my attention
picking up and throwing cows to start with
that is beyond stupid
wasnt the name destroy all humans
whateverwhen youre not being dizzy you do get to do some fun things in the perky s era world
throwing humans reading their minds occasionally hypnotizing them zapping them
be ready for the flame gun
much time is spent extracting brain stems as well as going on missions
thats where it reminds me a bit of grand theft auto  and vice chase people to find others turn into a human and read thoughts to stay human  it runs out fast
fly onto houses and buildings to cool down your wanted radarjust be careful you dont take your eyes off your health and get trapped
dead its a coverup and you have to start all the way from the beginnning of the level
not hard but annoying
also the aliens are beyond ugly greygreen little monsters so youre always being screamed at and shot at
better than the latest gta but killer camera and a lot of stupidity
perfect for younger males and the little rampaging boy at heartme
im waiting for jawsto start my consol is the ps gig that plays ps games
maybe a true ps consol would allow game saves part way into a missionbut on my ps consol such is not the case
you can be an inch away from completing a mission and get jumped by a dozen meninblack types only to die and have to restart the mission from the very beginingvery frustrating
the verbal dialog in the game is entertaining but paused as if the voice overs were being read for the first time
the game starts out being rather ammusing but loses its charm after only a couple missions
a number of missions require you to disguise your alien to look human but if a man in black gets too close your cover is blownand guess what there can be dozens of these men in black running all over as if they were walmart clerksinwalmart
i am lucky that i only dished out  bucks for a used title
my compliments to the vendorthe game arrived scratch free and completely usablewhat starts off as a fun amusing game eventually turns into a typical checkpoint type save disaster
as opposed to using creativity to add challenge to the game the designers decided to use repetition instead
although it is not true checkpoints as such but rather you simply cannot save a mission until you complete multiple objectives
at first this is not a problem but towards the middle of the game you suddenly find yourself trying to do the same thing over and over again
perhaps if you have the memory of a three year old  you may find this to be exciting and fun
however if you have anything more upstairs you will quicky tire of this waste of your time
it wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt such a large amount of time that you are sometimes set back
you may finally complete two objectives and be working on your third when you get killed and have to start over from the very beginning
this is not creative
this is not challenging
this is simply repetition
its a shame too because this game could have been a lot of funi loved the arcade version and the saturn version of the nd vf
the original was a break through in graphics introducing d models generated by a computer
however that is all this game has to offer pretty much the graphics are really outdated and arent colorful like they are in old school street fighter and streets of rage games
the game play is the biggest down fall by fari dont like this game chiefly because the music sucks
on top of that the story is not very dynamic
i hate slow movements and boring conversationsromancing saga is a mediocre rpg with bad graphics that attempt to be artistic combined with obscure objectives and long boring dialogsthe combat system is pretty standard fare as far as console rpgs go
it is turn based and starts you out with a good variety of options as far as what commands you can execute in combat
the music while uninspired ranges from atrocious to something that sounds like aerobiz for the sega genesisif you have a friend who will let you play at his house or let you borrow it for a while and you are a fan of rpgs in general you may find a little amusement out of this game
otherwise i would not recommend wasting your time as there are plenty of better rpgs out theremany people had told me how wonderful this game was
i had been told that it was what would happen if squareenix had made the suikoden games
to put it mildly i was foaming at the mouth to get my hands on this gametwentynine hours later im left wondering whythe main plot even with the major fork near the end is pitifully short and it can be completed in twentyodd hours
no matter how much time you put into levelling up your party members their skill sets will never get better
you arent allowed to upgrade your party members equipment
other than having other people to act as targets there really isnt much use for the people you recruit
when the game is touted as having an involving storyline with an emphasis on recruiting friends to help i just cant help but think that the experience is incredibly lackingcertainly the graphics are pleasant they have a very nice almost watercolor look to them and the music is decent but thats not really enough to hang a game onperhaps if i hadnt heard any of the hype or the favorable comparisons to suikoden which is one of my favorite rpg franchises and a much better alternative to this tripe i mightve enjoyed myself
but as it is im just glad i bought a used copyradiata stories is very much like a childs version of star ocean  it has hardly any mature moments and lots of unfunny goofy behaviour and jokes
ill list whats bad and goodwhats goodgood graphics with prog scan and widescreen support this is very pleasing the character models are nice as wella lively atmosphere people go about their daily business and it seems very real everyone isnt just standing around waiting for you to talk to them like most rpgs
also armour that you buy actually appears on your character ingamecombat with  other allies is decent if unspectacular real time combat is always nice and gives you a feeling of being part of a team optional boss iseria queen looks even more beautiful in this game than the othersa surprise character joins you in the postgame dungeonvery pleasing to see her againwhats not so goodthis is a very light hearted adventure that has you fighting rats ants animals and hardly any spectacular enemies at all
boringa very linear adventure the sidequests are dull and recruiting   people can drag at timesthe main character minces power walks when you push the analogue stick moderately hard it looks awfuly stupiddreadful ending over in less than a minute or two  very dullonly one extra dungeon thats very short and pretty easyi strugled to get past the  hour mark it becomes very predictable and you forget it as soon as you stop playingallies can never be equipped or have any stat changed this is a single hero gamevery few weapons and armour to collectrigged fights that you cannot win even if you are very powerful
you actually have to stand there and get beatenfar too easy wheres the difficulty settings like sonot worth the full price maybe pick it up when it goes cheapi tried playing this game twice and both times i got to a point where it was more of a chore than a fun experiencetwo things greatly contributed to this  first the real time clock
you cant do events unless the clock is exactly at the right time
for a supposedly nonlinear rpg i found this frustrating and extremely linear
plus there is not an easy teleportationmovement system
if you are in one part of town it may take you  minutes just to walk to another part of townsecond is the combat system
it is incredibly easy to master each weapon just by repeatedly spamming it in random encounters
i wasnt challenged by the ultraeasy combat at all to such a point where i didnt even need the hundreds of ingame friends to help me fight
so recruiting people for me was both tedious and pointless especially because there is no fast forward for long spoken voice acting dialoguefinally the graphics seemed blocky though the music was fine
compared to the beautiful and smooth faces of final fantasy x this title by the same company had inferior figure animation
felt like bad claymation
i know square can do better but they didntif like me you are over  dont buy the game
the story is too kiddie orientated and the game play is tedious when it is not amazingly easyive played dq games before and many other rpgs
and this game advances so slowly
but then there are a million things to do if thats what you wantto be more specific  level ups are slow in higher levels and you get to the point where you have to beat bosses to advance because the regular monsters arent worth enough
theres no fast track to the end of the story line and the side quests are a neccessary part of building upthen theres the alchemy pot
nice idea
nice way to get new items
but you end up stopping constantly to reload the pot
or to figure out what you can makealso when exploring you do get attacked a little too ofteni played this  hours and got what looks like about half to rds through and couldnt sit through it any more
played the other popular new game over  hours and completed the entire story line and many side questsoh what a difference a graphical upgrade can make
the last dragon quest game to make it to america it was all but ignored because of its far behindethecurve d graphics and outdated gameplay
dragon quest viii journey of the cursed king has the same tired nes style gameplay people were complaining about last time but its wrapped up in shiny technically polished package so everyone is tripping over themselves to praise this oldschool gaming goodness
i have to concur with the guy who said dragon quest viii is everything we hated about old school but i have to add its everything we hate about newschool rpgsthe story of dragon quest is a mess of cliches and poor character development
it begins in middle with the hero the titular cursed king and yangus a bandit tracking down an insane jester
said insane jester has a very evil agenda
from there you discover what he did and what he plans to do
if youve ever played an rpg before you should know how it goes
what i really dislike about the story is that so little time is spent on stuff relating to the main plot
everywhere you go you have to do worthless quests for npcs to advance
and that means that the npcs history and problems will be conveyed to you through cutscenes so many cutscenes
in general i like the extra cinematic flair cutscenes can bring to a game but dragon quest doesnt seem to clue into the fact that its story is not that great from the beginningthe battles the meat and potatoes of an rpg represents why i never liked dragon quest back in the nes days and why i dont like it now
as people have mentioned dragon quest is stingy
it makes you work hard for everything gold experience points stat increased at level up
dragon quest isnt so much difficult as it is a time sink
you have to devote many hours to the task of leveling up a task that becomes more and more timeconsuming the deeper you get into the game
that isnt to say there is no fun to had in this game its just that this shallow game play gets really old really fast somewhere after the  hour mark
i say shallow because the game requires no strategy at all
its a strictly menu based battle system that is very limited in the number of skills you are allowed to have
surviving the various lengthy dungeons is similar to an endurance test
its just a matter of being at the proper level and not wasting your resources until you get to the enddragon quest is undeniably a great looking great sounding game but i imagine that the graphical upgrade and the squareenix name is what is garnering all this near universal praise
i imagine this will be one of those blockbuster titles that has everyone swinging from chandeliers at first but after a year or two it will become really cool to criticize
i just love to be a trend setteri have bad news and worse news the bad is that if you played kingdom hearts i you will absolutely hate kingdom hearts   the game play is nonexsistant the story line is at the st grade level and everything they did right in the first game is now gone
the worse news is that the only way one would enjoy this game is if they had never played kh
but if you never played kh you will never understand kheven at its st grade level
you have to give squareenix credit in order to mess up the final fantasy franchise they are responsible for the horrible ffx as well this bad they really had to work hard
i am sorry to say that i am afraid that ffx is the last we will ever see of the ff world
but to pull some good news out of all of this if you like a  hour disney commercial then this is the game for you
in several worlds you play the exact storyline of many of the disney movies
there is no doubt what is coming next in the gameand for some that might be a good thingfirst i was under the impression that this game must be great because it is highly rated
then i found out that it is so over rated
i think the conversations in this games are so boring
the characters are so very not original
i dont like the idea of doing errands to make munny
so much like a real world
i am all for the surreal and over the top kinda gamesthough its a very pretty game kingdom hearts ii fell pretty flat for me in comparison to the first titlepros graphics were fun to look at though the combat was mostly button mashing there were improved aspects to it like the special drive forms where sora can use two keyblades and limits which provided you with a short period of being able to use a special ability or move
call me a fangirl but i also really enjoyed being able to race light cycles in trons worldcons youre railroaded through short boring worlds on what seems more like one long movie than a game
the maps are miniscule theres no exploring no hidden ledges with goodies nothing like that at all
i was frustrated that high jump was not available until id earned it through using one of the special forms
i kept telling myself that maybe once i had high jump id be able to go back and reach some places i couldnt  before
maybe id find something interesting
but nooo im not sure what the point of being able to jump any higher was
what a waste of time
the game provides you with plenty of places that look as though they should be reachable but even when you should be able to get there you just slide back down to the ground because the programmers didnt bother to make the surface usablethis seems to be a theme in most of the game enjoy looking at the pretty environments but dont expect to interact with them in any waythe final two major complaints i have are the series of interminable final boss battles and the existence of atlanticaatlantica does this make any sense
the universe is in peril
only we can save it
oh waityou want me to waste time performing in your ridiculous undersea musical extravaganza instead of saving innocent people and defeating evil
sure
there is not anything to defeat in atlantica
i do not know why it was included in the game
i loathed it in the first one and i gnashed my teeth even more in the second because i had no reason to be theregood games force you to work and the fun is in the rewards they dole out
challenge then rewardi didnt feel rewarded in kingdom hearts ii
i just felt kind of  gyppedwhenever someone does something inventive and inspiring buy that dont buy its sequel
the sequel is a rehash of the first at best and at worst the creator either hadnt the energy to do something creative and just threw together a standard knockoff
note such sequels as alundra  suikoden what is it now four or five
 wild arms etc
sure the original was great at one time but unless you find one that broke the mold or the story is so interesting and developed that it continues through several games from what i read of kingdom hearts in plot spoilers its not quite that developed its not really worth itthe only instances where a sequel outperformed an original is where it managed to be more creative than the first such as legend of mana using nonlinear plot sequences and a learning system of battle before the sd sort of went in this direction with its choice of party altering the story or the final fantasy series which despite the reputation for being streamlined each final fantasy is an experiment with a new battle systemno i havent bought kh but after hearing the other reviews i can safely say that if i were to buy a kingdom hearts it would be kingdom hearts let me say first that upon seeing nightlife advertised i had no interest in it whatsoever
however the expansion was given to me so i gave it a whirl
unsuprisingly it is exactly how i expected it to be just oka longtime sims fanatac i own the first sims and all of its expansions ive been a bit disapointed with the sims  in general
sure the graphics are stellar but the load times are ridiculous for your average gamer
unless your pc is seriously tricked out you will have to spend a looooong time waiting
furthermore sims  failed to revolutionize the original sims all it really did was improve the graphics and alow the sims to age
which takes waaay to long as wellbut i digress
back to nightlife
the game doesnt add anything really cool or interesting to the game
some of the objectsbuilding accessories are kinda fun and it adds a number of new skins suprisingly no special pajamas
regardless the main draw for the game is missing  the downtown is nothing the sims gamer is new to and frankly its kinda gotten old boring  tired
the cars are cool but a bit overhyped
for some reason a husband and wife cant share a car and its very difficult if not impossible to fit two driveways onto one small or medium sized lot not to mention expensive
the blind date thing is ok but not a really significant add on
overall its just oki own the first two socom games i love them too despite the mild glitches and such
this game is alot like the first two but with changes to the engine most of them are positive changes making the game very enjoyable such as graphics and controls
on the other hand these positives are heavily overwhelmed by the oversights poor testing and shoddy programming destroying the enjoyability of the game
the worst change is that your fireteam is the most retarded and blind group in any game everin the early installments of socom your team was picking the enemy off at great distances before you even saw them
well in this installment often times i found a teammate getting shot by an enemy in the open and not returning fire and this is when they werent getting lost or stuck in the environment
i quickly found myself carrying the team and babysitting them not a very fun thing to do when trying to be an elite team of heroesenemies just seem to appear out of nowhere at times and they dont seem to die
how many  calibur rounds can a malnurished asian guy take
so while your trying to put a super human weighing in at  pounds your team isnt even helping you theyre most likely stuck on a post at the other side of a bridge while charley pumps him full of rounds that work much better than your own
some of the encounters with the enemy are scripted so they dont come from off map they just appear from around a water line a hut or out of thin air
very frustrating since your once amazing and well trained team are now blindfolded and stoned and firing blanksi never got into the multiplayer portion of the game i never actually bother with it on any game but the single player potion of the game is aweful
it really could have been great it could have been a fun and unique experience but sadly it was plagued by so many problems that it really came off as a third rate game slapped together and thrown down our gullets to try to appease the demand and create dollar signs
the socom game has always been sprinkled with glitches and programming issues but this time its wayyy worse and it really kills the experience i cant recommend it at allive been a huge fan of the lunar series since the sega cd days and i cant tell you how much i was looking forward to this gamebut whether you are a lunar fan or not this game is awfulnow i dont normally review games i havent finish but i am about at the halfway mark and i doubt ill ever finish this game
i am just fed up with forcing myself to play itthe story compared to other lunar games and rpgs in general is thin and boring
halfway through the game and nothing interesting has happened at all
ive traveled to some towns fought some monsters and well thats about the entire story so far
once my party entered town and my main character decided to undertake an arena battle that was extremely dangerous and foolish because he had to
he never explained why and he never talked about it before but he just had to do it
thats about how the story works  no character motivations no real backstory and no real purpose for anything that has happened so far
if they explain later in the story it will be too late because the game story is far too random and pointless for you to want to find outthe combat though is where they totally destroyed this gamefirstly the game is slow
painfully i cant take it anymore slow
the runnining speed of the characters on the map is about as fast as characters normally move in other games
the walking speed is unbearable
too bad for some reason your hp continually depleats when you run around
and you dont get much hp to begin with let me tell youbattle speed and animation is awful as well
you can hold down r constantly to speed battle up to a less slow motion feelrandom battles are eliminated which is a good thing because you can see the monsters roaming on the screen
but these battles are slow and extremely boring
and you will need to do a lot of themyou are unable to target specific enemies any longer
i have no idea why they went with this
if there are four enemies on screen my characters will spread their damage around to all of them instead of focusing on one
you will get wiped out by a magic user that can kill you in  hits while all your characters focus on killing insignificant  points of damage dealing enemies
very sloppyalso as the final nail in the coffin they introduced two forms of combat that you switch between on the main map
in one you will receive experience and in the other you will receive items and enemy cards
why they would split this up making you fight more than twice the amount of boring battles is never clear and made me pretty much hate this gameyou see the only way to make money in this game and armorweapons and healing items are very expensive is by taking missions from the courier you work for
basically bring this person x number of y items
some items are really easy to get and will get you almost no money and some people want items that are absolutely crazy to get
 of an item that is dropped by one enemy maybe  time out of so you will be spending hours killing enemies over and over again trying to get your mission items and gaining no experiencethis is completely unexcusablethe game is by no means easy either
all the little issues random attacks very very low mp weak starting characters can make this game very challenging
which would be no problem except everything is this game is so unfun and unbalanced that the difficulty is just one more huge thing stacked between you and having any fun at alloh and for some reason you have to blow into the mic to run from battles
which when youre looking for one item from one enemy you want to do a lot
not only made me a little dizzy it rarely was successful and then you lose a turni was very very letdown by this game and im sad they used the lunar world and name for a game that is this badthe only good things are that the game does look good
the enemies and characters usually look nice and theres a decent amount of varietythere is no real need to use the touch screen either and the two screens are usually combined to make one big picture  this is broken in the middle and leaves things heads on a totally different screen but that really doesnt make the game any worse
it probably couldntim a big fan of lunar
i loved lunar silver star story complete and i loved eternal blue
hey i even picked up lunar legend on the gba but this gamethe first original lunar game to come out in ten yearsseverely disappoints me by missing what makes lunar so enticing in the first place
this to me does not feel like a lunar game but rather an rpg trying to be lunaranyone who has played lunar knows that althena created the world of lunar
in dragon song there are two races the humans and beastmen
humans are trained more in the arts of healing while most beastmen are warriors
theres a powerstruggle between the two one group thinks theyre better than the others
but when the vile tribe threatens the world the two races are able to put their differences aside and work together to stop themgameplay in lunar is simple but it has changed
for one all dialogue actions take place on the touch screen
the problem being that nothing happens on the top screen
you wouldnt think this to be a big problem but when youre used to playing rpgs on the console youre not used to having to look at a bottom scream for messages and a top screen for gameplay
there were better ways to utilize the touch screen in this game
likewise the menu is not very well crafted and its difficult to use upon first playing the gameand as if the gameplay on the field werent enough
in battle is terrible
when one decides to battle one must keep in mind what battle mode they are in
combat mode and virtue mode
the difference is simplein combat mode you will defeat enemies for prizes
glorious items that youll sometimes need on your quest
some youll need to progress
the downside to combat mode is your characters get no experience
thats a shamevirtue mode is just about the opposite of combat mode
you get experience but you get no items
however the other part about virtue mode is after each battle a clock starts ticking down
when it reaches zero all the enemies in that particular area will respawni honestly couldnt figure out why the developers made two combat modes
in all other rpgs they seem to intertwine getting experience points and items together really well
in other words the unique twist in battling is a wasteand thats not even the worst part of the battle system
battling is boring
you can either use special moves attack or use an item
it doesnt matter what battle mode youre in each battle plays out the same way
you cant choose who you want to attack however
your characters attack at random and the enemies on the top screen cant be reached by your characters
this takes the fun out of battling and leaves you with doing nothing but holding down the a button
battles with say seven enemies take a long time and they do a fairly large amount of damageeven outside of battle has its quirks
in order to execute battle you must touch an enemy
ok i can deal with that
what i cant deal with however is the running part
if you hold down the button to run and you run for too long your hp begins to dropyou also only get three characters in battle at a time which in and of itself is a crime to lunar in which they usually produce a challenge and let you use all five characters in battle
and you cant switch characters either
the three the game gives you are the three you get
like the early days useless characters just leave the party and come back whenevercards are also used in this game
some enemies turn into cards
you can play that card in battle to do things such as enhance your strength poison other enemies and more
and you can run from battle by blowing into the microphone but chances of you actually escaping are rarehowever there are two positives to this game but unfortunately because of the big hit it takes with gameplay its positives arent enough to save it
the graphics are stunning
incredibly bright and colorful and full of warmth
the character sprites and animations are also a beauty to behold
it works on so many different levels
the music is also good giving the game a good feel at leastdespite the graphics and sound you cant shake the fact that the game is just boring and lacks creativity
battling is limited to you doing nothing more than holding down the a button and im not too keen on my hp dropping simply because i decided i wanted to run through an area instead of walkingeven lunar fans will have a hard time getting into this game
the story doesnt pick up for hours and even when it does its nothing compared to the two games before ittheres no real way to say this other than this game is not for anyone
even the diehard lunar fan will have trouble getting into it
even the hardcore rpger will have a hard time getting into it
there are better games to spend your money on
but spending your money on this is like throwing it into a paper shredderi rue the day i asked for lunar dragon song for christmas
i rue putting it in the ds and turning it on
i rue the fact that once i start a game i am bound to complete itmost of all i rue the fact that this game is so bad
and it could have been good
it should have been goodi think the biggest problem is that they tried to add a lot of weird game mechanics and wound up adding too many bad onesbut for whatever reason lunar ds is a nuisance to playstory standard
boy meets girl
girl and boy hang out
girl gets kidnapped by evil monsters
boy teams up withumtwo other girls to save her
some other characters fade in and out and it gets a bit annoying when you dont know when someone will suddenly vanish and take your valuable accessory with themthose who are expecting the other lunar games heartfilled characters and spirited dialogue are going to be disappointed
and dont give me that you cant compare handheld to the console garbage
maybe not in terms of graphics or sound but its more than possible to make loveable characters and witty dialogue on a handheld
the golden sun games are proof enough of thatgraphics decent
some of the character designs are pretty cool particularly the dragons
oh if they had messed up the dragons this review would be even more scathing
theres some pixelation in the combat screens but nothing really istractingsound not bad
theres a lot of praise for the sound and its really not undeservedgameplay ewwwwww
too many novelties spoil everything
let me explain youve got a pretty basic rpg system to start with
you wander around the overworld until you hit a monster then go to a turnbased battle screen
this is where things first go wrong
the battle systems biggest flaw you cant choose which enemy to attack
ever
its just randomly selected
i have no idea what purpose this is supposed to serve but its extremely annoying and makes strategizing your moves all but impossible
its doubly irritating when you consider that certain enemies can steal and break your items and no you cant get them back
replacement is possible but irritating and so youd want to kill them before they have the chancealso that whole turn dark enemies to light thing
lies
what theyre actually talking about is nothing more than gaining experience called althena conduct but exp by any other name its something to do with the two combat modessee youve got one mode called um combat mode
after a battle you gain no experience but you might get items
useless items that you have to go on irritating delivery quests to make money off of but i digress
the other mode is virtue mode in which you get no items but do gain experience
the story explanation is that youre converting the enemies or something but that has no actual effect on the gamethe stupid delivery quests are the only way to make any significant amount of moneyyou can only take one at a time and it involves a lot of tedious running around and remembering where people are
oh and running drains hp
annoyancetheres a card collection system which is actually fairly cool because most enemy cards can be used in battle for some effect like healing or stat boost and they can be used multiple times
the bad thing
getting a card is not guaranteed even for oneofakind enemies
and i sir am a collectionist
that means i feel a deep inner need to collect everything possible in a given game such as cards
i did it in lunar legend
i did it in baten kaitos
my patience in these matters shocks and amazes my friends
but im not going to do it for dragon song
at least not for several yearsalso there are several times during the game in which you have to pass through three or four dungeons in immediate succession with no access to althena statues this games equivalent of inns provide total healing
the powerful cards offset this a bit but some of us like to be a little conservative with our cards pleaseto be fair i must admit that something in the game kept me playing all the way to the highly disappointing confusing and anticlimactic endmetaphorladen verdict when you think lunar ds picture a standard rpg maybe just a little above average
now add a really weird dual battle system in which you can get either items or experience but not both
now add ridiculous fetch quests
now add a card collection system that doesnt always give you the cards from onetime enemies
now add the fact that your weapons and items can be broken or stolen at any time with no way to retrieve them though replacement is  sometimes  possible
what you have now is a twisted misshapen mass barely recognizable as a game its eyes glistening with unbearable pain from the burden of these unaskedfor grafts
no theres nothing you can do for him travis but put a bullet through his headwe need to send a message to gamearts that this kind of atrocity is not acceptable
even if it werent a disgrace to a popular welldone series which it is it would still be a bad game in its own right and there are more than enough of those out there to be getting on with thank youi really wanted to like this game
it looks gorgeous and the plotline intrigued me right from the start
where did it go wrong
was it the fact that the puzzles were so obvious that they functioned as merely timekillers
was it the fact that most of the touchpad interaction seemed taggedon and ultimately useless
was it that the plot turned out to be predictable and cliched
was it that the game was so linear that i couldnt have gotten lost if i triedmaybe it was all of the abovesighwhat can i say about this game trace memory
wellthis is not your average ds game
for one there is absolutelyno killing on your part which is good
this is a very casualgame
this game is meant to be played in your free time on thetrain to work in my case on your break but do not expect anyaction or draw dropping suspense
this is a casual gamewhich is not bad
in fact if youre tired of the games out withall their fancy graphics and complicated physics and highreflexrequirements then this game is a breath of fresh air
reallynow that said i actually liked this game sort of
i should sayi didnt pay for it if i had i would be very angry at mypurchase like i was with kingdom hearts
in this youre a year old girl ashley visiting blood edward island  nice namehuh thats just to grab you to see her long lost father
alongthe way you encounter the ghost of a boy who died on the island years ago
she gets a device to help her along the way savegames and item collecting that looks exactly like the nintendods called a dts for dual trace system original huh
and uses cards that look exactly like the dss game cards called dts cards hph
the thing i didnt like about this gamewere its expectations
your lead to believe that the ghost boyis somehow interwoven into the overall plot more on that later that the things you learn about the island and its previousoccupants are relevant
theyre not
trust methey serve as a side story to distract you from the game itselfwhich is rather boring
because  of the game takes place in amansion that for some reason unlike other mansions only has one story floor
not only that but the floor plan is juststupidallow me to explainthe foyer is the main area where you start out in this mansionyou actually start the game by leaving the boat andexploring through the island before getting to the mansionbeyond that are the bedrooms for the two main sidestorycharacters henry  leonard edwards along with the butlersroom
but thats not the stupid part
it begins with the gametaking a cue from resident evil and forcing you to go back andforth to each room to find little items to unlock secret doorsand open locked drawers and stuff to find more items
in orderto open the doors to each bedroom ashley has to find hidden keysstashed in the statue in the foyer for one bedroom and thekey to other bedroom is hidden in the butlers room 
allthe while you pick up dts cards with messages from your dadwhich turns it into a cruel goose chasei know you came to look for me in this room i cant wait tosee youand then later hey ashley
im glad you came to this room tofind me but ill be waiting for you in another room deeperinside the mansionthen later hi ashley i miss you so much yeah it showsthats why im not in this room but in the lab at very back ofthe mansion
cant wait to see you
what kind of father has his daughter going from room to room insearch of him on her th birthday
although it seems cute butits not especially since in order for her to get to him shehas to unlock all the secret doors that he locked behind him whereas said keys are hidden in cryptic puzzles like reflectivemirrors music boxes magic bookcases
which brings us back tostupid part  why are there so many locked secret doors withstrange locks involving little drummers books and turn of thecentury technologywhy would anybody build a mansion like this
why build one wherehenrys daughters room is hidden behind a secret door behind abookcase in the piano room
this secret bookcase door turnsinto a hallway where the frannies room is located is also whereone gets to an artist studio and other rooms  but wait at theend this hall way is a strange curvature that looks like adoorway with candelabras on each side which guess what opensanother secret doorway
whats behind this hidden doorway thedining room
why is the dining room hidden behind a doorwaybeyond this is another hallway with access to the kitchenlibrary and more rooms with secretsso youre probably asking whats this game about and what doesthe ghost boy have to with it nothing
in fact the ghost boysstory has nothing to do with the plot at all its just adistraction
in fact this distraction is woven into the gameplay
because as you progress through this mansion you uncovertidbits about the edwards family historical information thatyou are forced to pay attention to because at end of eachchapter there is a quiz which asks questions related to theedwards family history which has nothing to do with ashley andher father
but you are lead to believe that uncovering theedwards family secrets will uncover the secrets to the ghostboys death  but guess what
i finished the game and no
ghost boy finds out his name is daniel and that leonard was hisfather
during the ghost boy side story you pick up one of hisshoes in a cellar hidden the liberty and later towards the endof the game you find his other shoe in the cave
are you givenany explanation as to what this means no
daniel the ghost boydoesnt get his memory back and you are left just wondering whyeven have this secondary character was in the game at all whenthe game could have done fine without him
sad since his storyseems to be the most interesting except having to read all theletters and notes left by his grandfatherthe game does make use of every possible ds interactive featurebut dont think youll figure them out yourself
heres a hintfor you gamefaqs
yeah without that treasure you will notsolve at least three of the puzzles
one involved closing the ds good luck figuring that out on your own
the other involvesblowing on the mic and others have a lot of scratching on thetouch screen  better have screen protectors in placewhile this game is good for the very casual gamer unfortunatelyit doesnt offer much in the way of game play and the story hasso many possibilities but falls do short of being intriguingespecially since there is no action or killing
the last chapterby the way  gives a very new defintion to anticlimaticimportant  if you want to save in chap oh wait  yeahthe game has only  chapters
while it took me  hrsmins to play i had to close the ds and it in sleep mode whileat work but the game clock kept ticking anyway so the extra hours dont count the game can be beaten with about  hour ofplaying time per chapter  not very long
however you can playit again to get different dts card messages and a code at theend of the game
i didnt play it again i just read about thend playthrough in a faq
i had no interest in playing thisgame twice one was enoughback to the chapter  thing if you dont save now you willnot be able to
so after the chapter  title go backinto the trace lab and walk up to the trace chair and click it you can now access the menu to save the game
why
because thelast chapter isnot playable
you just click thorough abunch of dialog
hint turn off the music early on as it themost uninspired music ever
during the last chapter theres avery tense scene between the characters but the music is softand flaccid
this game is indeed for casualers who needsomething to during a long train or plane trips
but if wantaction and in depth story look elsewhere
trace memory will notbe memorable for anyone except for how dull it was dependingon your pint if viewsent via blackberry from tmobile paul j chatmanthis game only works on the older fat ps systems
will not load on the slim models we didnt know this when we ordered  and had no time left on christmas to reorder in a different formatthis fact is the reason for the rating  and it was not stated in the description eithermy wife and i were thrilled when jlh came out and got it immediately
were both big justice league fans mostly from tv but could not help but be very dissapointed with the gamewe played twoplayers and enjoyed the different abilities of the characters
however the overhead view much like the xmen games but not as good often obscured the action and lots of tight spaces made running in tandem difficult more often than it needed toworst is the dramatic depiction of the characters
not to sound too nerdy here but superman is supposed to be well nicegood but was portrayed as overly testosteroney
the cutscene graphics were outdated and made the heroes look unnatractive the storyline was very simple and showed very little creativity
with the wealth of dc story writing they could have done so much betterthe game was very short about  hours
there were destructable surroundings but you dont get anything for destroying your surroundings like powerups or secret items and we broke everything breakableeverything
and when the game ended it just sort of ended no cool closing cutscene for completing the game just looping graphics behind the credits no eastereggs that we found anyway nothing much at allthe designersdevelopers needed to play a few other games to see what they were competing against
i would rather assume they didnt instead of assuming they did and just chose to make a comparitivly weak effort at a game that so many were looking forward toso if you want to play as the flash or unlock hawkgirl you can have some fun but i would warn any buyers to keep their expectations very low because the designers seemed to be just phoning it ini have enjoyed to some extent every myst game that preceded this one
as a kid i played through myst tried to play through riven there was a stupid bug that wouldnt let me get to a very crucial plot location and in more recent years went through the other three titles in the series
although uru was odd and occasionally frustrating in its quests especially in path of the shell where solving the big puzzle requires finding little hints hidden in really random places it was in the end a rewarding experience
though i have not yet finished end of ages i am  thoroughly disappointedas other reviewers have pointed out the worlds dont have the vivacity that they had in previous games
even riven was full of living things movement and atmosphere
though this game is full of the series trademark beauty any life to the art seems purely incidental
anything that looks cool generally is just there as a decorative touch rather than seeming like a living part of the landscape and mystery of the ages
i think the worst loss in this regard comes in the joy of seeing the way aspects of the environment eventually played a part in the adventure
in every myst game before this one there would be objects and locations scattered across the ages that you might see but not know the reason for
as you got closer to solving the bigger puzzles these aspects of the environment would come to life and suddenly everything was connected and it was generally pure genius
in each age in end of ages i found large contraptions and interesting locations that were if anything minor stops along the way
there was no moment where everything came together myst  was by far the best example of these and it makes each world just seem boring in hindsightthe worst thing about this game however is the tablet
when you start exploring the ages in this chapter of the saga you find mysterious creatures that respond to a stone slab located in each age
you can pick up the slab draw on it and drop it
in most locations once you step away from the tablet the creatures will take it and react to what is on it
in each age solving the majority of puzzles involves drawing various symbols on the tablet
unfortunately drawing on the tablet is difficult unless youre an mspaint master or something and generally youll need to either copy the symbols to paper or memorize them
often times youll think your drawing is close and the game wont accept it
often youll find this out fairly quickly and try again but in certain instances you wont know that the game hasnt accepted the symbol until you travel to a completely new location
sometimes the creatures will even take the tablet and put it somewhere else youve already been in the agei am nearly finished with the game
the plot is interesting and for that reason alone i will try to complete it
i just wish the staff could have looked back at what made the first four games and uru great and cleverly utilized those elements to end this fantastic sagaas myst v end of ages opens you find yourself in the kveer section of dni in the room where atrus was trapped all those years ago
nearby you find a strange device
you approach the device and zap
yeesha atruss daughter appears
she tells you of a tablet with mysterious powers
she once was the keeper but failed to use it properly
now it is your destinyas a friend of the family you do keep getting involvedto release the tablet and put it to its proper purposesounds like the set up for a pretty good game doesnt it
unfortunately eoa takes a that concept and falls flat on its face when it comes to execution
this game is boring at best annoying at worst and to get through it i had to resort to a technique id never before used  printing out the walkthrough and following it step by stepim not the kind of gamer who demands the latest bells and whistles in sound and graphics but even i saw a lack in eoa especially coming after the exceptionally animated worlds of revelation and uru
the ages we experienced here were pretty enough but quite static
we saw a few fireflies and falling stars here but aside from that the environment didnt do anything muchand i think at this point in the history of gaming technology theres no excuse for that
and i have to ask myself whats the point of realtime d if nothing happens
whats the point of freedom of movement and degree panning if theres nothing to experience and nothing to seein addition to being boring the ages were tiny
compared to the huge areas of previous games which took days to explore properly these ages seem like a marketing demo  an example of something that could be expanded on if we got the proper funding
one of them you could view from endtoend by standing in a single spot
i suppose this wouldnt have bothered me as much if the puzzles had actually been interesting but once again compared to the agespanning puzzles of previous myst games the puzzles in eoa were just plain stinky
each age had about the same purpose  carry an object from one end of the age to the other
so thats wasnt so dissimilar from other myst games where you had to solve an age and return to a central point
here however the concept failed in numerous ways
first of all there wasnt anything interesting to see along the way
second whereas in other games in the series you have to accomplish a number of integrated tasks to reach your goal in eoa each age essentially contained one puzzle
third the puzzles were just bad
ive heard a number of people say they were too wasy  that wasnt my experience
in fact i found the puzzles so arbitrary and confusing and full of just stupid requirements that i literally could not have got through the game without following a walkthrough ive solved every other myst game with a nudge or two
here were levers you could manipulate but no way of telling what the heck they did  no view from which you could see the results of your work no movie showing you the effect that might be happening in the next room over
there were arbitrary obstacles galore
for example in order to solve one puzzle you had to do something that resulted in haqving your vision impaired to the point that you couldnt see what you were doing and so you had to repeat the process over and over again hoping youd solve the puzzle by luck
every single major puzzle was timed in that you created a necessary event that lasted only a limited time and only during that event could you solve the puzzle
so there was no ability to explore an age at your leisure and figure it out as the effect of your event might only be apparent at the other side of an age
also a particular game device required an inordinate amount of back and forthing
all in all if not extended by artificial means most of these ages coul be solved entirely in five minutes or soa lot of the neat stuff from other myst games was missing
there was no animal life and no animation as ive stated before
there were no nifty rides and slides
there werent cool machines that did amazing stuff
you got to go up and down in an elevator once and that was about it
instead you got an annoying companion on your quest
this guy popped up at intervals usually just when you started to explore something and gave you long pompous speeches which though beautifully voiced by david ogden stiers merely made you want to push the character over a cliff at the soonest opportunity
while im on the subject of character let me add that nothing in this game made me feel any sympathy for any of the characters who appeared
by the end of revelation i felt something for both sirrus and achenar a major accomplishment in character development and back story
but yeesha here just struck me as a whiny fanatic who couldnt get over herselfi dont have as much objection to the story such as it was itself as some others have had
however i missed the personal touch of previous games
you helped atrus because you liked him and cared about his family and because the events of the games affected that family
i couldnt really get how the story of eoa was important to anyone but yeesha
from some of the events of uru i get that it was but the developers failed to convey it in any way that made me care
even the ending failed to move me filled as it was with melodramatic speeches and bad character animation and yes i failed to mention that eoa also lacked the fmv movies of previous games and that this was a major bummeri was really surprised when eoa was announced so shortly after revelation and the release date was less than a year ahead
well the rush shows
this game is barely worth playing and is certainly not worth the inflated price it was issued at
ive been playing this series since myst and i even loved uru
but take my advice leave this one on the shelf
the ending of revelation is way more satisfyingafter the great success of myst iv revelation i had very high hopes for end of ages
plus it is billed as the final myst game ever so how could it not be utterly epic right
well ill start with the positive some of the puzzles in this game are pretty fun and interesting
i remember having an intriguing time figuring many of them out
even here however cracks began to form as one world can be entirely beaten based on a logical guess cheating the player out of a great planetbased challengethat is about where the positives end for this game
the graphics no longer employ actors or interactive still shots instead improving upon the uru drendered approach
while it is a definite improvement over uru i always felt that the old way of approaching the graphic interface was part of what made myst well myst
it felt real not fake
end of ages feels kind of faketo top things off the storyline is an absolute mess especially when trying to wrap up the series
for fans of the atrusbased myst canon this installment does absolutely nothing towards providing even a hint of finality to the seriesim pretty sure that cyan went bellyup after this game was released effectively killing the myst franchise but the sheer inability of end of ages to wrap up any of the true myst mythology leaves the door open at least a crack for a true ending or perhaps even more stories
it seems unlikely at this point to be sure but i think i can speak for most if not all of myst fans when i say that we would relish  another chance to end this thing right
end of ages despite a few decent puzzling experiences really doesnt come close to doing thatwhen i got this game for christmas by accident expected tenkaichi  i figured well maybe it is as fun as the second game
then i found out that it was not what i expected
dragonball z budokai tenkaichi s story mode is the worst mode in the game and you have to play it in order to unlock new characters of course
it is basically a mission based story mode and it is very heavy on its missions for example you have to face against raditz as goku in the saiyan saga but you have to survive until time runs out in tenkaichi  that doesnt matter because you can destroy raditz all you want but here you actually have to let raditz survive not you other wise it would show you a cutscene where it shows that you have won the fight but when you get sent back to the mission select screen you did not pass the mission
the game also changes the computer difficulty at random making some missions impossible to beat and you can not continue on until you beat the specific mission
even though you can change the difficulty in the options menu it wont make a difference when you were doing so well in the last  missions and all of a sudden the enemy starts to attack you from every angle so that you can not escape it why have a difficulty setting when the game chooses it for you
the zitems are worthless they are used as powerups per mission instead of staying on the character in the mode
while that is a pain in the ass there is training mode where you can freely beat the living snot out of your opponents without any worry of missions although you have to keep going back and forth in selection screens to change say goku to super saiyan  goku
overall i give this game  stars it would have been four if the game wasnt a cheating bastard all the timewell im going to start with this
i cheat in my games a lot
i was eager to cheat in my ds games with this new product
however once i opened it i found it slotted into slot  the gba slot on my ds
confused i continued along but was horrified when i found that all it did with the ds games was manage and download saves
the gba codes worked better than they did with my old ar but i was still disappointedi tried this with shining soul ii game would constantly select the last option on any menui tried this with pokemon pinball rubysaphire worked quite welli tried this with pinball of the dead the codes available both online and in the unit did not offer any real gameplay helpi tried this with doom ii no codes available online or in the unitpros  some games work  menu system is easy to use  unit can backup ds gamescons  company is not motivated to release new codes for existing games  unit does not offer cheats for ds games  the scroll to last menu item bug prevents you from playing the games it affectsi dont really see what the big deal is
having defeated  of the  colossi i am still waiting to be drawn into this vast storyline i keep hearing aboutahem but i get ahead of myself
shadow of the colossus is certainly unlike most games ive ever played
you start as aman boy
who is trying to resurrect awoman girl
you journey to a forbidden land to speak with the dormir dormir is latin for sleep by the way who arespirits
who can raise the dead
they propose a challenge  defeat  colossi roaming the land in order to destory  idols in a vacant temple
and thus your story begins
andthats pretty much it to this point
each time you defeat a colossus you return and hearthat you need to defeat another colossus
thats really it other than some poorly translated stuff at the beginning said by some witch doctor or possibly majoras masklets begin with the good
shadow has some of the best graphics ever to grace the ps
in fact theyre a little too good  the ps can hardly handle the graphics stuffed into this one and often skips some animation
this is a minor flaw however and the countryside is both vast and lush with green forests blue lakes excellent shading for light and dark etc
if you want to get a good idea of how great these graphics are you need only observe the fine detail of your horses tail
i mean these graphics are incredible for the psas far as ideas go this game has a good one
rather than bore the player with the tedium of mindless monster encounters which do little but tire your thumbs and fingers there are exactly  enemies in the game not counting the optional lizards which cant really be called enemies anyway
and each battle is epic  the colossi each have weak points to be exploited but its up to the player to figure out how
much of the time a player will have to climb a colossus who generally have furmoss to grip and stab it but getting there is all the challenge
i love the battles in theoryhowever in execution there are numerous problems
the first is the horrible camera
rarely does it move where you want
and while one can lock onto a colossus i have found that often it is detrimental to the players chance of defeating the titan
also the characters running motion is incredibly awkward  one cannot easily run away from a colossus out of the screen
this makes battles that should be easier much more complicated although i havent found any yet that are particularly challengingcontrols are gummy particularly when controlling the horse
climbing colossi is more difficult than it should be because the character often gets hung up you try to move sideways but he wants to go up
the horse is a nightmare all around  his speed is controlled by spurring but it is erratic and he always slows even in a slight turn
this makes overworld travel rather painfuland thats a problem too  while no overworld enemies saves a player from the boredom of fighting  green slimes it unfortunately adds to the frustration when a colossus cannot be found
riding on the horse will fray the nerves of many and youll be doing it a lotthe music
not bad but nothing special
and even if it was great it is so sparse as to be forgettable despite its greatness
you will get music while fighting colossi and it is helpful  a change in music usually means youre on the right path to defeating the giant and a small theme each time you enter a colossus realm but thats itand we end where we began
i have no doubt that this game has a great story  somewhere
unfortunately it has developed so slowly that most will give up before they see the payoff
ill stick with it because i enjoy the colossus battles but it isnt surprising that some people dont see what the hubbub is about
i surely dontat the momentall in all an intriguing idea mixed with good gameplay great graphics mediocre control and zero story at least through  colossi and you pretty much have a dudi accept the fact that i am in the minority with disliking this game but i feel i must speak out against itfirst off this is the only game i have ever played for  minutes and didnt speak to one person or fight one monster
and that is not a good thing
most of the time the directions your magic sword give you are very vague and can lead you to dead ends and such in search of these colossus
it is not my idea of fun to run in circles for  minutes desperately trying to find something to doalso as a whole the entire package of this game is desolate
the manual is very vague and short the blurbs on the back of the box are short and the game is entirely empty
it is entirely possible to spend more time in this game finding a colossus than actually fighting itrunning around the desolate land wouldnt be too bad if there were things to do
the only thing to do besides fighting those tall colossus is to hunt and kill little lizards and to find fruit in trees
both of these tasks are boring beyond belief and extremely unrewardingbut what about the colossus battles
well they are not as good as i thought they would beeach colossus has these little glowing magical circles on their bodies that tells you that that is their weak point
you have to find a way to get to this glowing circle so you can stab it
after you stab this glowing symbol enought times it will magically reappear at another spot on the monsters body
you then have to find a way to climb to its new location so you can stab it againto me this was very unrewarding gameply
it pretty much boils down to a game of find the glowing magical circle so you can stab it
rinse and repeat  timesand i didnt even mention the games horrible controls and camera system which are a bigger challenge than any colossus turns out to bein the end i was very disappointed with this title
this is one of those niche games that you either love or hate
i might be in the minority but this games slow and hollow gameplay did not impress me
rent this before buying it blindlyupdate june th  not that anyone cares but i take back some of what i said in this review back in  or at least i take back the overly hateful tonei havent played the game again but i overreacted and i feel stupid that i crapped all over a piece of art like shadow of the colossus
its just that i enjoyed ico so much  its one my favorite games of all time  and i had a kneejerk and emotional reaction to not getting ico  one day im going to play sotc again and i still dont think ill like it as much as ico but this review sounds very immature
old original reviewits probably my fault but i was hugely disappointed in this game
i was hoping for something more along the lines of ico since the makers of this game also made that one
ico was one of the best games ive played on the ps up there with one of my all time favorites
a beautitful game filled with challenging puzzles and tons of emotion and atmosphere
for collosus they kept the beautiful artistic graphics and same look and feel yet dumped everything else
all thats left is riding around on a horse with absolutely nothing to do in between fighting the collosi
no im not looking for wave after wave of meaningless monsters and fights
this is an unfinished game
i really believe the developers started with this outline but couldnt finish perhaps because their ideas were too grandiose
this is a demothe horse is an excellent idea and everything about is well done so its a shame it goes to waste
fighting each collosus is interesting and fun but after  or  of them its gets very repetitive
you spend time and energy finally figuring out their patterns and weak spots which is good in itself but you get nothing for your effort except to do it all over againcome on lets stop with all the way overboard rave reviews here
someone said its like ico meets metroid prime
stop it its nothing like metroid prime and all the stuff that made ico good was taken out
i know im going to get a lot of negative votes for this review but somebody has to step up and give an alternate opinion and warn ico players before they waste their moneythe bottom line ico was a fantastic once in a lifetime game filled with umatched atmosphere emotion and gameplay
surely something close to ico  would be made right
no ico didnt sell all that well
water it down take out the complexity and puzzles
fight big monsters
ride horse
there ya go shadow has been a best seller
what a disgrace monsters to fight and a sword that shows you not only how to find them but where to hit them to kill them
thats all there is to the game play of this title
the graphic are stunning in many cases and the  colossus monsters are works of art but the game play itself is tedious
you run around the countryside following the directions of your sword to find a colossus then use the sword to find its weak spots
then you just need to figure out how to climb up on it which is about the only puzzle of the game
once on a monster you spend most of your time hanging on and using the joystick to tell your character which way youd like them to move and then waiting to see if hell be able to move or if hell run out of strength from hanging on and fall off instead
repeat for the remaining  colussi
the second colossus cant even kill you  i let the main character stand in the middle of the battlefield for  minutes every minute or so the colossus would stomp me and id loose health but id recover it by the time he came around againhint dont fight the direction the horse wants to go it knows where its goingone of the most criticallyacclaimed games for the ps shadow of the colossus has amassed a legion of staunch defenders
however after only a short time playing its many shortcomings become apparent leaving any objective gamer wondering why it receives the support that it doessotc ultimately boils down to an overgrown puzzle game
the box and the trailers will make it look like an actionrpg hybrid in a fantasy setting but its none of those things
each colossus must be killed by figuring out how to grab on and scale its body to find its weak points
once youre there you repeatedly stab the weak point and hope you have enough grip left to hold on until it dies
otherwise you simply have to start the climb all over again and repeat the processthis is one of the most linear games ever  findkill no then findkill no
 then findkill well you get the idea
also the bulk of the time spent playing this short  only about ten hours game is in the finding of each colossus lair
it could very well have been called wander around lost for hours en route to killing the same boss over and over gamethe travel time stems from a gameplay environment that is huge yet ultimately pointless
the map is gigantic but aside from save point temples and the colossi themselves there are no other points of interestactivity at allmany praised sotcs art direction but i found it to be nothing special
first i enjoy  million shades of pale green and grey as much as the next guy but this was overkill
the lush mossy terrain gives way to endless fields and majestic mountains but after a short while it gets very repetitive and again adds nothing but ornament to the gameplay
plus the moving objects all look pretty obviously sewntogether
overall the graphics push the capabilities of the ps so far that frame drag and other motion problems are frequentwhen actually doing battle with one of he colossi the camera simply does not work
it drifts flips and generally does what it pleases at the most irritating and inopportune times
have fun trying to track the flying colossusthe storyline starts out as a paintbynumbers plot involving a magical quest that the hero must undertake in order to revive his dead girlfriend
there are hints promising plot twists later in the game but they dont develop into anything
the ending thats presented is lengthy but ultimately selfindulgent nonsense
and of course you dont do anything during this protracted ending other than watch it happenthe music is a bland knockoff of ff and every other synthsymphonic score
there is also not enough of it so that it gets very very repetitive after only a short amount of gameplay
but worst of all is the fit to the action  even during the fight scenes the music is often this melancholy dirge that reinforces how much this game feels like a dreadful task thats fallen on your noble shoulders to completethis feeling of dread is compounded by the sympathetic feeling of your foes
for the first time ever a game has created an experience that makes you feel bad for having won
sotc feels like clubbing baby seals to me
maybe if the story had explained why these slowmoving seemingly docile creatures needed to be viciously stabbed to death id be able to better cope
or maybe if i didnt generally have to initiate the fight by shooting arrows into it until its finally mad enough to defend itself
or maybe if more than half of them actually fought back
or maybe if a single one of them had ever managed to kill little ol me during the game
alternate title hunting gentle elephants for their ivory or maybe even just out of boredom gamemany will kneejerk disagree with me over this one but i feel that many more will be disappointed after blindbuying this title
it looks like much more than it really is  a task list of puzzles to be solved with a lot of pointless wandering around in between each
add in graphical problems and a camera that fights you harder than any of the colossi and youve got a real unengaging time
at least its also a very brief gamei got this game because of the high rating it has on most game sites but when i actually plaid it i found out that it didnt live up to the hype
the over world is giant and empty
the controls are pretty bad but you get use to them
the story is well i wouldnt know completely because i didnt want to finish the game
the boss battles which are the only battles where well staged and beautiful they really made me feel epic and grand
however this feeling only lasted the first  minutes of the battle then the feeling went completely away
the battles ranged about  to  minutes to complete which means you could probably finish this game in about  to  hoursoverallits a short game with an empty world bad controls looping  second music simple story line repetitive gameplayexperiences good scenery and barely good boss battles
the cons outweigh the pros
 out of  upadatecan i first get out of the way that i had no idea when i boughtreturned this the cultlovefollowing this game had
in fact i may just have to try the ps remaster and see if i feel different
the wow factor of this game stops the minute you try to battle the first colossus
jump on back of right leg stab climb up thigh to belt up back stab in head find next colossusthe surreal dreamlike land and stunning difficult battles are not enough
this game leaves you with a hollow pointless feeling
the package puts you in mind of fable or the legend of zelda but the game is neither
it reminds me of a throwback to the arcadestyle platform games of the original nes and ps when you could defeat all the levels and then just fight the bossbattles thats this game bossbattles and cutscenes
this is not action adventure or roleplaying its bossbattles and animated cut sceneswhy create so big a game with so little to do
could have been such an amazing game with  quest quest items caves dungeons mountains to explore but no nothing but vast vast emptiness
thats what youll feel when youre doneall it really is is fighting these really huge beasts
the horse is really hard to navigate theres nobody to talk to no buildings to go into and the big beasts you have to fight are really hard to fightbut running around the landscape is kinda fun
some of the scenery is really pretty but if i had played this before buying iti would not have spent  bucks on itthis game is so overratedthis is the most boring video game i have ever played in my lifeall you do is just walk around and fight these huge monstersthats itnothing or nobody else aroundexcept for you and youre horseonly good thing that i can say about this gameis the graphicsthey are amazingthats why i gave it a instead of a the graphics imo are the only good thingthis game has going for iti say rent itbefore you buy iti bought it for twenty bucksnow it just sits in my drawerwhen i heard that the team that created ico was going to create another game i was excited
ico was released years ago near the pss launch and though slightly flawed it was a wonderful game
now that the team had time to master the ps it could improve the graphics and make an ico like game even better
well not quiteyou first start off in a temple and you have to go after a colossus
you then ride your horse to the area where the colossus is
the area where you ride your horse through is expansive though nice looking is pretty monochrome
the horse riding is a little annoying because the camera is sort of half done meaning that you can move the camera but it will move back for no reason at random times and there is no stationary camera angle
most games give you the option of keeping the camera directly behind you so you can move by the direction of the screen
this does not and i found it very very annoyingonce you reach the colossus you face a large lumbering stone giant and you have to defeat it
its just like a giant boss battle
you have to climb up it somehow which is where the puzzle portion comes in and hit the weak spotsthat is pretty much the game
ride to the colossus defeat it rinse repeat
after about three colossi i was bored to death
this game has a total of  of them
each one takes a really long time
uh no thankswhile the colossi look great and the music is good graphically the rest of the game is fully of jaggies that really shouldnt exist in a game engine these days
the world to explore is really very empty with nothing to do
the camera angle is the biggest obstacle and i found the controls to be awkward as well
like all boss battles there is a lot of repetition in defeating the boss
you get to a certain point and you either die or you fall and have to climb up the boss again
so there is a lot of repeating
and no you cant save in the middle of a boss fighti wanted ambiance puzzles thinking new worlds to explore
i wanted a new version of ico or prince of persia sands of time
instead i got thisif you are the type of guy that only cares about the final boss this game is made for you
if you wanted another thinking mans platformer youd better look elsewherei had really high expectations for this game since the reviews were great but i never could get into it
it does have great graphics but that was about as far as it went for me
now it just sits and collects dustbut not the worst
this is my first venture into the world of ape escape and i cant say it was horrible but not particularly interesting
this is a bunch of minigames where youre at an academy trying to advance on to the next grade level
each grade level consists of nine mini games youll have to play through
the games are randomly generatedi suppose what i had trouble with with this game was getting the required lines to graduate
if theres a moment where you just know youre not going to do it you cant just start over
which annoyed the hell out of methe mini games are simple puzzles
memory games and reflexes mostly
theyre predictable and rather stale
youll also find games like soccer hockey and the like
most games are self explanatory but when you come across a game that you just dont know what to do the game does a really bad job of explaining what you need to doyoure invited to play through grades and such again for statues but thats really it
which is also pretty annoying
what
no unlockable secrets
just a statue thats not really worth anything other than bragging rights
likewise single player mode is incredibly short and thats bad
it wouldnt be as grueling if the load times werent bad as well
these load times can take up to a minute
most of these puzzles and mini games probably wont take you nearly as long as it takes the game to loadvisually it looks alright
its very vibrant and colorful and its probably the only good thing about the game
well that and you can play with three other friends off one umd
however the music is annoying and the game just all out isnt fun
a kid might get some enjoyment out of it but not someone who is actually expecting a decent game
i hear the platform ape escapes are pretty good and ill try those out as well
however i cant help but admit that this game is just not all that greatso save your money
if you must have this game wait for a price drop or something
forty dollars for a game that youll probably only spend an hour playing and maybe forty of those minutes will be load times isnt worthwhile
after completing these minigames theres nothing that makes you want to play it again
thats a problem
so dont waste your hard earned cash on this thingthe idea behind this game is great the problem is the eyetoy camera is simply not ready for the concept
even if you have ideal lighting and space in the room w your ps there will be many times that your score is affected by the camera not registering hits
some game modes work fairly well but some like the aerobics section fail miserably
i cant tell you how irritating it is when youre punching an orb ten times and it wont register a hit and the lighting in the room is perfect and theres no furniture in the background
hopefully theyll come out w a better eyetoy camera if they make future versions of this game
its simply too frustrating to stick w any kind of exercise program on here and i lost interest after a weekreviewed this earlier but it is not a good purchase as the camera just isnt what they say it will be when you hook it upi ordered this copy specifically to get the standard version to replace an old scratched disk
there was clearly a choice between the standard version or the  version on the page
i chose standard version and selectgo ship from us
no import tax as the seller
i received the  version which means my previous saved games from my scratched disk will not work
i did not return since i am not in a location that it would be practical for a nine dollar purchase
if you are determined to get the original game then roll the dice with another seller
 stars because it is gta sa it arrived and it does work
 star because it wasnt what i ordered and wont use previous saved games or modsthis game is highly highly overrated
at first i thought it was really good too until i started playing more
when you think of grand theft auto you think of riding around doing whatever you want mugging people and killing cops right
well this game seems to embrace those gaming ideals but unfortunately its all a lie
this game is actually completely linear
if you want to ride around doing whatever you want ive got news for you  first of all you wont have much to do and second youll be dead or in jail really quick
mug or kill someone and the police are on to you
theres a  star level of how wanted you are
at  stars youll be chased all over the map no matter where or how fast you go
you will not be able to kill the police or evade them
your only choice is to go to a spray shop pay  to get your car painted so the cops wont recognize you
this gets old really fast
its linear because there are actually missions you have to complete and you cant pick and choose which ones to do
the missions are cool but just now i played one where you have to win a lowrider hydraulics contest
you have to keep your hydraulics in time with the music
unfortunately i couldnt figure out how to do this or if i didnt know some of the controls so i fail the mission and i cant move forward in the game until i win the contest
in my opinion thats really lame
it reduces this whole game to a simple press this button in time with this music game
yes the music the atmosphere and the dialogue is all wonderful and hilarious
driving around listneing to gangsta music and shooting people is fun
the details and ideas put into this game are really cool but the design of the actual gameplay leaves a lot to be desiredthis is not the best pc game ever despite what critics have said about the game on the ps
first of all the dvd takes  minutes to spin before you can install the game
then it takes nearly  minutes to install the game
what kind of system do i have
a brand new alienware area   with the best hardware  the package even says that it runs great on alienware
so why the extremely long install
then once i finally got the game installed i crashed numerous times whenever a movie was played the parts where they give the missions
take tech support was very helpful  i give them credit
turns out despite having a new machine i had to update every driver for the graphics and sound
before you even play the game you will need to do the same
anyway i loved grand theft auto  for the pc
it was a great port from the consoles with enough changes to make it fun on the pc
but this game lacks some of that polish
for example what happened to the strafe mode
you could strafe in gta but in san andreas moving left and right actually turns your character instead of stepping left and right
i thought the advantage of a keyboard and mouse was to have mouselook enabled for better targeting
the game does not like that very much and is played better when you hold a button for targeting
talk about consoleitis
there are far too many commands to map onto the keyboard for this game
i spent  minutes to get it to be usable and was still frustrated
i picked up my saitek gamepad to play with the game instead and things got a bit better
imagine that  owning a pc and having to use a gamepad to play instead of a keyboard and mouse
they got gta right on the pc  i had no trouble with the controls
why the change to the more complex control schemes
the graphics are amazing
they are better than any other gta game
but i still see problems like why does the main character cj have a bold line and different skin colors where his head attaches to his neck
why is his nose white
why when i exit a car the main character clips though the door
all these things should easily be fixed on the pc version of the game
i have only started playing and i know the game will open up and be fun and entertaining
despite my complaints as a pc game gta games are always fun
but maybe i expected a better experience on the pc
maybe i thought the game would be cleaned up some and operate less like the console version the way gta was a huge improvement over its counterparts
keep this in mind  if you are buying gta san andreas for the pc you might not be getting the best version
and that is too bad  they had a chance to make a killer gamethis review is for the pc port of the game the original ps version is easily a  star product
the controls for the pc are so terrible that it goes beyond a simple lazy port i think it was an actual joke by rockstar on the pc users
not since the early s has a default pc key configuration been literally impossible to use
for example for the forklift mission to control the forklift you use wasd to steer the mouse to control the camera and to move the fork up and down they chose numberpad  and  now try to hit w number pad  and move your mouse at the same time
easy if you happen to have  arms
the number pad couldnt possibly be further away from wasd that isnt just laziness that is sabotage
the most fundamental control options simply dont exist
doom which came out in  more than  years before gta sa allowed you to select a weapon with the  keys
in gta you must cycle through your weapons with the mouse wheel
the last straw was when i failed to purchase chicken from the chicken restaurant because the command to exit wasdrum roll please enteri was having problems recently with my cddvd drive and it would not load any games from cd rom disk
so i purchased gta san andreas so it would be installed on my drive
after several hours of downloading and the installation i booted up the game
the first thing i noticed was the game was lagging and shaky
at times the screen would freeze for a moment and then continue to run
this caused me to uninstall and reinstall i believe to correct the problem yet it didnt
i purchased a new cddvd drive and ran my previously purchased gta cdrom disk perfectly
then digital download did not run as smooth
another issue is that the download will not record when using software from a well known site
the disk records perfectly but not the download
i have experienced this problem with another digital download
the games wont record but the disks will
yet my other game i purchased from amazon by download had no problems at all running
i dont know what the problem is possibly the digital downloads are some how protected
i dont know
i like the convenience of ordering through amazon at home when i need it instead of traveling to the city to pick up my gameslots of great bikes
even buells
a lot of the license tests are just like real tests you would take in a state certified class
but thats where the simulation endsthe game is hard to play
and the physics are so far off its pathetic
not even close
the physics are almost backwards
as anyone who rides a bike can tell you hard braking while in a turn is going to put you on the pavement
not here
once i was on a downhill straightaway heading into a turn
i brake hard before reaching the turn and end up in a highside flip
what the
bogus
that might happen if i lock the rear wheel and then release the back brake
at this point i put the game down
as far as i got in the game youre not racing in a pack but trying to catch one guy
deplorableafter putting this game away i popped in motogp  just to get my gp fix
that game is awesome
 to  lap races with  riders in the pack that can last  minutes
by the time youre into the last  laps youre not battling the bike youre battling the leaders for st or second place
and youre exhausted
just like real bike racing
if youre looking for a great sportbike game play the motogp series instead
it shreds on this
to the reviewer below who said motogp isnt realistic
the physics are spot on
especially traction physics
and if you want simulation in that series there is a simulation setting that makes the bikes handle with more realism
its a nobrainer when compared to tourist trophy
i get the feeling some of these reviewers have never ridden bikesthis one gets  stars for the bikes and the tracks
what a disappointmentthis is a game for kids under the age of   it has cool comic book style cut scenes but the actual gameplay is short simplistic and either way too hard or way too easy
and no you dont get to freeroam with venom
you can only use him as part of storymode
ive been a huge spidey fan for well over  years but this game was a total letdown
if youre still in middle school you might like it
anyone else should stick with spiderman  or get the new xmen legends insteadim a huge spiderman fan but im sorry to say this game was kind of dissapointing
the graphics are great the story is interesting although it kind of leaves everything hanging not everyone is going to by the next issue of usm to find out what happens the gameplay is good too many chase scenes thoughbutthe game lasted  hours
that means that each hour of gameplay costs you  freaking dollarsits just not worth iti enjoy a challenge but this game it way too hard
its not fun to fail a mission more than tens times
plus when you fail it offers you a chance to retry but you still have to go through all the talking again
which is annoying  boringthis game could have been fun but its too hard
the patients vitals drop way too quickly
and theres pretty much only  way to do each mission
i had to look at a walk through to get through every other mission
there were a couple of times i wanted to snap the frickin ds in half
of course i didntim just really glad i didnt buy this gamethough trauma center is an interesting game for the ds i would not reccomend you purchase it when there are so many other games that are more involvedtrauma center involves you being a surgeon
you perform different surgeries on peoplethe game falls short in many areas
for one i found the difficulty to be a little too high
this is because you might not figure out which tool to use exactly until its too late
even then sometimes the characters will talk at the top of the screen and say things moments before you need to do them
you have the special power to slow down time when you are performing
sometimes they will just screwm out to you to use this power and if you dont your patient dies within secondsanother thing sometimes the game becomes more tedious than fun
even if you know what to do it can be annoying to have to do the same  steps over and overi would reccomend that you buy animal crossing if you are looking for differentwhile the bigbreasted women didnt offend me it didnt excite me either
i still found the game to be a rather big disappointmenthaving only one character fight at a time was a big disaster
it makes the game feel old and unappealingmany times the enemies appear to be hidden when youre inside a dungeon
i cant figure out what im doing wrong
the run button practically doesnt exist because the second you run an enemy will find and kill youyou might want to look for another rpg because this one didnt work for memagna carta is game ive been eagerly anticipating for some time now
it comes from atlus who have a great track record when it comes to localizing niche rpgs for the dedicated player
it features fairly high production values with its detailed environments and d character models
the cgi is gorgeous
unfortunately this is one of the most sluggish frustrating games i have ever played
i hear japanese gaming magazine famitsu declared magna carta tears of blood to be one of the worst rpgs on the ps
i wouldnt go quite that far as for all the teeth nashing i did i still was able to play it until the very endthe story of magna carta focuses on calintz leader of the tears of blood a mercenary group with the corniest name ever
the tears are helping to fight a long running war with the yason a magically elflike race
things go wrong during a mission and calintz meets reith a mysterious girl who cant remember anything
they strike up a rather awkward romance awkward in the sense that reith is the goodygoody peaceloving type and calintz while dedicated to peace in his own way peace to him meaning destroying the yason
reith tries to discover her mysterious origins and calintz searches for the magna carta a legendary superweapon that can flatten the yason
despite the fact that this description features a ton of story cliches the story is actually pretty good even though it unfurls at a snails pace
this story is not shy about presenting the unpleasant consequences of war and is refreshingly lacking the black and white morality of most fantasy storieswhile the world of magna carta is quite the visual treat the same cant be said of the aural experience
the background music is adequate but unmemorable
the game opens with a terrible song called tears of blood
the lyrics on this thing are really embarassing and cheesey
voice acting is usually a nice touch unless its done wrong
here its done really really wrong
this stuff could curdle milkwhile story is a very important factor in these types of games magna carta drives home the point that you also need a good battle system to carry you through  hours of gameplay
this is were magna carta gets really sluggish
it uses a quasireal time system were you can move freely about the battle screen
a meter fills up and when it reaches a certain point you can attack
there is no such thing as simply bashing a monster with your sword
you must correctly time a series of three button presses then the character will glow say some line like i have been trained to kill
 and then launch into a complicated looking attack
sure it looks cool but after the first few hours youll wish things would move faster
did i mention you can only control one person at a time and the others stand there like foolsthis system is also effected by a myriad of other things like how much the characters like you at the moment which is effected by things like what sort of gifts you give them and what the local fortuneteller said the number of enemies and allies currently on the field what kinds of chi is currently available and how many times a friend or foe can block attacks
all attacks are based on one of eight types of chi
if your attack is based on a chi type that isnt available you cant do anything unless you happen to have a chi restoring talisman
the system is not difficult but sluggish and cheap
a normal enemy encounter can last well over  minutes
that should not beadding to the sluggish battle system is a sluggish system of exploration
you can explore in detect mode where you roam at a snails pace but can surprise or avoid enemy in encounters or run mode where you move faster but will miss treasure chests and will be surprised by the enemy effectively letting them pound you into game over
in magna carta if you have to go somewhere it will be by foot
it takes a long time to get anywhere because the world is expansive and you will be traveling the roads at the speed of a turtle
couple this with the slow battle system and it takes forever and a day to get anything done
more than once i wanted to rip my hair outmagna carta is a game only for people with extreme patience
i imagine the vast majority of people who pick it up will throw it down after a few hours
when i saw the end credits role i for one was filled with great relief that it was over
games should fun
magna carta just isnti had to restart this game twice
the first time it just had trouble holding my interest
while i really liked the characters i could read what was going to happen and nothing was very enjoyable
i also hate games where a main character dies that had you invested into the story to begin with
i felt that after all the game play spent the ending was a real let down
did not match the story you watched unfold in my opinion
while the background story was great they lost it  throughthe fighting style was new and i did enjoy getting into the groove of it
problem was i didnt even know what counter mode was until the end of the game and by then it was difficult to get the flow when i needed it now
this could have been a great game but too many different flaws were found that brought it dowmlast year i bought tears of blood and played about one third of the way through it before running into a bug when the game allowed me to do several things out of sequence
i wasnt all that thrilled with the game and put it aside for some day when i would feel more motivated
it only took a year for me to come back invest some  hours in game play to realize that not only was i not thrilled but i disliked it intenselylets start out with the good things
the general level of animation and graphics is very good
although there is not nearly as much cgi as the trailer promised
the story which is about a long conflict between humans and elflike race galled the yason is a good one with complex characters who have many sides
so  a pretty face an interesting plot and unfortunately a director yeonkyo choi from hell
this is the first game that i can honestly say feels like the development staff was dedicated to irritating the player
the game suffers from interface woes in particular a live mapping system which often shows the player moving in the opposite direction from the camera shot
something to which i never quite got accustomed
and the story is full of those strange moments when characters do something that makes no sensethe story is interesting but the flow through the game is forced
there is a level of parallelism since there are usually two teams in the field and you can switch between them but the progress is really inexorable  there arent any alternative branches
for example you can kill a boss who is supposed to beat you  the game just ignores the whole event and continues on
on fault of the two party approach is that you are often forced you through exactly the same paths twice complete with the same tired monstersmany of the characters are unlikeable
antagonistic streetfighters bossy paranoid priestesses who dress up as eightyearolds and starryeyed overdeveloped waifs complete for your attention
the star of the show is callintz a crossdressing mercenary and captain of the tears of blood consumed with hatred for the yason
dont get me wrong the yason are just as bad as the humans  everyone gets demonized equally
to top this off the voice acting is positively wooden
the battles are full of little phrases that after a while will drive you crazy
that and several not quite hidden bronx accentsmost of the blame for the games failure is due to the battle system which depends on the mix of eight powers or chi in the area of the battle and uses a fight wheel which requires that you enter a combination of x and o buttons at specific moments
this is a little like shadow hearts but tears of blood carefully varies the timing to throw the player off stride continually
in addition to this standard mode there are two alternative modes that have you combining moves  keystrokes and up or guessing what your opponent is doing to counter it
both of the latter require a lot of finger coordination and hours invested into getting them right
unfortunately one of them is required to progress through the game and it was only the discovery of a line of instruction in a downloaded walkthrough that kept me from giving up on the game for the second timethe game simply lacks the magnetism to make you want to overcome all the difficulties that the choi throws in your path
which is one of the reasons it has never sold very well
there have been a lot of good rpg releases in the past two years
unless you have lightening reflexes and the patience of a saint save your money for one of those  youll be happier for itthis controller does the job but in a rather lackluster manner
at only  the cord is too short to use comfortably at the distance i sit from my television
the construction is extremely cheap even the circle of paper around the buttons is bubbling
most importantly the controls are stiff
the l and r buttons were sticking when i first got it though im pleased to say they loosened up over time and work fairly well now
but overall i would have just paid a few more bucks for a better controller if i had it to do over again
this thing just collects dust in favor of my old onethis game was fun at first but then it got way to easy like all nascar games
its only fun when you are playing with  or more people
i would reccomed it if you can get it for under  bucks because thats all its worthsome of you may be looking for just an arcade type experience where anything goes
if so you may like nascar  total team control
but as for me
i want some sort of realism
it doesnt have to be perfect but man lets get it closei truly believe that no one at ea has ever watched a nascar race
if you have watched a race let me put it in perspective for you
i have gotten airborne flipped  or  times and seen other ai cars do the same
we all finish the race  fix the damage with a pit stop 
anyone who watches nascar knows that cars that flip  or  times do not finish  of the time
the only way to dnf in this game is to run out of gas or get so much damage that you blow your engine
ai cars never dnf
they can flip explode bounce jump get explosive diarrhea or whatever and they will always be there at the endin real nascar races cars blow engines the big one happens now and then cars wreck out etc
not in nascar  
you want stats 
nascar  has got emnot 
you cant keep track of anything except the standings for the current season
no trophy room no personal stats or anythingthey also took a good two stick control system and added a crappy poorly responsive one
bring back the old controls 
the rivalry system sucks too
you just tap someone even if you had nothing to do with it and suddenly the guy who hit you hates you and will die trying to get you back
even if you are in a chain reaction wreck that starts waaaaay ahead of you everyone behind you who makes contact with you as you try to avoid the mess or spin out will hate youalso if you are in fight to the top mode and buy a racing team there are issues
there is a major glitch that freezes the game if you try to drive for dale jr or roush in the busch series and it will make you start completely over
also lets say you buy penske racing after accumulating enough money over the years
you cannot change the name from penske to lets say joes racing or anything else you might want
and despite being the owner of the  car  car and your car you can only modify yours and cannot modify any of the other cars on your team nor can you modify hire or fire drivers for your teami could go on and on
i am not just an ea basher
i have loved the madden series and so wish that we could get a good realistic nascar game
i would be a loyal purchaser if they could get it right but i will never buy another ea nascar game until i rent one and see what i am looking forsave yourself the money and dont buy this crap
the load times suck toohope you get to see this ea if you ever want to win us backever since nascar thunder  eas nascar games have been progressively getting worse
in  you couldnt make but  custom cars
in previous years you could create as many as your memory card could hold
however there are two major disappointments  perhaps the biggest disappointment when it says you can own a team i thought you could create several of your own cars and forge a team with them
but the only option you have is to create your own car which is one car and then you had to buy real racing teams such as hendrick or roush for example
i was so thrilled about this game because of my expectations
but when i saw this i just set the controller down and almost cried
another big disappointment the lack of tools to construct the custom cars
i have driven my car  and my teammates car  for three years
in   you couldnt use  anymore so there went my car and you cant use the blend paint scheme and i cant remember if you can even use oreilly anymore so there went  tooseriously dont even consider buying this game unless you are doing for a collections sake like i did
my favorite game is nascar thunder  and it will be finding my tv screen alot more often than this pile of crap
i gave it  stars just because of its ability to play all the series
ea has managed to maintain the nascar franchises integrity slightly due to thatif youre looking for something like world of warcraft everquest or even asherons call  made by the same company look elsewhere
this game is very slow paced and boringthe good points of this gamethe bad points of this gamelousy graphics
graphics are about on the same level of asherons call
in other words it looks datedlousy voice acting
it sounds like everything was narrated by the same guy and every time you enter a dungeon there is a little bit of narration
this gets irritating in the first hour
when the guy doing the voice overs tries to sound like a monster you just want to turn your speakers off
its really really badgame play
they tried to reinvent the wheel on game play by using the left mouse button to rotate your character and the right mouse button to attack
this makes it pretty much impossible to rotate your character and attack at the same time
they also added in some jumping and rolling stuff which works about as well as the whole mouse setupthe first quest are very repetitive go smash things and fight an occasional monster
repeat  times literally
monsters and creatures rarely drop anything in fact i cant remember them ever dropping anythinghealing
you can only heal in the tavern
you do not regenerate anything while in the dungeons
this means that at any given time there are a ton of people sitting in the tavern waiting to regenerate health
can you say lag
i knew you could
you can buy food to speed up health regeneration but again this only works in the tavernthe world
to sum it up tiny
if you are looking for expansive areas to explore and wander about in you will be very disappointed
this entire game seems to be one cramped city area after another
in fact i believe the entire thing is inside a city to no open forests or hilly grasslands to explore
at least thats what it looks like from the maps tat come with the gameoverall this is a lackluster game that tries to force you to play in a group the entire time and adds nothing new to the many mmorpgs that are out there
unless you are diehard dd fan skip this gameturbine should be ashamed of themselves
this is a step backwards from asherons callyou knowi was pretty excited about this when i first heard about it
me and dd go way back to   having been an avid fan of mmorpgs for years it was nice to hear that the grandaddy of all fantasy gaming was gonna get some attention and take a shot at what is arguably the biggest fad in pc gaming
now i must say that i was a bit skeptical at first
most dd games that arent ye olde pen and paper can be really iffy
this one is not an exception
itshow should i say
not goodall the things people are saying about the interface being clunky and the game play being repetitive are true
its a nightmare especially having come over from world of warcraft
which is a morpers dream
go get this instead
now if this was my first morp and considering ive played dd for about s of my life i would probably love it not having known any better
cuz after all its freakin dungeons and dragonssadly the game doesnt translate well to mmorpg format
poor interface and madatory grouping aside what drives me nuts about this game is that once you do manage to find some people and go on a quest no one sticks together
in other morps ive played there is a solid need for cooperation and patience but in this its completely willy nilly and keeping people organized is like pulling teethfrom a live shark
its bloody awful
my thoughts are thisif you want to play dd dont put down your diceif you want to play a good fantasy mmorpg go try something else
except for eq
thats no good either
so thereim going to keep this short and to the point
there is very little solo content in this game
it reminds me much more of guild wars than wow daoc eq or eq ii
the only mmo going on in this game is when your waiting for a group which you must be a part of to quest in a practical manner
i joined up for the head start preorder but after playing the game ill probably never pay them a dime to play once my free  days is up
honestly i feel like i just tossed  plus out the window
i can only hope vanguard is betteri was really looking forward to this game
unfortunately there just isnt enough of it to justify a montly chargewhy
people maxxed out characters just  days after the game went live
think about that for a second
there just isnt much content in this game no matter what fans of pnp ddo will try to tell youwhen you ask them why there are not things in the game that should be they just try to say its because it isnt your normal wow or eq or whatever
they try to insult your intelligence because you find the game lacking
sorrylack of content is lack of contentno housingno mountsno world at all
this is all one city and its boringno sizing of charactersno variety in starting quests
all characters start exactly the samethere are so many other nos in the game but its just not even worth the time to list themturbine is adding content to the game unfortunately it may be too little too late
the town and the starting quests are already hard to bear with almost nobody online to group with and since you are forced to group this is a terrilbe situationpeople will say find a guild get on a more populated server whatever
these are things that shouldnt be a problem with a game only a couple weeks old
going into the future it will only get worse
forced grouping with absolutely no other option for solo play at all is stupidsorry to say
pass this one byi am astonished that dd of all people cant put together a fun mmorpg game
the graphics are great but it doesnt matter because  the frustrations are numerousi used to play dd when i was very young but lets face it im not so young anymore so i dont remember what feats i should choose at the character creation screen before the game has actually started
i shouldnt need to have a ba
in dd to figure out what  skills i need to start the game withthis might be true to dd but it is no fun
want to regenerate health and mana during a dungeon
no
oh you can but only at one spot and only once
if you wipe start over
you heard mestart over
delightful
i was in a party with a mage
he used his spell power in the first fight
cant get it back
in the  fights that followed he stood around and watched uslet me mention the control system
incredibly unwieldly
in the early stages youre just never sure whether to right or left click
oddly rightclicking makes you attack no matter if you have anything targeted or not
so the  million of us who play world of warcraft or everquest  or just about any first person shooter who use the right mouse button for free mouse look are swinging weapons everywhere for no reason
i dare you to stand in a town and watch people talking to npcs
almost all of them will randomly swing their weapon during a conversation walking around using the bathroom whatever
whoosh
whoosh
the air is full of pointless mace swings that do d damage
my saving throw versus ineffective ui just failedtry this on for size  or  missions in you have to be in a group full of people who have only been playing the game for  hours so no one knows what the heck theyre doing and the mission is classified as get this long
were taking  minutes on a noobie mission
no chance in hedouble hockey sticks thats going to be any funand the in game speech options
sounds great but its pointless
i turned it on at the request of my party leader so that i could hear a yearold yell at me to watch out for kobolds about a million timeskill a monster get experience points right
no
only get xp from finishing encounters of groups
i played for  solid hours and i got about  way to level  level 
barely any drops unless you like breaking  barrels per dungeon and picking up the pennies that spew outtrust me i wanted to play this game so bad
i anticipated it forever
and it just stinks
not like was that you
stink more like is that a dead raccoon in your mailbox stink
awfulit is in my mind the defining reason that mmorpgs will soon have to give us a free trial period before we have to buy it
most of these games are turning out to be dogs
i almost wish someone would clone world of warcraft because a mindless clone would be so much better than this garbageplayed on ghz with mb ram nvidia  video card and broadband connectionthe good its dd with close attention to the rules
graphics are good and the user interface is well designed and fairly easy to use
theres a wide selection of quests and most of them are fairly interesting
the mapping is especially good
the penalty for dying is not too harshthe bad unlike dd you only get xp for completing quests or quest objectives
there are no random encounters so you are forced to repeat the same quest multiple times to get enough xp to level up and become strong enough to face newer more challanging quests
you have to find and join groups to complete quests because most are too difficult to solo and there is no advantage to soloing no extra treasure or xp
finding a group can take a long time  together with the long login process i normally i dont get to adventure for at least  minutes after starting the program
there is an xp penalty if a member of the group is higher than the quest level
i just tried a level  quest where a level  rogue joined us for  seconds and left literally
we all suffered a  xp penalty there are also some minor problems with some of the quests
if you dont do exactly what they expect sometimes you have to start again or cant even complete the quest
i expect these issues will be resolved soonthe ugly lag
there is terrible lag as you enter new areas that can stop you from moving for up to  seconds
this is especially frustrating when youre in a dungeon being attacked and you cant respond
im sick of dying because of it
at first i thought it was my box but i managed to connect to a server shortly after it was restarted after it crashed two server crashes in as many weeks while i was playing and i had almost no lag at all so im pretty sure the problem is partially at the server endi just cancelled my subscription
im wasting too much time waiting for the gameif you are going to get battlefront get 
 is so much more confusing jedi are a complete rip off and worst of all you have to earn your characters
 is all around x better
please go to  for reviews for this game and other games tooi bought the first game and that one for ps was great
very intuitive and brining some fun things the fps games
the second eeeeehhhhh not so much
the game can get really really choppy at times and can lag pretty bad
and the space battles are raelly hard
its not like in the first one where you could fly around for three hours
you have to get your business done and fast or risk being blown out of the sky
which isnt bad but it can get frustration if you just start playing it  overall i ahve to say the pc version was much better
everything was smooth and there was none of the bugs that plagued the last version
online play is much easier to doin over if possible get this for the pc but if not its still a decent game to pick upafter great reviews about the game i bought the ps for twenty dollars at my local walmart several years ago
even though i do like the xmen ive only played this game a few time because of the bad animation and the many glitchesi bought this to play with a friend but we gave up on it after an hour or so
i was hoping for a good beatemup game with some neat moves but xmen legends ii cant decide whether it wants to be an rpg or action game
sometimes an action rpg can be fun like oblivion
but xmlii gets overly mired down in the crappy story
you wind up in a pattern fight  or  enemies then it goes to cut scenes about the uninteresting story
i really just want to beat stuff up
youre constantly finding items and powers that youre supposed to intelligently distribute we always just used auto distribute or whatever and kept on going
after all its no fun sitting around watching the other play distribute powers and itemsthe graphics arent very good the characters are fairly small the alien planet scenery isnt that interesting
sounds were decentoverall if youre looking for an action game with rpg elements and a constantly intruding storyline this game is for you
otherwise pass or just rent itthis game was fun to run through levels and destroy objects
i honestly thought i was progressing through the game for at least  hours
by the time i got to the last map in act  i realized i couldnt figure out what to do next
i spent an entire hour walking around levels i had already cleared
sometimes you have to damage items behind walls with super powers which is very confusing
the good the graphics are very nice
the characterizations are really enjoyable
the fighting is really fun
what they really screwed up on was level progression and the objectives menus
i couldnt figure them out
at the end of a few hours i gave up on this game
there is just too much text in this game
you might find yourself never playing it again after you hit a roadblock
bad pacing confusing missions and the amount of text really killed this game
it could be fun to play with family or friends for a little while
bottom line its  and i wouldnt buy this one againnice graphics and use of real life players
a lot of pretty well designed mini games
career mode is fun but could be a lot better
i do like the ability to improve your player to the top levelthe game control is okay but it feels kind of fake and limitingoverall i enjoyed this game for a week or two but after that it just seemed like the same game over and over
i had fun with the game for a little bit so gave it a  rating for funbut only a  overall rating because i expect to enjoy a game for more than a week or two
other games like golf are similar where i take a break with them but i always come back to play them because of the skill and fun
this game however i traded in for credit for other games as i never had the need to play it againbuy discounted or used if you want to just try it outbut i would recommend renting or not purchasing at allthis game isnt very goodtrying to adjust the camera angle to youre likingcan be very annoyingits tough to pick which one is just rightbecause sometimes it will be too close or sometimes it will be too far upas you control it with the right along stickthe gameplay is fairbut it can get pretty damn hard when you got a whole gang of enemies trying to kill youits tough to kill them allespecially when your health is lowand it can get very low really fastfrom the attacksi found the graphics to be pretty badi know this game was made in but i can think of games that were made before thenthat had better graphics than thisthe music is okayas it fits the whole theme of the gameif you plan to buy this gamedont pay too much for itanything over five bucks is too much for this gamei picked it up at my local video store for only two dollarsso for me it really wasnt much of a lossthese is a nice little speaker system the downfall is the place where the psp sets is a little hard to get the psp to set the psp in and still operate it it tips over so we just hook up the speakers and and dont really use the stand part  they are nice little speakersyeah so this game came out in  thats  years too late geez
it probably would have been flippin sweet back when the movie came out
this game has some pretty lackluster graphics even for ps standards
while learning the controls i never really felt like i was in control
it didnt seem to matter if i was carefully timing the moves or just button mashing as it kinda just fights the battles for you
the absolute worst part of the control scheme is the gunplay holy shizzle its bad
i mean if i had an extra hand maybe it would work
you have to hold down one button to aim another button to fire while your holding the aim button and then press another button to activate the slowmo matrix effect
thats  buttons all at the same time folks and they are all in different places  and try jumping while pressing all these buttons thats  now
did they try playing this garbage before they shipped it out
they also thought it would be a good idea to throw in tons of movie clips which we have all seen countless times yeah we get it its the matrix now let me play the game
nevermind i think ill be sending this one to the gamestop graveyard with all the other unwanted turdsthe matrix has been great entertainment for years i love the film trilogy i enjoyed the companion tales of the animatrix but more relevant i enjoyed the enter the matrix video game its a  out of 
so when i popped in this disc and eagerly awaited the next installment in this iconic worldi was stunnedconceptplayers will assume the role of neo for the entire film trilogy
half of the game revolves around key sequences morpheus rescue or neo vs agent smith
the other half includes portions that add to the overall story
for example  short tales are about neo freeing the minds of the matrixs inhabitants
gamers can improve neos abilities and powers as they progress through a simple upgrade systemgraphics  animationthe game looks solid enough but the character models arent very smooth and look a little blocky
the environments are nicely detailed but there isnt much interaction with them
the martial arts combat looks smooth but collision detection has some serious issues
the walls are destructible but the character models dont react correctly to their surroundings
try to imagine a dark gritty and unclean jade empire and you get the right ideasoundthe music doesnt stand out very much in fact it often becomes silent in the middle of cutscenes
the voiceacting isnt great but rarely is bad
the only sore spots are actually when different actors quote the movies lines
whats really strange is that when players use the focus ability the sound becomes muted and muffled
its a really annoying experience
the guns sound fine but dont have much of a punch to them
the martial arts attacks sound good but also lack much emphasis to get ones blood racingpresentationthis is the part that ticks me off the most
enter the matrix seamlessly interweaved the matrix reloaded footage with original cutscenes to create a good story
in path of neo the actual film footage is used with no cohesion whatsoever
seriously movie clips are randomly spurted like an espn highlight reel and end with a brief clip that pertains to the level youre about to play
ingame cutscenes arent too shabby but are inconsistent
some are outstanding while others are extremely weak
some of the ingame presentation reminded me of the minority report game that was released three years back
to make matters worse the focus ability which initiates bullet time gives an annoying green tint on the screen
this becomes extremely annoyinggameplaywhen compared to enter the matrix this game takes too many steps back
climbing ledges and scaling walls is difficult and useless gunshooting isnt fun and feels like it was tacked and there are even some platform exercises
the platforming isnt bad because it actually feels fresh
but the key feature is obviously the martial arts fighting
this was not done too bad
the motion capture is very good if not always timed right and doesnt feeling like youre watching it like enter the matrix
instead of combining odd camera angles like last time path of neo is a complete thirdperson adventure
the handtohand combat is inconsistent because sometimes animations cant be stopped but it is slightly fun
the problem with that however is that the the first third of the game is an introductory phase
path of neo features some of the most unenjoyable training ive ever played
only the most patient gamer will want to reach the reloaded and revolutions chaptersoveralli really hate this game
it isnt worth the dolalr asking price
i really want to like this game but when i play enter the matrix and compare it to path of neo too many steps were taken backwards
my love for the matrix stories and experiences can only propel a bad game so far
path of neo is not worth your time or patiencecritics generally panned shadow the hedgehog while gamers gave the game rave reviews for reasons i cant put my finger on
this game is awful just awful
i disliked this game greatly for a number of reasons
 it has one of the worst storylines ive ever heard
 the gameplay is imprecise and crappy
 the voiceactors are horrible
 the camera is a wretched nightmare
 the track designs are dull and boring
 the game is repetitive and slow
etc etcwhat the game is picture all the rpg cliches you can think of and then make them even worse
shadow suffers from amnesia and cant remember his past typical rpg cliche outside flashes of different memories
so he discovers that he must collect the chaos emeralds to unlock the secrets of his past while trying to decide which of the three sides of armies he must join on his journey
if you think the storyline is bad from my description wait till you actually hear it during the course of the game that is if youre foolish enough to buy this crap
the game is a mix between action platforming and some rpg elements thrown in together
if i was designing this game i would have made it d like the old genesis sonic games but thrown in the gunplay of titles like contra and gunstar heroes
that would have been a lot cooler or it would have at least been better than this messgraphics the graphics bounce back and forth between decent to hideously ugly
some of the cutscene visuals look nice but there are other cutscenes that look like they date back to the psone era with sloppy animation ugly textures and dated environmental designs
the character designs are nothing phenomenal and could have been done bettersound shadows voiceactor isnt bad but the rest of voiceactors are unbelievably bad
this game also has some of the worst dialogue ive ever heard
it ranges from laughably bad to unbearably horrible which is made worse by the fact you cant skip the cutscenes
sonic team and sega were determined to make sure you listen to their hackneyed and horrible story every second and its unbearable
and just because shadow constantly says damn every time he dies or loses rings doesnt make him cool at all hes one of the most lame protagonists ive ever seen
overall the sound just isnt that goodmusic the music is fine but one of the only good parts of this crappy experiencegameplay this is where it all falls apart
there are over  missions to unlock but i guarantee you that you will not want to play this game again after finishing it once
shadows controls are schizophrenic and unpredictable and the game glitches and terrible camera dont help
there is no reticle or a lockon shooting system in this game all you can hope is that shadow is smart enough to shoot at his enemies
you will die constantly because of the unpredictable movements and bad camera
there will be times in which you will accidentally go over a cliff and go all the way back to your last checkpoint and lose your weapon and rings
i hated the fact that your health is determined by rings because every time you touch an enemy you lose rings and if you lose them all you will die
there are lots of things to collect in the environments but chances are because of the frustration of just finishing the level you wont bother to even try at times
the game also seems to take notes from titles like star wars knights of the old republic and fable because its like moral choice between good and evil except picture a really crappy version of such a system
even if you try to take sides they will still attack you leaving you no choice but to shoot back
as you go through the levels you smash crates and kill enemies to get your guns and get other items which at least was somewhat of a highlight to this awful experience
when shadow kills enough enemies he goes through power surge reminiscent of hulk ultimate destruction except it sucks
when his meter is fully charged he can blast all the enemies in close range of him or go really fast and fly through a portion of a stage
he can also use vehicles and other forms of transportation throughout certain stages
these are among the only at least somewhat interesting parts of the gameoverall shadow seems like hes trying to emulate and take inspiration from the iconic final fantasy vii hero cloud but does a terrible job
sorry shadow youre not cool now and you never will be
your game will just die in the bargain bin only to be bought by misguided sonic fans who are convinced the series is still good and shadow is coolthe good the weapons selection driving the music and special attacksthe bad the gunplay the graphics the glitches the camera the voiceacting the horrible storyline no ability to skip cutscenes etcfirst off let me get something straight this is not a kids game
whatever the esrb was thinking they messed up bad
a game for kids  includes curse words and guns
i would understand putting that stuff into and teens game but a kids game
whoever rated this game wasnt very smart about their decision on rating the game
if you are a mom like me you would be pretty surprised to hear your son say damnfrom the beginning of the game i was confused as to what my objective was
i run into sonic who asks me to help him out and then theres some weird star shaped thing with an eye in the middle telling me to destroy the enemies
enemies 
which ones are the enemies 
it keeps cycling from helping good to bad
im guessing the game focuses on which side you wanna take  the good or the evil
every level is pretty confusing that your just gonna have to guess your way through each level
id pick something else if i knew this game wasnt very goodthis is supposed to be a good action rpg game
unfortunately the game is dominated with too many problems to really be any good
for one thing the cheapness that occurs when an enemy is attacking you
you can die very easily in this game which makes for an unentertaining experiencethe storyline is fair and the graphics are decent
but the fact that the action is so incredibly hard really hurts the game
dont botherit should be noted that shining force neo is not an rpg but a real time action adventure game
there is a lot of timing and button mashing to defeat hordes of monsters over and over again
there are countless long boring cutscene style dialogs between the characters and a less than interesting storyline
on the plus side the music is not bad and the graphics are acceptable
there are also special abilities thrown into the combat which make it a little more fun than if it were a pure beat em up such as dynasty warriors
however the item system is very convoluted and frustrating to understand it is not intuitive
if you prefer real time action adventure type games to rpg and turn based strategy games you might want to give this game a go otherwise i would have to recommend avoiding this one unless someone is letting you borrow it for freethis game does not feels or plays like a shinning force game
yes the original ones might been tactics based but it was the animated attack screens the battle music the side quest that made the series so popular
i dont like neo or new it is boring you have to read a lot and listen to the voice overs at the same time too bad
this should have been called side quest or virtua quest another big flop
i would not even rent itthe game is just boring
and considering that this is a game about a black anthropomorphic hedgehog with amnesia blasting his way through aliens thats pretty counterintuitive
let me explain
you play as shadow the hedgehog a genetically engineered creature that acts as a parallell rival and ally to sonic himself
he was introduced in sonic adventure  where at the end of the game he fell to earth from outer space
however in sonic heroes sonic team found out that shadow was somewhat of a fan favorite and brought him back
he had amnesia and at no point did anyone ask him how he survived falling thousands of miles to earth
as sonic teams response to this they made this game
and now they regret it
the games story is a complete mess partly because of a botched moral choice system that not only adds layers of tedium to the missions but forces you to play through the game  different times to get the crap ending
basically shadow seeks the aid of an alien overlord to tell him about his past and is forced to choose between finding out about who he is or protecting the ones he loves
this story turns him into an idiot as there is no given reason for him not to just ask sonic rouge or literally anyone else what happened as they all learned his past and were there for the events of sa
the gameplay is downright embarrassing with controls so slippery that they make mario  look like metroid prime
the graphics are downright laughable looking like a dreamcast title while it was released late in the th generation
the only reason im complaining is that the graphics are worse than sonic heroes the game that came before this one
actually i forgot a crucial element
in the games efforts of being edgy and cool they introduce guns hilariously out of place minor swears and motorcycles
these are all badly implemented with the main offender being guns
they are unwieldily to use and you are forced to use them as all of shadows other abilities like the homing attack and spin dash were unbelievably nerfed to put emphasis on the guns
i only bought this overrated waste of time to complete my sonic collectionim not impressed with ds
perhaps that could be because i havent played the first one but i doubt it
i havent played longer than  mins but what i did play i found boring tedious and really unpleasant upon the eye
the storyline and script is horribly canned and the visuals are far from stellar  you would think this game was a couple years old
trying to drop into it i found the controls very unfamiliar but as it is with most games i can see that once you get the format familiarized that should no longer be a problem
the game may get better with time if so i will edit my reviewthis is certainly a game i would not recommend you spend your money on until you find it in the bargain binsi have a newer graphics card and i cant say that this game impressed me very much
even though the monsters were uniquelooking there wasnt any variety in fighting them you could either hack at them with a blade or cast the same set of weak spells and then hack at them with a blade
the quests were tedious and needless to say it didnt hold my attention for long
there are many better games out there for this kind of money so keep lookingwhen the original game is a groundbreaking masterpiece its sequel rarely lives up to the unavoidable hype
there are notable exceptions of course baldurs gate ii and max payne ii spring to mind
however i have to agree with most of the other reviewers never had i been so disappointed with a sequel more than dungeon siege iifollowing the innovative and brilliant original ds the anticipation was so great that minor flaws would be forgiven
with ds though it was one big blunder after anothercontrary to the original ds for which one had to physically tear himself from the computer screen this one is a boring chore
running back and forth to the base camp to barter equipment is a tedious procedure with all the fun sucked out of it
moreover no matter how much you improve your character either leveling up or equipmentwise your enemies simply match your abilities or resort to crowding resulting in no change in the gameplay
i am not talking new enemies but arent higher leveled characters supposed to easily wipe out enemies encountered many hours before
this way the whole game is nothing but a evenleveled blandnesson a similar note why was it necessary for minor enemies to have so much life
i was bored out of my skin hacking and slashing forever
increase the damage they can cause and keep it interesting  do not give them a longer life only to artificially increase the games durationoh and the enchanting system was a joke  since the items found were much better than anything one could pay to have forgedgraphically ds is not even one step higher than the original ds
shadows and particles may have increased but characters and equipment have not
as a result the heat of the battle even on highend systems will find you in the midst of a disorientingblurthis was the chronicle of a botched job foretold
with the exception of oblivion which was an excellent game one can count on k games toruin any game franchise and kill its successful progress once and for all
gaming history is littered with the relics of their failures stronghold ii civilization  not until its second expansion did this one become a playable game sid meiers railroads  the list is endlessthey should probably stick to consolesmy advice avoid this stinker and instead try the originaldungeon siegeand its expansion
it is a much better gamei remember the good old days of doom  and how fun that was and then quake  came along and was even more fun
it was great
anyway i enjoyed the doom  demo except for the whole darkness thing  i dont want to deal with that
so i figured maybe quake  would be as good as doom  but without having to whip out a flashlight every second and shoot at things i cant see
unfortunately that isnt the case
quake  is just a pretty mediocre fps  id still rather play it than that crappy fps prey  but its not as fun as say far cry or max payne
thats about all i can say really its just not that good
i didnt really care for the multiplayer either
if you really want a good multiplayer play halflife s
people never talk about it but its funsimilar graphics better maps updated ai another set of lame weapons nice controls less demonswhen hit instead of knocking you back your vision blurs
ok surehalf a step above doom yet retaining some of the quake series feelhow similar
i would be very surprised if they do not share the same graphics enginefrankly i expected more
the new quake games used to raise the standard and serve as the benchmark of graphics and creativity
apparently not anymore
increasing the screen analysis and multiplying the hardware requirements does not a new game makeanother corporate clone following the mainstream fps trendlets hope they game publishers finally show some respect and let real game artists create something new and smart for a changetheres already a great role playing organized crime game set in the late s and early s
its called mafia and it came out four years before the godfather
mafia features better graphics more cars better voice acting more diverse missions a larger playing area and better music
this game is dull and repetive
there are a few fun things but mostly its drive here beat up or shoot a bunch of thugs and get back to your hideout or go to mr xs delisaloonrestaurantwarehouse and rough him up til he starts paying his protection money again
sandbox games have been tremendously popular with the gta and driver games over the last few years
a gamer looking for this kind of experience simply has too many options to chose from these days
dont bother with this one
some of the cutscenes which feature dialogue and scenes from the movie are fun to watch and you do get to dress up your character and change his appearance
but all in all you will become bored very quickly with thissanbox games like gta are fun because you can wander back and forth from the main storyline whenever you wish
if you dont want to advance the main story you can drive around doing side jobs or just exploring
godfather tries to recreate this but the only side jobs available are stickup and protection rackets which become boring after the first  look alikeall in all a disappointment
i played it for about two hours initially and then uninstalled itive been playing age of empires for a couple of weeks and have been largely impressed
the tutorial mode is good and the user interface is solid
since people have covered the positives in glowing detail ill delve into the negatives a bitgiven the small real estate available the interface is good
it would be nice to be able to zoom in a bit in order to get better control over your units
it would also be nice to be able to rotate the mapmy biggest gripe is the beta release quality
the game has locked up at least  times during play and about  times using the save and quit feature
majescos response to the latter problem is to save only then power off
no solutions yet to the random lockup issueim pretty disappointed in the quality of this game
we cant exactly go out and patch the cart now can weit appears that majesco is going to have to do the right thing and replace the bad cards with more stable codelike others who said their game locked up or would not restart mine did after literally  days of ownership
i played the tutorial and got to the part of the siege of  castles
while playing it froze but i was able to restart but after playing a few more minutes trying to save and quit completedly killed the gamethis game is not ready for live release the code is unstable and far too many people have had broken cardsthe use of the small screen and cramming layers of characters was nice but in the beginning it was hard to navigate and figure out how to move the units around
overall the game play is nothing like the pc version and it does require much time to playi may get another copy but something tells me i should look for another title to buyfirst let me say that the majority of madden fans are not going to like thissecond this is not i repeat not a football gameand third this review is based on the ps versionthis is my honest opinion this game is just a fancier version of nfl blitz
blitz the league is all about one thing the bonebreaking hits
stratergy dont matter
lets talk about the ps version load times not only impossibly long you arent really sure if it is doing anything
also once you made a decision to look at a feature it doesnt give you a chance to back out
you have to wait until the feature load and then you can back out which also takes a bit to load
it also takes a long while for the game to save to your memory cardand now for the game featuresif you want to play as one of the good teams the only way you can do that is in quick game
you cannot choose one of the previous made team like the nightmares and play a season with them
personally this part of the game sucks
the only option is to create a nonexisting team
once the team is created drafting uniform choices stadium choices coaches then you can start playing
the teams you go up against are superstars
they constantly go into the unleash mode and almost impossible to take them downspeaking of going into the unleash mode it is difficult to pull of as you have to hold down l and hit x and many times it does nothingoverall i can imagine the game being fun only in the head to head mode with a human but as far as single mode playing it wears thin quickly
its just that their isnt anything special about it
i also would find that younger players would have a lot of fun with this but the user of language makes this impossible to give this as a gift to anyone under   also i think anyone over  will find the game kinda boring
personally i was over this game after about  minutes of game play
its going to be a dust gatherer unless i have company over and we want a good laugh then we may put in blitz the league
not as fun as being advertisedfirst off anyone who says this game is better than madden  is a retard
its no way near as good as any madden game after   the gameplay is fun but too many flaws
first off when you create your team you dont get to pick who your players are
they pick them for you
you cant trade them or nothing
then in the middle of a game if your qb or hb is doing lousy you cant sit them out and put in new people
your stuck with them until they get injured
not to mention to make your players stats go up takes forever and you dont even have control over it
you just select what attributes you want for the player and wait forever before they get any better
plus the storyline sucks
you dont know who you are in the game
your either a player or the coach
i cant figure it out nor do i care
im stayin with maddenat first glance this game looks like quite an improvement on gauntlet dark legacy
alas it really is not in the grand scheme of things
i picked this up because of the cooperative multiplayer and the fact that it seemed to be a pretty interesting role playing game
in order to properly review this game i first had to go back and play dark legacy to see what the difference was
boy are there some huge ones
some go in the right direction but some are just horribleone benefit i will point out is that the graphics were improved upon immensely
theyre heavily detailed and actually use the xbox graphic abilities the way its supposed to be used
you dont have that major overhead view anymore and its more like playing a tomb raider third person view
however despite all this grand improvement the camera is still fixed
why they improved the graphics on a grand scale and didnt make a rotating camera is anyones guess
heres this grand lush world to look at but you can only see it from one camera view sorry
great thanks
overall it was one of the dumbest things they could have done
they also dropped the whole everyone has long ranged attack type of combat and actually had their melee characters fight like regular melee characters
sure they can get special abilitiesmagic to give them a more long distance attack but theyre not on the same level as the sorcerer
along with this added melee attack feature you can do some pretty awesome combos and basically every character has this option though naturally the sorcerers melee attacks wont be of the same strength as the valkyrie
i thought these were some pretty cool additions to the game
oh and they also fixed that pesky walking problem like i mentioned in my dark legacy review your characters no longer trip over each other when they walk next to each othersome of the things they kept the same were the way the enemies spawn
they come from those strange spawning gates and constantly keep being created until you destroy their spawn point
this is pretty awesome if you want to sit down and just kill a bunch of stuff to try and level up your characters faster
the cast of characters is mostly the same but they really did cut a lot out of this game
leveling up is loosely the same only i think its based on kills now not hits and you cant buy any nifty items from a store
there are no unlockable characters like we had in the previous game and thats one of the things that made that game kind of fun
i guess this leads me into the negativesthe absolute worst part about this game is that it took my friends and i only four hours to beat this thing
frankly this just isnt worth the money
four hours
seriously dark legacy took a long time to beat and the followup takes only four
despite the faults of dark legacy its a heck of a lot better than this given the four hour playtime
its like they spent all their time making graphical improvements and then spent twenty minutes throwing together some lame story line
yes the story line for this one is even lamer than dark legacy
at least dark legacy was overly clicheacute but this is about some emperor who took over the land and committed great evil
now he feels remorseful and the seven creatures he put in charge of the land need to be destroyed
that would kind of be cool but they do look kind of lame and nonthreatening
i dont know the real problem is this game starts out and you think its kind of fun regardless of the silly story
then you get to the end in such a short time with no major revelation that you just feel you wasted your time
i wouldve rather they designed the standard overhead modeling for the graphics and just wrote a game with a length that didnt make me feel ripped offcombined with the nonrotating camera and the ridiculously short length of the game i just cant give this my hearty endorsement
there are far superior games out there and this definitely doesnt live up to the spirit of gauntlet from what i can tell
even the maps are more confusing this time around
theres no crystals you need to find to unlock areas there are no secret areas to get into
there are just the seven sorrows and then youre done
its practically less than a single area from dark legacy what a wasted followup
the game is fun in its own right but there just shouldve been morefor many this game has been a great game throughout the years with its many versions and platforms that it ran on
then comes this new version after all this time
i will give them credit for the graphics
everything is just outright gorgeous
however i am guessing that is where they spent all of their time because the game is too easy at best
as long as you can press the fire button fast enough you breeze right throughthere are no secret passages to find
the game guides you where it wants you to go and you cannot take a wrong turn
you can purchase fighting abilities that allow you different moves but everything is so easy i found myself rarely using any of them
there were so little moves anyway with the wizard i had them all purchased within the first hour of gameply
there are no potions to buy no keys to find to open chests and so on
you literally just walk through the game pressing the a button as many times as you can
it takes nothing more than thatanyway for long time gauntlet fans i think you will be disappointed
the previous version was a little easy but what made up for that was the length of the game and all the little secret places and definately all the different characters
this version only has again the graphics are so much better but you can take a nap while playing and still be able to finish the game
yes even on the socalled hardest level
i put the game in and had all seven levels done by myself mind you in  hours and i was taking my time thinking there actually might be secret passages
the final beast is just way too easy
just run past all the creatures flip the switches several times as required and it is over just like thatgauntlet took the traditional dungeon crawl style made popular by the penandpaper roleplaying game dungeons  dragons and amped it up to an insane degree by tossing billions of monsters at four heroes from a topdown perspective
your heroes in turn were armed with medieval weaponry that they hurled at ridiculous speeds machinegunstyleive been a fan of gauntlet since the game was in the video arcades
ah the good old days of the barbarian valkyrie elf and wizard
of course no selfrespecting guy wanted to be the valkyrie becausewell because she was a girl
the elf was nearly just as bad especially when he shrieked in his prissy elf voice oh no
as he neared deathgauntlet introduced a lot of fantasy troupes that are routinely mocked today
it rationalized that when you eat food you heal
given that id prefer just sucking down a shake once a day to actually having to eat i have difficulty imagining that food actually gives you that kind of recuperative abilities
sometimes food was just sitting in some chest waiting to be discovered
other times monsters dropped it
it always looked delicious a whole chicken on a plate with potatoes a leg of pork or some smelly cheese
it never made any sense and didnt have togauntlet was also known for the dungeon master again swiped from dd providing some obvious and not soobvious commentary
my all time favorite is when the other characters accidentally destroyed food
elf shot the food
booms the dm encouraging every other player to smack them upside the head
about to die
the dm had some advice there too
wizard needs food
badly
when i get really hungry before lunch sometimes i hear that voice toogauntlet seven sorrows attempts to update the hackandslash style of the original gauntlet while at the same time providing the rationale for the characters ridiculous kill em all let the dm sort em out style of mass murderour heroes are immortals crucified 
by some kind of azteclooking sun emperor
his seven advisors all turned out to be wretchedly evil
since the heroes are immortal they didnt die and now we know why they keep coming back to life each gameit all makes sense now
filled with regret the emperor taking the role of the booming dm voice guy guides our heroes along the path to redemption by encouraging them to kicking the living snot out of his former employeesa lot of thought went into seven sorrows
the generators that spawn dozens of monsters are still there but they create enemies with a magical flourish
the environment is beautifully rendered in three dimensions allowing enemies to be knocked right off precipices my favorite tactic
in addition to all the running and the killing there are occasional quests where our heroes go and kill more monsters find a key then run back to the door and open it
gauntlet was never a deep gameeach hero has been updated with a wide variety of moves including magical powers that replace the potionbombs from the original gauntlet
the elf can stun enemies the valkyrie shrieks and tosses bad guys into the air etc
each hero has a logical ranged weapon too the valkyrie shoots energy lances from her blade the elf pulls out his bow and fires the barbarian hurls hand axes and the wizard shoots bolts of energy
all four heroes are highly individualized the valkyries jump back maneuver is actually a series of backflips while the wizard teleports all over
overall the graphics are impressiveunfortunately seven sorrows is far far too short
my wife and i have come to the conclusion that we are now advanced players so starting a game on normal difficulty no longer suffices
we should have set it on hard but didnt in retrospect im not sure if that would have helped
we ended up beating the game in the span of just a few hoursits ironic that seven sorrows is probably most like the original gauntlet game
thats not a compliment though in a crowded market of gauntletclones seven sorrows doesnt sufficiently distinguish itself from all the other swordswinging axehurling bowshooting magicblasting games out therejust adding my voice to the many reviewers who have already said it this game is too short and the gameplay is too monotonousa friend and i completed this in just a few hours
thats not worth the graphics are fantastic
i enjoyed walking around the levels just to see the intricate layouts and cool effects in the backgrounds
curiously the cut scenes were pretty poor
i guess all of the development went into level designit is clear that each level was painstakingly designed by hand
that is almost certainly the problem
although this leads to beautiful scenery it meant the developers couldnt afford to make the game bigger or longer
i think most of us playing the game would have given up some of the handtuned beauty if the developers could have gone for more of a buildingblock approach like most other games like this on the marketavoid buying this one new
if you can find it used for around  take a look at the graphicswhen it comes to third party developers bringing established franchises to the ds they either utilize just what the ds can do very well they completely ignore what the ds can do or they make a sloppy attempt at kind of taking advantage of what the ds can do
the long running guilty gear series considered by many to be the best d fighting series on the market in the past few years makes its debut on the ds with guilty gear dust strikers and it does the aforementioned three things that third party ds games tend to do
utilizing both of the ds screens for fighting mayhem dust strikers moves the games traditional one on one fighting format into an all out four player free for all and its not for the better
thanks to an unbalanced fighting engine and the games haphazard use of the dual screens the fighting action becomes nothing but one big messy button masher
not to mention that for a guilty gear game there is hardly as much depth to it as weve seen before on other editions of the series
theres also some lame minigames thrown in for good measure using the stylus and touch screen which are hardly worth even checking out
there are a few good points to dust strikers though the character sprites and graphics and animation look crisp clean and sharp most of the time
plus theres a heaping amount of fighters to pick from which is a nice plus for longtime fans of the series and of course theres a rocking soundtrack to boot as fans would come to expect although it does sound a bit grainy coming through the ds small speakers
its sad that majesco just had to tamper with a winning formula for dust strikers and its even more disappointing at how messy it all turned out
longtime fans may want to give it a look everyone else can leave it on the shelfmortal kombatsure its neat that they have the good movies etc
and the background etc
has been developed quite nicely but you have to unlock everything in this game
i mean everything
you only have liukang and kung lao to start with for either single koop or vs you have to unlock the other characters for vsyou also have to unlock all the characters abilities from their combos to their special abilities by defeating enemies and getting exp points aha so its a rpg like xmen legends you say
plus you can get other special special abilities such as wall run swing etcthe best part is the interaction of the environment and all the fatalities to choose from
very gory good funits a shame that you cannot pick from more characters to do the story and if youre playing koop you cannot continue with just one character you need both players to continue
so you pretty much need two games going to be able to finish the game
you cannot unlock everything with just one player either there are special things that require koop to completewhile its fun to work with a buddy on koop its not available online and you have to work together
if an enemy is outside the current area of the sceen you have to wait for your friend to move enough to be able to attack it
this becomes extremely annoying when trying to unlock things and requiring an enemy to do sooverall its a fun game and will take a long time to play and get everythingthis game could have been good if they had taken more care with it and spent a few more months in development
it has almost no depth as there are no items to buy and exp is used soley to buy small move improvements
the voice acting is awful and ruins any sense of atmosphere
the graphics are lazy and the models are blocky and not lifelike
it also takes hardly any time to complete
coop mode is better and more fun so its not all bad newsthere are far better games to spend your money onthe idea of the mortal kombat coop really excited me as my son loves all the games however it just didnt feel right
the controls were weird game looked bluh and overall it was just boringthis game isnt sid meiers ninjas
i just have to accept that and review that game i actually played instead the potential awesomeness i couldve played
in opposition to the pc version the xbox version has some hastily tackedon plot something about having to save your family from an evil baron
like im sure everybody else did i choose to ignore all that in lieu of terrorizing the frenchyou may remember that sid meier is responsible for the insanely addicting civilization iii
pirates
is a bit of a change of pace in terms of scope  instead of overseeing the fate of an entire civilization for several thousand years youre limited to taking charge of a single pirate crew in the caribbean from the mid to lates
since most pirates never got past the wizened age of  this makes sense
after naming your captain and choosing a proficiency most would choose to improve their dueling prowess but i choose wit and charm for more effective wooing youre given control of a small shipsailing around and just randomly attacking passing boats can be highly amusing if not totally broken
case in point i was in my insignificant sloop when i saw the queen annes revenge sail right on by
channeling my inner johnny depp i decided to go in for the kill
outgunned and severely outmanned i knew the first volley of  cannonballs in opposition to my three would knock me right out of the water
instead i found myself to be unharmed
i then did what any completely insane pirate would dobashed my pathetic heap of timber against the legendary shiponboard was the fearsome blackbeard flaming beard and all
after a suprisingly easy game of simon says that required all of three button presses i had slain the most fearsome pirate on the high seas and taken his ship
if that isnt evidence of a game in need of balancing id like to know what is
speaking of blackbeard my dad is writing a miniseries all about him
check it out
thats basically an apt description for the entire experience an abundance of strung together minigames
youve got the dancing to win the affections of the governors daughter game which i prefer to think of as virtual finger torture
other examples include the laying siege to a city pseudorts and the sneaking into a hostile area stealth portion
needless to say playing gets to be repetitive in a big hurrybottom line im not saying you wont be highly amused for a couple of hours
quite the contrary
once the novelty wears off though im afraid you might come to the same horrified realization that i did
youre just playing the illegitimate child of a mario party gameits a good game overall but the fight scenes are kind of lame
the multilayer is really cool with your friends
the best thing about it is that its one of the backwards compatible games for the xbox  so you can play it on both consolespirates
would have been good about  years ago
but the graphics are subpar the gameplay is terrible swordfights are basicly a series of a a a x a a a the story is hokey and you spend most of your time doing missions which are carbon copies of the mission you just finished the ship battles require more luck than actual talent and the trade system is flawed
ive enjoyed meiers games since the beginning when he relased the original civilization but this game if very lacking
i did get about  hours of gameplay out of it but that was becaus i was waiting for something cool to happen and it just never camedont bother purchasing anything with the camera  camera is just yucky and not a good thing
i think there are better things out there now to purchasewhat is wrong with you people
this game is a shameless pointless ineffectual ripoff of the onimusha series
i bought this game after reading the rave customer reviews only to be gravely disappionted
ill give it full points for beautiful graphics but the combat is only barely better than buttonmashing you only get one magic ability which is almost impossible to use unless you have the reflexes of an actual ninja and the bossbattles in the later stages of the game go beyond challenging to just frustratingly hard
if this genre appeals to you play the onimusha games theyre far better
if youve already played the whole onimusha series either rent this game out of mindless boredom or spend your money on something less boring
i just dont understand why everyone raves about this game its a shameless ripoff of the onimusha series but its not even remotely as much funconsidering its a cod game its main focus is the war aspect of it and what is going on throughout the game as this aspect covers it
anyway the online multiplayer is okay and is pretty much the main reason why anyone plays a cod game the onfoot fps controls are okay and u cant sprint in this game which is stupid
what is also stupid is the fact that the controls for the tank that u control is horrible
also there really isnt much to this game as well as the fact that the fact that the infinite ammo cheat doesnt work at all
anyway this game is boring in my opinion and doesnt really interest meif   stars was an option that would be my rating
im a world war  buff so i enjoyed the realism and historical basis of this game but overall its just a basic decent game to get your shooter fix
its an older game yet i was still impressed with the graphics and gameplay
my main complaint is that it gets boring
it lacks variety and it didnt grab my interest enough to make me want to play it for very long stretches of time
i was rarely itching to play it the way ive been with other shooters
of course part of the problem is that im used to playing such greats as bioshock halo  gears of war and cod
call of duty  certainly isnt as good as cod but i only paid  for a brand new copy of this game and at that price or less its probably worth the moneythere are good firstperson shooters out there
those shooters contain a story that captivates the player enough to blast through a dozen or so levels of shooting dodging and grenadelobbing
those levels generally have multiple objectives that are varied from bombing a structure to rushing a certain location and killing everything from point a to point b while staying alive
those shooters are generally accompanied with attractive graphics and pulsepounding music
the xbox  version of quake  doesnt have many of those qualities
its not a terrible game but its one of the least impressive shooters ive played this yearin quake s brainless campaign youll strap on the armor of the space marine matthew kane a member of the rhino squad that is attacking the evil strogg on their home planet
the biomechanical beasts are foul dirty and ruthlessand a small twist near the middle of the game will show you and corporal kane just how dirty the strogg can be
i thought that it was nice for raven to throw in a truly unexpected story twist but i never really found the rest of the game to be very interesting
at least the second half of the campaign is fast frantic and intense
its preferable to the first half
overall the game is about  hours long clocking in at or near the shooter averageits the gameplay that had me let down and shaking my head
quake  plays like a good first person shooterfrom  the fragging is so ridiculously generic from the start of the game until the very end
some will say its just quakes traditional gameplay i say its boring
youll pick up progressively stronger and better guns but at the same time your enemies get a little faster a little bigger an a little more deadly
theres a balance established between strong weapons and strong enemies
however most of the action consists of running forward throughout similar rooms finding the strogg and shooting them until they fall over and their corpses disappear
they dont move around much at all they often dont even try to evade your fire and they dont try to outsmart you in the slightest bit
usually theyll stand in place move towards you and shoot you without taking much cover or attempting to get around you for an easier kill
a few of the enemies have different tactics but these tactics are usually just slight variations from the standandshoot or runandslash strategy
its disappointing when games like call of duty  have such impressive intelligencethe guns you get can be pretty cool but i discovered that almost anything can be killed quickly and effortlessly with a few wellplaced shotgun blasts or an entire clip of machine gun ammo even near the end of the game
the enemies dont take much cover which is an example set for the playerrunning around and mindlessly shooting doesnt have many repercussions because it isnt necessary to hide very often
because of this even inexperienced gamers can plow through this games action
if you have to play through this game play it on a hard difficulty setting unless you simply want to cruise right on through it
the only things that break up the action even the slightest bit are a few vehicular distractions which are admittedly a lot of fun
one of them puts you on the back of an onrails truck shooting off the strogg with your own weapons
the next throws you into the cockpit of a hovering tank where you can quickly fire off missiles and pound the opposition with machine gun fire
the most exciting and last vehicle is the walker which can use lockon missiles and machine gun fire to rapidly take down enemies
these distractions are a lot of fun and its a shame that the rest of the game is so genericmultiplayer on and offline isnt any more interesting than the singleplayer
what should have been a robust fastpaced frantic set of games turns out to be pretty dull and generally unexciting
eight people can join up in a single game and of course you can frag each other in deathmatches but there isnt anything here that impressed me in the slightest bit
all these years ive heard about how much fun quake can be in terms of multiplayer and im let down by gameplay that simply isnt interesting
not to mention xbox live is very inconsistent and the alreadylow frame rate which ill mention momentarily makes quake  more frustrating to play than it ever should have beenvisually it is very difficult to classify quake  there were certain parts during the game that i was admittedly impressed with ravens choice for art and style
there is a lot of detail throughout the environments from bloodsplattered walls to gears and mechanisms scattered around the various rooms
even the nicelylit interior locations which compose most of the game are interesting
corridor shooting isnt nearly as repetitive when the bulk of the graphical factor isnt stale and boring
on the other hand player models are very generic and almost every marine looks like his partners
one marine might have different hair and another might have a different skin color
the models also look so jagged without a highresolution screen that it appears they have spikes or fur
quoting a friend quake  has cactus graphics
the effects are extremely dull whether its the nintendo calibur muzzle flash or the fire and smoke effects that would look at home in a generic playstation  game
the music isnt very good either
where perfect dark zero set a mood with its tunes quake  does nothing to pump the player up for any battle or confrontation
its not epic its not exciting and it fails to impress me at all
the voice acting is alright but the dialogue is so cliched and generic that it cancels out any sort of impressing aural qualityoverall quake  is a big disappointment
what was supposed to be a visually stunning fastpaced pulsepounding shooter ends up being one of the most dull launch titles on the xbox  the story is interesting enough to pull you through  hours of generic and brainless action and the vehicular distractions are a quick and effortless blast but thats about the furthest quake  goes
if youre a quake fan i wouldnt question you if you rented the game but id have to frown down on anyone who decides to buy this game
there isnt enough here in terms of depth or new modern shooter attractions
pick up perfect dark zero or call of duty  instead
believe me you wont regret itthis game collection of sonic is not that fun
its full of old games with very poor graphics and sound
i bought this game for my kids and they dont enjoy it very much they almost never play with it
if you really love sonic then there are other games better than this
dont lose money and time with this gamei gave this disc a rental and was extremely disappointed with the content
the six game gear titles are an automatic waste of space and sonic r and sonic the fighters are decent for archival value but dont really hold anything that will keep players coming back for more
sonic cd is actually quite fun but time travel function aside its not terribly different from the early sonic games which can be found on the sonic mega collection
you can unlock the old vectorman games as well and they do add a bit more value to this packageif youre looking for classic d sonic gaming the mega collection is the compilation to check out
hardcore fans will like what sonic gems has to offer but the content is too dated and shallow to recommend to anyone elsei read several of the reviews about this game and got suckered into shelling out sixty bucks for it
it is ten levels long  six bucks a level
it takes only a day to beat it
the graphics are excellent but game play is too slow and boring
they at least could have given us another serial killer to hunt down after you catch serial killer x to make another ten levels or so
but then again this game is so slow and boring it wouldnt hold your attention for twenty levels  youd be selling it on amazon just like im going to do after i write this
this game just doesnt have much going for it other than being prettytheres alot a horror games but this game to me is stupidbut it could have been a good game the story aint bad the play of it sucks if you want a good horror game try dead space  or  or dead island or resident evil before you wast hours an your money on this gameplease you have been warned buy an play at your own riskfirst off i realize these reviews should focus on the game not a persons personal opinions of larger moral issues
i have never been a big fan of slasher type movies and find it a little disturbing how many such movies one sees on the shelves of a place like blockbuster video
i just wonder why so many people find such things pleasant to watchi do however like to play survival horror games because the environments are so tense and being in the center of action in such a game can be very entertaining
this game certainly has that
the environments are outstanding and the combat is pretty fun
it also has an interesting story line and the character development is good
the music also fits the mood just right
i have played quite a few games of this type and dont think i am overly squimish
however there is some stuff in this game that is just over the top in terms of human suffering and torture
perhaps i am being a hypocrite by critisizing it in such a way when i bought it and will probably finish it but it does make me wonder what people really value in our societyif you like these type of games this is one of the best you will find but please dont play it around childreni bought this game after reading all the good reviews but i cant see how it got rated so high
this game had potential if the story stayed about serial killer and didnt drift off so far
the enemy stays the same through out the game except for the end boss
your weapon selection sucks which mostly leaves you fighting with a board  nail or lead pipe because ammo cannot be collected so guns run out fast and have to be discarded
not as fun as i hoped and i would not recommend this game to anyonei didnt really like this game i guess if you like all the other sonics this is basically the same nothing different
i remember liking sonic when i was little but now it doesnt seem like theres a point
you just always press the right arrow and sonic runs and you just watch him run for like every level well ive only tried the first two before i became bored but im quite sure thats how the rest of the levels gothis game is apparently all about speed
sure ill give it that but nothing else
every time you die in this game itll be because you didnt memorize the stage
youll suddenly stumble into a platforming area from the usual hispeed pointless loops with no warning
seriously its not difficult per se just annoyingly cheap
once you memorize the stage its easy peasy but who in the right might wants to do that
the enemy placement is total bogus as well
with as fast as sonic moves and how small the ds screen is not even a drag racers reaction time is good enough for this game at times
youre going to pile into enemies and lose your rings a lot
with the castlevania titles new super mario brothers and yoshis island  which i didnt particularly enjoy dont bother with this one
it stinks
also the audio quality
the music is okay
the sound effects are worse than most nes titles possibly some atari  titles
theyre low bitrate crackly audio catastrophes
stealing the original genesis sound effects would have been much much better
that and someone needs to cram a sock in tails mouththis is the only review ive ever felt obligated to write because i regret purchasing this game that much
its absolute garbagewhen i first got this game i was expecting to be very easy 
but it was wrong it was extreamly hard and frausrating as it can be  its just like playing a poratable version of sonic heroes the characters go friggin fast which makes it easy for caution mistakes  and thats just not fair at all but ill get back to the difficulty later on in this reviewgameplay it couldve been better though  the buttons are just so hard to control  i just think sonic team only made this game for people with smart skills its just so hardsound the voice acting is annoying in this game for some reason 
its mostly annoying when im being frausrated with a certain area in this game music now it does have some catchy tunes in there  but its just not fun to here them while youre being frausrated with the game the game is just so hard  and i only got  chaos emeralds the th special stage is just impossible to beat  and i been stuck on this carnival level ever since december and im even stuck on it with blaze im just losing all hope in knowing im gonna beat the beat when im not  but the game couldve been better if they just made it easybut if you like challenging games then this is the game for yougraphics are bland and there is little detail in most areas
i feel things just dont flow together at all either
the story seems very choppy
i search each map extensvely and sometimes there is just nothing there at all why bother having huge area with nothing in it
the music gets very tedious after awhile everytime an enemy approaches you get the same annoying music
i expected a graphical and musical extravaganza but received mediocre graphics and sound
i guess i just expected more
dungeons are very aggrivating until you figure out what to do
i just dont see the fun in this game and thats unfortunate since im a fan of the zelda series and it feels as this game was rushedback in the early s sega was releasing these consoles the x and sega cd
its a rip off
the thing is huge and weighs a ton also its just too much
the thing sits next to the genesis and makes it seem bigger messier and physicaly unpresentable
best of all it needs its own power adapter
i dont recomend this model
if you own a model one genesis you should get a model one cd addon it sits on the bottom so it doesnt take up as much space
the thing itself may be crap but i never said the games werent goodburnout just destroyed all the chances of me ever being satisfied with car games but come on this game was garbageatari fans had big hopes when atari scored the home console rights for pacman
pacman debuted on the atari  in late  sales were very strong but fans were disappointed in the overall product with its very poor graphics constantly flickering ghosts the wonk sound pacman made when he ate a video wafer the bleeps and bloops when paccy ate a ghostpower pelletspecial treat the weird layout of the maze and the notorious and infamous pacman death scene sound effect
atari proved that the  could have a good pacman game the next year with ms pacman but pacman on the atari  was the beginning of the end of ataris reign as the video game kingswith games like halflifefear and far cry out there trl just cannot compete
for god sakes upgrade the graphics engine
this game look little differnt than all the previous ones
and the controls are god awful tooi was at first very impressed with the great graphics and the interaction with the beautiful scenerybut the main problem with this game is the rd person camera view
you are stuck with it
after an hour of playing i got tired of the unreliable camera angles
so many times you try to make your character lora make certain smart moves only to wind up with the dumb camera engine deciding that it is best for to view a closeup of loras hair
i only wish that was a joke
other times it is ok but only because im a guy
for example ill figure out a puzzle then almost complete it when the dumb camera engine decides that it is best to view a closeup of loras 
yeah its a nice one but it ruins the flow of the gamei hope next time they give a first person camera engine to this gameby the way  what is the deal with half of these reviews that give this game  stars
they sound like they are just promotions from the company that made the game
if you work for or have a vested interest in the company that made this game that is one thing
but if you are typing in an advertising sales pitch in your review cut that out
the graphics in this game are great but the game play is just average or below average
the camera angles are so random that it ruins what would otherwise be a great game
oh that and the ai of the enemies that just stand there while you shoot at them
the ai is also way below averagei bought this game because at the time there were no new games for the xbox at the time that i thought were worth spending  bucks on
dark watch had so much hype online in magazines and in stores that i thought id get it bad mistake
the game is fun for  minutes then it becomes clear that each level will be the same as the last and this will continue to happen
it is so repetitive that the game could be playing the previous level with a new name and i would have believed it
each level involves shooting a skelton zombie or banshee in the head with a very small amount of guns fun at first then a pisser after
it starts off as a small challenge but once you get hang of the controls and get good at shooting the enemies in the headquickest way to kill them it becomes a synch
i beat the game in  hours no joke
then i looked around the options to see if there is anything else to do there was none
pissed off that i had just spent  bucks on this games i put it in the case and havnt touched it sincepros fun for  mins decent graphics origional story linecons disgustingly repetitive lack of cool guns way too short and easydont get it and if your thinking of renting try another gamewithout injecting my personal views on race or using  cent as the scapegoat for why we cant achieve world peace allow me to tell you what keeps this game yes its merely a game people from being any good
bulletproof was half assed from the graphics to the controls to just about anything else that matters
the first thing to jump out at me was the horrible storyline
the targeting is somewhat difficult but once you get the hang of it it isnt that bad
the overall experience was just okay for me  nothing outstanding but nothing so astoundingly terirble that it forces you to contemplate suicide
trust me youve played games that are a lot worsesomething tells me that these whiners have played games where theyve done some shooting
hell these guys probably love the grand theft auto series and thats probably one of the most violent series ever
basically because the character of this game has a famous face everyone wants to chime in with their opinions when half of them arent even gamers
whining about him being in this game is like whining about cj being the lead character on gta san andreas
its both pointless and somewhat corny
video games movies music and most other forms of popular entertainment have heavy amounts of violence
 isnt the first to cash in on it and he most certainly wont be the last
dont sit here and behave as if  cent had a hand in the graphics or the controls
those mishaps where handled by vivendi universal
im almost  positive of that yet i dont see anyone slamming vivendi for their shortcomings or involvement
i have an idea why dont we all go slam jet li since his game sucked too
oh waitjet li isnt a gangsta rapper like  cent hell if you know anything about hip hop then you know he isnt even that anymore so i guess theres no need
but hes just as violentand the spotlight reviews couldnt be more wrong
dorrie wheeler almost never knows what shes talking about
also the african american community has plenty of good role modelsbut the good ones dont get this kind of press which is why tavis smiley is on pbs instead of cbs
positive role models simply are not considered newsregardless of race
besides role models are for followers
do you think leaders go around modeling themselves after someone else
once youre strong enough to stand on your own merits and opinions you should be your own role model
if youre a kid look to your parents first if you have to look to anyonenot these sheep
and if youre a parent dont let the tv teach your kidsthats for you to doand to those of you whining about cashing inisnt that the american way
i swear the contradictions im reading here are astoundingbulletproof is not the godawful game these guys want you to think it is
its not exactly great but not the worst ive ever seen
its somewhere between mediocre and decent
it has its strong points and its weak points but if you like shooters then this is for you
my only knock on the game is that it wasnt put together very well
the graphics are questionable and the storyline is aimless
im not a gunit cent fan but i wont participate in the gunit witch hunt either
there are more than enough people on that bandwagonthis game could have been fun
after getting to kazakhstan all was good until you miss the train and this is where they totally missed the boat
the motorcycle sequence is entirely to long and drug out
i was running flat out for some  mins
until i had to pause for a break
if you dont you will crash in time
it is the second leg where the suvs come into the mix that is neverending
i guess there may be an end but if you got to do that for an hour or more than it is too long and makes the game not worth playing as yyou get stuck there and can progress no further and this in the easy mode too
i gave it three stars as it was fun up to that point
i only gave it two stars for being and incomplete game
underworld was so much better
yes there was a motorcycle sequence but you knew where the start was and where the end was
i guess the objective is to get to your next thing on the train
you cant jump from the bike to the train
i did find the cutoff and wrecked at the next checkpoint
this is where the long ride to nowhere comes in
i guess that part is fun if you like shooting a lot of guys on bikes and in suvs with a machine gun while trying to dodge trees and rocks
ok for a time but there needs to be an end
as i said i was running full out for  mins then hit the pause button and rested as my forearm was getting sore from holding down the x button
got back at it again
hard to stay that intensely focused for that length of time
in short they made that sequence entirely too longdont buy this game
why
read my review
i got this game and i was so excited i played it and replayed it
but then it quickly subsided and i got over it then i thought back on my experience
what i thought was a great game turned out to be nothing more than a cheap cop outfirst ill start with the goodprosthe controls were much improved over previous games i actually got lara to do what i wanted her to do most of the time
unlike tr anniversary lara went left when i wanted her to go left and she jumped where i wanted her to jump
i had some frustrating bits where she wouldnt do what i wanted but thats fine
it just says that the controls for this game need a little more tweakingthe voice acting was superb on all fronts
i especially loved laras voice and never got tired of hearing itthe camera could have been better
i really wish i could swivel the camera so i could see where lara was to leap without dying
sometimes i could this sometimes i couldnt
i dont want there to be a sometimes
still i think the good outweighs the badi loved the headset
the frequent chatter from zip and alister was funny and great except the cussing which i hated
too bad its not gonna be in the sequal sighthe graphics were great even on this system
not as good as anniversary in my opinion but still very good
the environments were as usual very beutiful
and thats saying something on this console system
not that the ps is bad but with the next generation that is ps and xbox  the ps really has to work hard to impress
and impress me it did and i dont even own a ps my parents do though
there are many outfits to unlock and use some are cool but some i wish were never used both in game and as unlockablesneat
lara now has a personal light source that you can turn on and off
somewhat useful even though i only used it when i had to which wasnt very much as i could see most of the time
still a nice feature
the grapple is back which i loved in anniversary
the bonoculars were cool but see the cons section for more on this partcroft manor is back once again and its seen some changes
i love playing through this section its a nice little distractionwith that onto the badwhile i like croft manor the inability to replay the level has been removed forcing me to start a new game just to play it all over againthe bonoculars although cool were useless
the rad mode allowed you to spot objects you could break move or do something with
why
the objects themselves could easily be seen without this so it made the bonoculars pretty much useless in the game and i hardly ever used it aside from the cool factorin tr anniversary i was fighting against lions bears rats bats strange atlantean creatures and even dinosaurs
your enemies in this game
only two with the exception of two bosses
humans and leopards
thats it
i was very disappointed with the enemies in this game
far too many humans and not nearly enough animals not to mention not enough diversity among the types of enemies you have
even the human enemies have only two types
what was cd crystal dynamics easier just to say cd thinking
i want variety not the same exact thing level to level
to add insult to injury they werent very challenging i could easily dispatch a group of enemies even large groups while losing very little health
if i had to fight  enemies at once in anniversary id sweat a little because the enemies were tougher in that game
they got angry and would charge at you to deliver a good amount of damage on you if you didnt react fast enough
in this one just too easy and no challenge thus no funthe levels themselves were too obvious
way to many shiny objects in the game to point out move this move that activate this activate that
which proves my point about the bonoculars
why have the rad mode if you can spot a shiny object clear as day
the puzzles were disappointing as they mostly consisted of placing something on pressure plates to get something to open or simply finding a lever and pulling it to advance further on
not a lot of imagination was put into these puzzles and i was disappointed again
not only that there werent very many in any one level to begin with if there was just shows how terrible they werei felt like this game was nothing more than assault courses for lara to go through
little challenge and far too much repitition
nothing brain teasing about the enemies or puzzles
the driving portions were pointless as all you had to do was shoot and drive
thankfully there is only two in this game
to add yet another insult to injury the levels themselves were far too short
this coming from me who likes exploring every nook and cranny of every level i go on
and to add double insult to injury there is only  short levels in this gamethe story was good some bad parts in it but it was good
however it left much to be desired which is why i put it here in the cons section
the bad far outweighs the good in my opinion
why
i wont spoil anything for you so lets just say that it left many questions unanswered and ended way too quickly
dangling plots unresolved doesnt sit well with me especially considering that cd could have finished the story all in the same game
and considering how short the game is its insulting to us players not to have made more levels to answer these questionsthe japan level was not needed in this game at all
this is tomb raider not james bond and dont even get me started on what she was wearing in that level
the level where you have to go to a labratory was also not needed again this is tomb raider not james bond or true lies
i want to see lara exploring tombs not going through buildings and on rooftops as if shes some secret agentthe very last level was not needed as all you do is confront the main boss you dont get to explore first and conquer puzzles to get to the main boss like in anniversarylara herself looks great but what she wears falls very flat
why the change from the classic look
and i thought her classic look was too skimpy
this new look for lara is even skimpier and i hate it
uggh
brown
showing off her legs as well as her belly button and to add insult to injury showing her cleavage
doube uggh
i like women very much they are beutiful
but when a woman dresses like this esepcially an archeologist i hate it i despise it and crystal dynamics should know better
id understand if lara was a super model which she could very easily be if she chose to but shes not shes an archeologist
have some dignity cd put some actual clothes on her
man am i glad for the outfit option in the game
so if youve read this far into my review i say again
dont buy this game
its not challenging at all far too much repitition puzzles are not challenging enemies are not diverse enough and its way too short
save your money for for a better gamei can safely say that i wont buy this game after renting it
the graphics are nice the sound is nice and the createplayer option is nice but the gameplay is extremely frustrating and the commentators are very rude and insultingi have played many golf games over the past years and i can say with confidence that tiger woods  is the worst and most frustrating that i have played to datenote to tiger woods game designers this game is horrible and tedious
i woul drather have  courses than time wasted on new mechanicsnote to gamers this golf game takes all the pains of rpg level grinding everquest et al and places them into a golf game
now you must grind out over a hundred hours of play literally  no kidding before you can ever drive the ball to the fairway with decent regularity
i played for  hours and got my power skill up to  squares and couldnt drive the ball to most fairways
i felt like i wasted my timeputting is ok but iron play is horrible unless you have put in the level grind
dont bother using irons from the rough
 yards maxi was hitting  on most courses playing my heart out
another annoying feature is that when you play crappy in the first round of a tournament the others players get dramatically worse in the second round
if the leader shot a  in round  and you shot a  the leaders will shoot in the s in round  this feature is really silly and unrealisticthis game was so boring
the puzzles were stupid
the setting was interesting and could be a learning experience but the game itself was just so bad and very short
certainly not worth the moneyif you like games such as black mirror myst atlantis etc you will be very disappointed with this gamei love the ps and i still play the one i have now but the one that im reviewing here was junk
stopped working in less than a year
it definitely was not abused or used in a sparsely ventilated area
sony customer support was terrible
newer versions seem to work much betterps does not support some hd audio format
dtshd is not supported by ps
ps cannot output bit stream of dolby truehd to av receiver
be aware of the audio format and ps specification if you are serious about real hd experiencei dont care what good might come of the ps  right out of the box you get nothing but trouble
lets start with the backwards compatability
i cant use my ps  games on this thing
oh lets see if you dont have a  hd tv you cant play with this system
lets not forget about the blue tooth controllers that stop working   minutes after you start using them
and there wont be any wired controllers anytime soon
looks like sony rushed this out untested to get people to shell out the big bucks prior to christmas
the fixes for these issues and many more are still up in the air
the sad thing is a few people were shot and killed near my home over a ps  and lets be honest its not worth  and its surely not worth a life
the graphis engine is a let down as well
dont think its better than the  it isnt now and never will be
the only thing you get out of this that i found useful is the blue ray player
trouble is what happens when hd becomes the dominant brand and blueray goes away
too much up in the air for a system that had a year of hype and way too much cash for something that doesnt work the way it should
would you buy a  car and take it without wheels or an engine
think think some more and then buy with cautionif ever there was proof of sonys hubris it was both the inclusion of bluray technology in this system and the outrageous price of 
bluray is not the industry standard with hddvd still threatening to take the market of next generation video
to include a technology that may be outdated within a handful of years especially one this expensive is ludicrous
likewise the  price tag
if there was something sony understood for the first two iterations of the playstation it was that price dictates success
the first two systems were competitively priced to compete
what the hell happened
with a  xbox and a  wii exactly how is playstation competing
sony claims they have original content and better specs but ive seen the comparisons
the graphics of games on both the  vs the playstation  have shown only minor differences with the  sometimes having the better graphics despite the lower specs
likewise sony doesnt have much original content which isnt also on the  and sometimes even the wii
also when comparing the wii to the playstation  graphics are not the sticking point but style
wii has created a new niche and original playstyle whereas playstation  is more of the samesony literally believes it can coast on the success of two prior systems
atari believed they could coast on their library of games forever which is why that company eventually crashed and found itself replaced by nintendois playstation  worth the money
no
the xbox  has virtually the same library at half the cost wii offers exclusive original entertainment for a quarter of the price and both have broad third party support something sony has seen beginning to wane as their sales have slowed
if you have the money go ahead and buy
but this system is the beginning of the end for sony unless they either create a less expensive version remove bluray
or somehow garner better exclusives
metal gear and final fantasy arent enough especially since metal gear has been appearing more and more on other systems give it a year after release and i guarantee there will be a porti gave the ps three weeks sell me on the system and sony failed
not only did they fail but they failed miserably
here are the reasonsi own an hddvd player and after comparing the movies and the players hddvd blu the sony out of the water
i compared superman returns in both format and the hddvd version at p is much clearier less graining and more crisp then the blu ray version
the ps takes forever to load the movies and the system is terribly loud while playing games and watching movies
i had to turn the volume up in order to not hear the system runningnext is the internet service available
yes many would say this sounds cool but i actually couldnt stand it
the interface is absolutely terrible and searching was difficult
i actually got so frustrated that after the first day of owning this machine i never attempted to get on the internet via the ps againonline gaming isnt terrible but it isnt great either
i have verizon fios so speed is not an issue with me but connections with the server were constantly happening
ps online seemed disorganized and jus tnot as funa nd user friendly as xbox livethe controller is notrious
i cant believe sony is still using this  year old piece of junk
it feels light and flemsy and i was just begging for an xbox  controllerthe system over heated on me twice
i dont have to add anything else to that
i was pissedi played  different games and was not impressed with the graphics of any of them
resistance is pretty nice but fight night  and ultimate alliance are actually not as well made as the  counterparts
especially fnseveral other factors such as blu ray being  dollars more a disc than hddvd the system costing so much money and other things made me take this dud back to walmart to sit with the other dozen units still sitting on the shelvesi bought the ps for a blu ray player
out of the box my ps makes such a bad whining noise i could not bare it
there are quite a few people on posting boards with the same issue
it is not the fan but the actual processors
i am sending it back to sony for repair but they are sending me a refurbished ps in return
not happy about this at all
i did not drop down  for a refurbished systemfortunately for sony history tells us that a game consoles success is based largely on the games available for it
the ps has an excellent lineup of launch titles this year and plenty of good games to come next year so on that alone you may want to buy one and theres nothing wrong with thatmy problems with ps and my reason for a two star rating has to do with the technology itself
sony isnt withholding information but there are details they arent telling you
that truth can be found in what weve seen in these first run ps games and facts about consumer electronics in general
perhaps the processing power has just met its threshold or maybe  game developers are just capped out but looking at some of the racing and sports titles both good examples of graphicperformance last years xbox  and the ps seem neck and neck
this could be because game developers are using the same d models for both systems the same render engine to produce the effects etc
in short its the same story weve always had with the two leading consoles since the genesis and snes
the graphics are in the same ballpark it comes down to the gamesso when comparing the ps with the xbox  comparing both gb hard drive models the question becomes are the ps games worth an extra the xbox  is ahead of the game with their library of titles and online play options and microsoft is doing some really innovative things like making the xbox  the first open console so that hobbyist game programmers can download all the development tools they need and run homebrew games on the system
if youre more the geek type the xbox  is hands down your systemif you compare the ps with the nintendo wii right away youre looking at a very noticeable different in graphics quality between these systems
nintendo opted for innovation unique d controller over performance if you think about it like cars
the ps is like a  ferrari the xbox  is like a  dodge viper and the wii is like a  hummer h
like a hummer the wii doesnt fit the same niche as the ps and xbox its not a high end system its a fun for the family kind of system and thats what makes it the dark horse to win back a large market share for nintendo and that market share will probably be deducted from playstation or xboxregarding blueray
it mostly hype and heres why the high definition media format war is still new
blueray and the other competing standard hddvd just surfaced the motion picture companies are split about down the middle
sony owns the blueray format so naturally they are pushing it
im completely against them forcing blueray on ps customers
this sort of cross marketing has failed time and time again when applied to video game consoles for history lesson see phillips cdi and also the panasonic d both horrible failures world wide
sony should know something about media format failure from their betamax video tape technology when we moved from video tape to dvd there were a number of compelling reasons to do so compact size of media no rewiding interactive menus bounus features  theater sound greatly improved video quality
notice video quality is only one attribute
the jump from dvd to hddvd and blueray only benefits the consumer in one of these areas video quality and that benefit can only be enjoyed by high definition television owners and it gets better that benefit is also difficult to even detect on many high definition sets
you can see the difference on p capable sets but not much else and the question is is that incentive enough to start replacing your entire movie catalog
based on economic principle the answer is nolike others this review is not about amazon resellers or third party vendors
also i am giving my review under the context that at the time i am typing this its jan  so please keep that in mind and read aheadi am a huge ps fan
while the console is not perfect the system has plenty of games almost for anyone regardless of the age
the only thing that still was driving me crazy is that once i moved to ps i stopped using my ps games and just because the new consoles are not compatible with older onesknowing that the gb old units can play both type of games ps plus ps i took the chance
however the unit worked for about  hrs and after that it refused to play  ps games again caput dead
it worked for some of the ps games i have but sporadically which made me believe it was a console issue not because my games
the console was taking the disc without any issue though you can even heard the spinning disc inside but the system was not playing the discs information at all nothingso  i wanted to give the unit a chance    and because i received it during a weekend i had the whole sunday and part of saturday to troubleshoot the problem and see if it was a software issue not hardware unlikely but really wanted to trythat weekend the wife got little or not attention from my side  i performed a full system format quick reset of the console settings tried bunch of games and even manually clean the discs myself hoping it was some scratched disc   i did everything possible that was not hardware invasive you name it  and nothing worked
i literally spent my whole weekend on the issue but the unit never played a single ps game ever again
actually after a few hours it also stopped playing ps games as well which the console was reading hours before sporadically but it wasafter google this a bit more the monday after i found that this is a typical problem on most of these older units
the ps games are blue ray discs the laser and circuit that is in charge of reading that is prone to problems so if that part or parts stopped working you ended with a unit that will only read and play older ps games which are not blue ray discs of course
it can be fixed replacing that part in the motherboard but i do not have the time for that
and to be honest i would not recommend anyone to spend extra bucks and time fixing a unit that in computer terms is ancient and already obsoletelong story short i returned it to amazon
thanks god the seller was amazon prime endorsed and while it took few days i finally received my money backi guess that i will have to display and connect my old ps box to the same tv that i used for my ps console different port of course
or resign myself and send all those ps games to play station heaven aka trash can where they will rest in peace for everoh well thats technology
new gadgets and advances sometimes put good stuff behind even when is still good
 bottom line if you have the money and time and you are willing to take the risk get one of this units and see what happens
but there is no warranty whatsoever that what happened to me will happen to you in one or two months
hate to write bad reviews but i feel obligated to help others and share my experience during the process especially when sony already informed that a new console will be released in spring of this current year making this gb even older and more obsolete than everin my opinion this system was not needed and was only produced because of the xbox and ps emerging
the gamecube never got on its feet and then the wii comes out
it feels like a gimmick that falls flat with the wiimotes and many peripheralshowever i admit that some games are fun and done well and it does continue the nintendo traditionnot long from now another version of the wii will be released that is backwards compatible so dont bother buying this one at all anymoreallegedly by ems is supposed to be dropping the price on the  gb pro model down to which is good for me and microsoftnot so go for nintendo because i had been planning on getting a wii soon and it looks like i wontbigger game librarygb hard drivehigh definition gamingno throwing the controller into the lcd tv and breaking it on accident because of a cheap strapoh and the avatar system that ms hasand the ability to install games to the hard driveso ms is using the same idea as nintendo and sonyhowever they are doing it better because their online network im sure you have heard of itits called xbox livegranted you pay  a year and im willing to do that because of the content availabledownloaded tv episodes in hdrented movies in hddownloaded full gamesgame addonsthe  also when connected to your networkcan stream content from your pc i have a computer running windows xp and vista x on a separate hard drive and have never had any trouble streaming media through my home networki would have handed my money over to nintedobut when my laptop is more powerful than their flagship game consolei start to wonder is it worth it
one reason why the nintendo wii is in demandthey only make what
 units per yearwhereas microsoft and sony make that many consoles in a couple of monthsahhh the wiiwhen it was before its time i drooled like a fanboy at the notion watching the previews and imagining the possibilitieswhen it came out i loved me some wiisports and fell in love with the mii channel
i even made a web site about the wiinow here i am a year later and ive barely touched it
sure mario galaxy is fun and to some degree wiisports hasnt lost its charm and metroid oh wonderful and beautiful metroid but alas this system is collecting dust
it simply doesnt have any of the games the xbox  has been graced with and it doesnt quite handle blu ray movies as well as my pssmash bros may get some juice into its circuit boards for a few weeks and mario kart is coming in early   i mean april  i mean early   i mean and that will surely rockbut is it enoughthe wii seems to present a limitless landscape of possibilities for games but unfortunately nintendo doesnt know what the internet is and thirdparties dont want to waste time with motion controls or big budget gamesthe result
its like handicap children in a playground
its not fair
its not fun
it almost makes you feel kind of sadverdict
the wii has nothing going for it
let the next snaggletoothed hypetrainriding cocacola drinking sellout buy it instead
its a better fashion accessory than it is a gaming consolemy daughter loved the wii when she first got it for christmas and on september or october she said the wii is boring
she plays call of duty world at war on my brothers ps because she likes playing nazi zombies and she neverstops playing it because she likes it
so she should get a ps or an xbox  she hates the wii now
the good thingabout the wii is it has mario games and she likes mario games
the bad things about the wii is poor game choices for her to choose no nazi zombies on call of duty world at war on the wii version and not too much mature games
my daughter likes hardcore games
all of her wii games are to easy for her
buy the ps or xbox the wii could be and should be great
but its not
im a dad with a  year old son
the best game weve played is wii sports which comes with the console
thats pretty sad
the controllers should lead to some creative games but most of the games have been pretty awful
mario olympics is pretty good
lego batman was pretty good and used the controls well
tiger woods golf is pretty much unplayable due to bad controls
many other games are really poorly done like all of the carnival games minigolf etc
wii sports is fun for get togethers and creating wii characters is pretty fun
other than that just about any other gaming system is  better
im sticking with pc gaming myselfok the wii was kicking butt until microsoft came out with kinect for the xbox which is the same only no remote its all body controlled so it forces you to exercise unlike the wii where you can sit on the couch and just be worken the biceps
in other words dont waste money on this product the xbox for one hundred bucks more gives you more stuff and internal game storagethere are a couple fun games like mario cart and the pack in sports game
outside of that this is just a soccer moms bow flex that plays gamecube games
most of what i played before i sold the wii was gamecube games and mario kart
outside of that the wii is worse then the virtual boy
the virtual boy had a good couple of games that still play through emulation
nothing on this console is worth revisiting
it also feeds into the idea that tells moms that violent games turn people into a murder as well as a fat jobless hog
even when i modded my wii it was boring
worst console nintendo ever made except the wii u so far which is just a last gen shovelware console that plays crappy wii games
ds is great though
nintendo sucks now with the exception of the dswe got a wii today for christmas
we have in our household now  xbox s one xbox a gamecube and a wii
we had another gamecube before and a nintendo  before that
so im not an xbox fanboy or whateverim actually glad nintendo is doing welli just think the wii is this years cabbage patch kid or tickle me elmo
everybody wants once simply because everybody wants oneim also mystified at the ratings the wii and its games are getting
i picked up metroid and mario galaxy and thought those would be sure things in a sea of awful games currently available for the wii
boy was i wrongno camera control for mario
are you kidding me
this was a major step forward in platforming and gaming in general all the way back to mario   its a limitation of the wii hardware i suppose so i think it fits here in a general review of the wiihow is pointing the wiimote in metroid better than an analog stick
at least you have camera control with the pointer but is it really any better than using a second thumb stick
i dont think sographics
we all know about the graphical shortcomings of the wii
both metroid and mario are hailed as offering some of the best graphics available on the wii
well thats not saying much compared to even the worst games on the xbox   this is definitely last gen hardware graphically speaking
thats too bad because the gamecube could hold its own against the original xbox and pswii sports  yeah yeah yeah my mom played this with my son this morning which would have never happened on the   i guess this should make me shed a tear for intergenerational gaming
i found the games to be utterly random and unpredictable
my kid flailing wildly threw more strikes than anyone
huhyou need to be squarely in front of the tv to play it appropriately
its a considerationif youre used to gaming on the ps or xbox  i think you will be disappointed in most aspects of the wii
the ace in the hole for the wii is the motion control and imo it isnt implemented all that wellwe had lots of fun with the gamecube and n
and in fairness my kid has been playing the wii all day and i do think the wii zapper is pretty slick and this is a kid who plays a lot of   so it may appeal to somealso it appears to be a high quality machine easy to set up and well packaged
we have  s and theyve been fine but you can definitely tell the wii is one polished piece of equipment
thats always been true of nintendo equipment and this is no differentand bully for the average person who enjoys a wii because theyre intimidated by the controls and games of the pc xbox  and ps
some folks will enjoy the wiis simplebut imo shallowpleasuresi played it today and may continue to do so for quality time with the kids
but for quality gaming and the best titles ill stick with my the nintendo wii is what it isthere isnt much i can say that people dont know
i was just very dissapointed with the console
some of the games are fun but in all honestly most of the games that you use the motion controlls for would be more fun to play with a traditional controller
the other issue i have is with the graphics
we know they arent high definitionbut it seems some of the games the graphics are even worse than on the original xbox back  years ago
graphics arent everything but when you are paying  for a console and  for a game i expected soemthing a little better to look at than what the wii delivers
if you have an old fashioned nonhd tv you can get by with the wii
however if you have a big screen highdefinition television the games might actually look bad and you would be much better off with an xbox  or ps we have all  consoles my personal favorite is the xbox  because it is high def and there are a good choice of games for the kids on there as well as older games for about when the wii was first announced i was a little scared that nintendo was treading in uncharted waters
i had always been a hardcore nintendo fan so i wanted them to succeed thats why i got it the day it was releasedthe wii has great potential because i believe it is beginning the path that videogames need to take
videogames have the potential of easily transitioning into more personal experiences like in minority report
i gave nintendo the benefit of the doubt but as time passed i realized they were not attempting to make a splash only a rippleafter a year regret set in
if i could some how keep my virtual console games for perhaps the wii or  i would sell this thing in a heartbeat
i periodically turn it on bimonthly and the only thing that mildly interests me is the vote channel
at least it collects dust efficientlyim one of those people who camped out at target with my wife on release day of the wii
oddly enough camping out at target with my wife ended up being the most fun thing about the wii
sure i had a love affair with the wii for a month or two
i loved wii sports but that was when i thought the horrid graphics in wii sports were due to the fact that it was a tech demo so i dealt with itthe graphics are terrible across the board on the wii
when you put them up against the ps it just makes it feel like youre playing a game system thats  years old already
the graphics honestly look no better than the gamecube or ps both last generation systemsfinally the worst part about the wii is the control scheme
yeah wii sports was fun for a couple months but once you figure out the wiimote you realize its really not very sensitive and you can manipulate it so that you can bowl a perfect strike every time in bowling or hit homeruns in baseball almost every time and then the boxing game is just plain broken the controls are so bad
when you see all of the ps ports getting thrown on wii instead of the games going to ps and  you really start to wonder about the wii
then when you play those ports with tacked on motion controls the gimmick of it all really starts to hit home
i found waggling the controller from side to side in zelda to be just plain dumb and annoying
oh and did i mention the pointer functionality with the sensor bar just plain sucks
it works for absolute garbageto sum it up i wish i never bought this thing
i play my ps every day and this thing hasnt been turned on in three months now
btw the ps motion controls seem to actually be more accurate to me and the shape of the ps controller lends itself well to flying and driving games which is really the only good use of motion control ive seen yet
the wiimote does not lend itself to flying and driving games because of its shape
it feel very awkward driving or flying with the wiimote tilted on its sidemy advice pony up and buy a ps its a much better value and most importantly the games are a lot betterok first off  im an old school gamer and i know people that work in the industry  i started gaming with the atari  and ive been having a blast since theni still play with my nes snes gamecube n sega systems playstations xboxes colecovision turbo grafx  neo geo amoung otherseven imports so i know what im talking about herei like nintendoits a great gaming company and they have always had awesome systems and rd party games that really shinedwhen i think of playing nintendo  its mostly on the nes or snes classics never go out of stylein fact some of them are more fun to play even today
i know im not alone on this onewhen the wii came out  like everybody i was looking forward to see what was nintendos next gen system like but when i saw the gameplay using that weird controller it was a real letdownnow im not hating or anything here but motion usage in video games dont really workremember the power pad the power glove etc
even some on some wii games  this tech dosent really work  yep this is one system that will sit in your closet collecting dustthats where mine is  and will be for a long time i beti gave the wii a chance and well  it didnt feel like nintendo
first off the system was rushed to  be released to compete with the xbox  and the playstation both systems which  are far more superior in hardware and processing which gives stellar graphics
the wiis graphics are lackluster at bestthink of a dressed up gamecubenothing really eye poping when you think of next gen systemslets talk about gamesyou want to play a campaign with master chief or call of duty modern warfare
well you find these games on the wiibut youll find almost every nintendo  child friendly remake super mario wii
give me a breakhow about making a new character or something
mario was cool  but is played out you look at the wii section   percent of the games are aimed at small childrenminus some of the cross platform games for games on the wii  they are mostly dumbed down to compensate for that weird controller again  and the short attention spans of the player  the wii is a system thats  a party system to be dragged out when  people come overits not a real gaming systemi know the fanboys will likely rip into this  but hey  have you looked at yourselveswaving a controller around  playing games like animal crossing
giggles herethe online system for the wii is a joke  it cant compare to  xbox live or the ps network  the whole virtual console is a good idea but for gamers like me that have our original games and systems stillthis is not making the wii stand outwhen i tried the online system for nintendoit was so lackluster and blandyou can tell this system was  developed with the soccer moms and familys in mindthats why its so cheapthat gimmick worked for them in the beginning but now all systems have price cutsif you want an awesome systemget a ps or a   heck even a gamecube  that still is  a great system
see nintendo used to make great systemswhere i work if i get somebody looking for a great system  i tell them about all   and most  skip on the wiihopefully the next system from nintendo will be worthy of their nameand the wii left in the dustthe ps was ok how can this one even begin to compare
but how else are we going to play all of those unfortunate zelda gameslet me start this off by saying ive always been a fan of nintendo
i grew up playing the original nes loved the snes had over  games for nand then nintendo started to be a let down with the gamecube
yes the gamecube had some quality titles but were the handful enough to justify owning the system
not for me
when the wii came out i was very skeptical and had a feeling id end of passing it up
well after some more consideration i thought it might be something fun for me and my wife to play before i sound too old here note im in my s
after weeks of searching hard to track down the wii i finally managed to buy onethe system started out fun i enjoyed playing mario galaxy smash bros etc
basically the system had those typical quality first part nintendo titles
flash forward and mario kart was released and was definitely interesting to play though personally i preferred the control precision offered with an analog stick and not the wheel
after about  months more of the system sitting around collecting dust i kept searching and searching for quality wii gamesthey were no where to be found
yes the system has some great titles but once again just a small handful like the gamecube did
it seems  of whats released on the system are poorly thrown together mini games that score  ratings and just flat out suck
i cant tell you how many times i stopped to look at the wii games in electronics only to be disappointed time after time with whats available
overall nintendo is still lacking quality third party titlesgraphics completely aside all this time while the wii was sitting i was getting tons of use out of the ps with many great titles
to me the wii isnt quite the bargain everyone makes it out to be
just because the initial system purchase seems small does not mean the overall cost of ownership is
i spent just as much money on the wii as i did my ps once you factor in grabbing a couple controllers  other shells needed for games
that is the whole point of the system rightto play with other people and have fun
nintendo makes a killing on remotes for this thing
sure for the system with the price drop plus  for another wiimote   dollars for another nunchuckoh but wait now theres wii motion plus ok another  dollars for each controller you own
these costs add up very fastnintendo also seems to enjoy crippling their own services
so they offer all those games via the wii shopping channel the games that you can only put on a mb internal storage or gb sd cardare you kidding
in the day in age where you can get gb flash drives for  gb microsd cards the size of your pinky for i think nintendo could of offered a better means of giving us storage for the games
personally to me the wii is not worth the  it was launched for and still isnt worth the  its now selling for
when you look at what the console is capable of doing in comparison to its competition its nowhere even close and i dont mean just graphically
both the  and the ps offer tremendously more features
yes the wii has the motion sensing controller but it seems very few developers make good use of it and even the games that do make interesting use of ityou still lose precision more often than not over a standard and much more comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions controllerit also really annoys me that other than the games running at a max of p resolution nintendo offers no means of improving what old titles look like
both the  and ps offer smoothing effects and also use anti aliasing to clean up the older titles and make them a lot clearer  more vivid
it amazes me that even the most poorly written emulators on the pc sorry not illegal when i own the old systems  games offer screen smoothing anti aliasing etc to make the games look so much better yet nintendo doesnt do thisi realize hardware isnt everything but it is nice to feel immersed in a game with gorgeous graphics and detailed sound
yes the wii is selling good it seems quite popular among families thats great
for myself i sold it and recently bought the holiday bundle xbox  elite
its already got more playtime than my wii had in a year of owning itsorry nintendo but this was my last let down system from youi was lucky enough to get a wii at launch
id read the previews and was very excited to try out the new controller
i thought its potential was unlimited and i didnt care that it lacked highdef graphics
boy was i wrongwii sports was fun at first particularly bowling and tennis
even my wife played and she never plays video games
friends came over and worked up a sweat
i finished red steel and i actually liked it a bit better than call of duty  on the xbox   all was good
then i played zelda which was one of the most overhyped games ever
i found it to be a boring kiddie game
then i tried super swing golf
another disappointment
next was excite truck and while a decent and fun game at first it too got boring real fasti checked gamespot for upcoming games and there are no decent ones on the horizon
im not a mario fan and ill get any cross platform games on the  because graphics do matter
i know a lot of casual gamers say its about the gameplay but the graphics are a big part of that
who wants to look at the wiis blurry p if you have the component cable on their  hdtv
plus the wiis controller has so far been clunky at best which ruins gameplayi guess i should have learned my lesson after owning the gamecube
nintendo does not make the kind of games i like anymore
im really torn by this since i loved my super nintendo and resident evil  on the gamecube was the best game of the last generation unfortunately that was the only game i played on the cube
but i like shooters and the xbox  has plenty of good ones
also its controller feels perfect for them
how are you going to use a scope with the wii controlleri know the wii is selling well at the moment
but i think that is largely due to its low price and new controller that have attracted a lot of casual gamers with short attention spans
they will not buy a lot of games quite frankly wii sports is enough for most and will go on to the next fad
it looks like nintendo has left the serious gamers to sony and microsoft in favor of the childrens market
but at each how many games are parents going to buy for their kids
ultimately i think the software attach rates to the wii will be alarmingly low
this is not the disaster it would be for sony and microsoft since unlike them nintendo sells their console at a profit
but its does not bode well for game selection and the overall health of the wii which may end up continuing the downward trend of the gamecube
nintendos disdain for graphics is  perfect for portable games and perhaps they should focus on their successful ds liteany adult who is considering getting the wii should reconsider what kind of games you want to play
for me the wii was a complete disappointment while the xbox  has been a great platform
i couldnt get my wii on ebay fast enoughthe nintendo wii has been stated by many to have revolutionized gaming as we know it
a drastically deep claim to make in such a powerful entertainment medium that revolves around technology
a claim that i believed as well
the idea of playing games with motions is intriguing enticing and exciting something that many use as a decision maker when it comes time to purchase a console
i was one of the many people who waited in line all night november   for the nintendo wiiafter taking it home that first morning i was dying from anticipation of playing the newest console made by nintendo
i opened the console i liked what i saw
the wii menu is unique and is a great way to navigate the console
the menu displays the contents of the wiis internal harddrive displaying items such as downloaded games and new channels that may have been purchased
navigating the menu requires the usage of the sensor bar and pointing the wii remote at the screen to choose the desired channelthe games feel unique at first requiring motions to control on screen avatars within the games
however as time goes by the feeling of revolution is replaced with tedium
after a few hours of gameplay it becomes obvious that button presses of the past have simply been replaced with simple gestures that do not represent the actual on screen action
for example in past games in order to attack you may have been required to press a but the wii replaces this with a simple shake of the controller
it doesnt even matter as to which direction the controller is shaken in either seeing as the gesture will not match the onscreen motions
the majority of the games on the wii really only use five different gestures simply recycled over and over again
these gestures include shake controller left shake controller right shake controller up shake controller down and thrust controller forward
these gestures do not actually allow the gamer to feel immersed in the game since these gestures are no different than button pressing
the added drawback of these motions is the inaccuracy of the detection of them as wellwhere i started to lose faith in the wii was after picking up some hardcore games for the console
i began by purchasing resident evil  okami madworld no more heroes mortal kombat armageddon dragonball z tenkaichi  and  twilight princess and more
i started to realize that with these games precision is an absolute must
however the wii remotes motion controller actually takes away from the precision due to the poor detection skills of the controller
this results in lag delayed moves incorrect moves and more
in several of these games i found myself repeating missions and levels simply due to the fact that the wiimote would make my on screen character perform the wrong moves
for example  in twilight princess the shield bash is done by pushing the nunchuk forward however sometimes this registered as the nunchuk being moved to the side which corresponds with a spin attack
similar scenarios began to play out with all of the wii games i purchased
every game began to get more frustrating and i began to play my playstation  more and more
finally i came to a conclusion traditional controls just work better for playing games periodthe graphics of the wii are fine in my opinion despite the lack of hd
graphics alone do not make a game fun and that is why i continue to play psone and nintendo  games to this day
however the unresponsive controller gestures of the wii are enough to turn me away from the console
im still hoping that microsoft and sony dont try to follow nintendo too much with motion control gameplay seeing as it actually makes games more difficult and frustrating to play
if youre a gamer looking for a console with great games is a lot of fun and can be played for hours on end with full precision and control dont go with the wii
you cant go wrong with either a ps or a  though both offer a wide variety of games in every genre and both respond the way you tell them to
the wii may have enough perks to attract you if you stick to games such as super smash bros brawl guilty gear and other games that allow the option of playing with either a classic remote or a gamecube controller but not enough games give players this option
also if youre not looking for games that contain in depth controls than perhaps you will do just fine with the wii
the wii has its ups and its downs but for me personally it has been a disappointmentyes when you pick up the wiimote for the first time and play wii sports you are going to think its pretty nifty
but it wont take long until you get tired of all those minigames and shaking the controller around in zelda until you just want to use a normal control pad again
then you are going to start to realize that the wii is very limited graphics wise and most games barely look better then gamecube games at launch
sure you are going to have some fun for a little whileuntil you go over to your friends house and see gears of war on the  in hd for the first time
then its going to sink inwhy oh why did you give into the hype of the wiimote
does shaking that thing around really make games like dragon ball z and marvel ultimate alliance any better
if you read reviews the answer to that is no
so keep a clear headand dont give into the hype
nintendo is reselling you a gamecube in a new boxdont be a fool
save up some cash and get a real next gen console
either the xbox  or ps will dookay so i use to be a nintendo fan boy and then i got a wii
the wii is literally a glorified game cube
it has game cube graphics and processors no hd and no proper controller for most games
this thing is a piece of junk
and there are next to no games to play for it
seriously once you have beat brawl you are out of games to play
save your money and buy a real game console
why would nintendo betray us like thisthis game looks great but it isnt
the graphics are awesome
unfortunately that is all that is awesome in this game
controls for jack and especially for kong are awful
the game is extremely linear
you must follow in the direction of the game
forget about exploring skull islandsave yourself forty dollars or try serious sam  way more bang for your buckghost recon advanced warfighter for pc is a very different game than the  version
its first person for one thing as opposed to third person
the pc version also had a different developer than the  version
the pc version of graw has great graphics frantic gunplay and excellent audio
the biggest difference is the pc version is psychotically difficult
now when i say that im talking about playing it on normal difficulty with no cheat hacks
i am no amateur to the fps genre ive been playing it since the original wolfenstein d back in   ive beaten classic hard fps games such as rogue spear and operation flashpoint
but man graw for pc is on a whole new level of hard
unfortunately its not a realistic hard
the enemies are psychic and can take unhuman damage
more than once i shot a rebel in the head only to have him stand right back up and headshot me immediately as well except id die instantly unlike him
you can hide behind a wrecked car in the bushes at night and youll get headshotted by a rebel far off in the distance despite the fact he has no nightvision or even a scope
and worst of all unlike every other pc fps out there you can not save whenever you want
no youre stuck with sporadic checkpoint saves every  minutes if youre lucky
its not unusual to lose twenty or even forty minutes of progress with constantly regularity
so certain missions parts you will be replaying dozens and dozens of times to get through alive
that is if you play graw pc unmodded and not on easy
so why in the world would someone suffer through a game like this
spite
pure unadulterated spite
some gamers wont let a game beat them down and im one of them
even when said game is an unbalanced nightmare with a crap plot
and lets not even talk about how bad the ai of your squadmates is
i nearly hated this game but i loved standing over its corpse after i finally finished ittom clancys shooter again disappointed everyone who was fascinated by the old game they created which offered people lots of great time such as ghost reconbackward warfighter again owned new technique new toys and new graphic which is just pretty but the content is absolutely not suit the title of the game
your teammate are so dumb that they cant follow your simple command and they cant even follow your pace
this is very annoyed and shows again how sloppy this game is
ubi still dont want to solve their biggest problemaithe reason why i gave this game two star instead of one is mainly because i dont want to be too harsh to a game series that i used to lovenot too thrilled with this game
its just not my type of game is all
there are some who may like it im not one of themi wanted this game to be good but it just didnt do it for me
the godfather is a great move franchise minus  but id pass on the game if i could do it over againgame play less than ergonomic and not nearly as good as some others somewhat like it
for instancemafia ii is a lot better gamehas ea gotten too big
is it true theyre buying up rights all over the place and then very carefully laying those rights in the toilet and then clintoning all over themi believe so
see batman begins and anything with  on the casethe stadiums look good yes
sometimes the players look cool
but the camera is awfulso bad that when youre lining up it goes into an extreme closeup of your quarterback and then falls to his chestas if it were hoping to find breasts therethe gameplay is terrible sluggish ridiculous
the players still look like musclebound midgets
no offense to midgets you know butid like it to look somewhat even remotely close to being as cool as nfl kthe announcing is absolutely horrible and id just gotten to the point where i wanted to kill madden
after hearing this s i miss the hell outta the turducken eating fat bastardthe good
the kicking system is sweet
the crowd and sideline animations are nice for a changeoh yeahno createaplayer
isnt that why we all went apes over football in the first place
yeahea is the worst game company in the industryand also the bestselling
what a friggin dichotomy
i guess until their contract with the nfl runs out ill be football hungryoh and how about that madden curse taking hold of mcnabb this season
hehehegod i hate this gamethere is something wrong when i buy an xbox  and i have to go play my old madden  on the old xbox to get a quality game
other than the graphics this game sucks majorly a huge step backwards
the players move slower you cant change individual defensive assignments no challenges the offensive line movement doesnt even seem like the lines moves at all you have to relearn what every button does on the controller why would they change what almost every button does
the controller isnt that much different performing hot routs is harder offensive juking doesnt even look like the player jukes at all no fantasy draft no superstar mode no create a player dang i could go on and on
ea sports games are the reason why i bought the xbox  i bought two titles so far this one and nba live  they both sucked
what a waste of time
all i know is that ea better do better than this regardless if they are the only ones with the nfl rights to make games
id rather play a generic back yard football game and edit the names in
ridiculous ridiculous ridiculousea sports took a huge step backwards with this game took out most everything that was fun in  you think im joking and all they did was update the graphics
even the gameplay took a step back
i have owned every madden game since it was on the super nintindo and this has got to be one of the most defective in the seriesif you are looking for a football game madden  is ok they fixed a lot that was broken with this one but it would be smart to wait for madden because of the nextgen engine that they were working on for this one and  they are still ironing out a lot of the kinks however having played madden  i feel that madden  will finally be worth our money so steer clear of this one and wait a couple monthsmadden  was the first game i purchased for the   however after playing it and comparing it to the other madden s it fell short and dissapointing
perhaps the only good pointer in my opinion is the graphics those are pretty good but everything else just doesnt live up to gamesome dissapointments i had were that they took the challenge plays mode out
boy do you want to challenge a play when a defensive lineman hits you when are throwing the ballso instead of a forward pass incomplete you get a fumble and they run it back for a touchdownvery frustrating
besides that ea took a lot of other features of game playing outjohn madden himself is not even the announcer now unless you call his plays when play callingthere are many more they left out of the game but one of my other biggie was there is no vibration feedback at all
ea even stated that they didnt have vibration feedback for this particular gametalk about nextgen huh
overall again the only pointer is for the graphics if you want a good football game worth the price wait until madden  and see if that improves otherwise dont be expecting much from madden  for the  this yearmadden nfl has been around for quite a while and has built up an incredible reputation
the xbox  launch release has great graphics  but a few flawslets start with the great parts
we have a high definition tv and the graphics were just gorgeous
you can see the details of the face the definition of the muscles the details of the uniforms
the stadiums have signs in them promoting the home teamthat being said we noticed some issues with graphics right away
some of the camera angles are just awful and made it really hard to connect a player with a ball
the fans in the stand look like robots
also with the incredible detail they put into the character models some simply arent rightim happy to deal with even mediocre graphics if the gameplay is stellar
after all its the gameplay that keeps you going for months and months
we ran into problems here too though
the xbox  console crashed only halfway through our first game  and that was only the beginningyou cant challenge plays either even though some seem mighty suspectthere might be some players who really like the changes and who can deal with the crashes and bugs
if you think that might be you then certainly rent it for a week and see
after a week you should be able to tell how well you enjoy it and if you want to buy it
i definitely feel this is a testbeforeyoubuy titleafter many hours of playing i really enjoyed this game
its a very cool game
lots of fun and really cool graphicsi would highly recommend this game as its really cool
its so much fun to play i went without sleep for  days and spent  nights in the hospital because i stopped eating because there was no time as i was playing this totally cool gamethanks for reading my review
i am if you love golf games this is a must buy
however because ea has exclusive licenses for all of sports you have no choice
i still think links was the best ever for gameplay
overall i like this game but the graphics are not that much better on the  i didnt think the word wow at all
if being tiger while playing you cannot be beat by anyone
they made that way too easy
my buddies and i find that the putting is way too easyi got mine from the big auction website so i only paid  which included shipping
that makes it ok for me
i would never pay  as it is no where near worth 
almost anything ea is not worth this is the first golf game on the  and it shows
unachievable achievements meaning there not unlockable not very funa sports nba live  was unimpressive and felt dated on the current generation consoles
they decided to go for another shot with live  on the xbox  and im disappointed when i say that theres still a lot to desire with this version of the gamewhen you read this youre reading it correctly there are two gameplay modes in nba live  two
theres play now where you play an exhibitionstyle game with an nba team against any other nba team
then theres season where you play through a season with an nba team
after a season youre finished with the game
theres no dynasty mode so you cant even continue after a single season
needless to say this game is so lacking in features that its difficult to care much for it
there arent even freestyle moves that were bragged about in the currentgeneration versions
there is absolutely nothing creative about this game spare the interactive main menuat least the gameplay oncourt isnt bad
the controls are tight on the xbox  version which is a problem i had with the currentgen editions
theres a good balance between threepointers midrange shots and layups andor dunks
there arent any stupid fouls or questionable shots
i only have two gameplayrelated gripes
the first is that the free throw system is far too difficult to get a feel for
in order to shoot a good shot you have to slowly drag the right thumbstick down then slowly move it up
if there is much movement inbetween the updown motion youll almost always brick the shot
the second problem is the camera
im pretty disgusted with the camera actually
its no matter which camera configuration you choose almost every one of them is too far away from the court
i cant count the number of fast breaks i had to slow down in order to let the camera catch up to the action
also there were many times where i was under the basket fighting other players for a rebound only to lose the battle because i couldnt see what was going onthis camera problem goes alongside some of the graphic issues that i have
nba live  is a beautiful game no dobut
the courts look great and the player models are fantastic
there is a ton of detail from player faces to crowd animation
the only problem is that everything nice starts to look ugly when animation frames start dropping and the frame rate drops to a disgusting level
not only that but some of the animations are still very unrealisticive seen players go for layups when they were at least a dozen feet away from the basket
ive seen players run one way magically turn around on a dime and complete a windmill dunk
id have thought that in a basketball game where the visuals were obviously such a large focus that maybe the animation would have been a little smoother and realisticoverall nba live  still isnt on par with other basketball games
the gameplay still needs a few touches there obviously needs to be more to do in the game the glitchy animations and stuttery frame rate both need to be fixed and i hope i never see such bad camera angles again
even with these gripes if you liked nba live on other consoles id recommend that you rent live  for the xbox  to see the beginning of the next generation for this franchise
note i also have this review posted on gamefreakscom where i write reviews on a regular basiswhen eas biggest gimmick is a  second commercial of shaq sweating you know you have problems
without dynasty mode and various other features live stands incomplete leaving the user looking for their receipt
its obvious that lives transformation into the nextgeneration was rushed in hopes of getting the game out in time for the xbox  release
the gameplay is slow there are major camera glitches there are times when the camera completely loses sight of the game  to put it simply the game is just boring
the one bright spot however is its graphics
looking past the sweat the player animations are extraordinary
recognizing your favorite players are not a problem
in all after playing live  you realize it actually offers less than its xbox and ps counterparts
if youre looking for a good basketball game i suggest getting ki can say ea fails yet again in making sports games
madden are all exactly the same
but i got to hand it to ya
taking most of the game modes away does change the game much more then your over all year to year basis
k has been the best basketball developers since the dreamcast sports games
k shines  over this game
this game has great graphics dont get me wrong
but graphics dont make a game
a game is based on gameplay
dont get me wrong but k has amazing graphics also the courts just need a little work
everything else keeps to pace with live
but the gameplay is just plain horrible in live  the players move like clay gumbys and they all shoot the same way
ea has been making sports games for how long and still they damn suck at making them
k i give you credit for making a better basketball game every year then ea it may not sell as well but it is much better
i work at a game store and see more used nba lives then i do cars on the streets
nba live is just teh same as it was  years agowell i was looking for the best nba game to play on my new xbox  and i must say this one doesnt cut it
its gameplay is sluggish and there is too much missingno franchise mode
how can you not have a franchise mode in todays basketball games
its a strong building block for any basketball or football game now reallyno dunk pt or any kind of special mode
this isnt  guys
this is the game just feels roboticthe players the court the fans it all has a robotic feel
i never once was fooled that an nba game would be like this
i was playing as the suns and its amazing how unfluid the game feels i think part of the problem is that it wants to be halfsim and half arcade the action is slowed down but youre still able get a shot basically anytime you want with easethe players appear to skate around alittle bit
the nba had this problem with games back in the nba shootout days
in fact this nba live reminds me more of that rd party series than a game that ea sports should be producingthe camera angles
i actually like to play from the side view but the camera just cant keep up with the action and so you sometimes run out of bounds or get the ball stolen because you cant see were you arei give it   stars overall
the graphics are pretty good andthe broadcasters are good
the problem is the game falls apart once the game starts and with the lack of featuresea said theyre building from the ground up
well why did they charge people  bucks for a freakin demo game basicallygood graphics slick presentation and good integration of past need for speed concepts is hampered by an incredibly frustrating imbalanced police ai that unfortunately you must face off over and over again in the single player mode
the milestone modes will have you pulling your hair out of your head for different reasons throughout the game
sometimes you will find it a struggle to keep the police chase going when you need it having to slow down over and over so they can either find you or keep up other times they will relentlessly pursue you to no end becoming cheaper and cheaper in the process
all in all a real test of ones patience especially the final chase where at the dreaded wanted level  you must keep driving for an eternity while the game piles endless superstrong superfast cop cars suvs and countless blockades there is no reprieve no hiding out you must keep driving until finally a signal pops up on the map that indicates you must get to that point asap
tedious music that youll quickly tire from
it does look pretty on the xbox  in hidef anyways
controls are ok but no great shakes
my verdict
get burnout revenge insteadi was heavily uninspired to play through this game because of how ugly the city was
i mean where did they model this city after
saskatchuan new mexico
its terrible
in the first two undergrounds the city was koolin carbon which i absolutely lovethe city resembles a lessflashy las vegas and makes for an awesome racing experiencebut this city is justnot attractiveand its just not fun to drive around the city at allits just dull and boring
maybe because its always day time
its not even thatthe city is just uninspiring for a racing game
and what is up with the graphics for the original xbox
those are theee worsttt graphicssss i have ever seeen in my lifeeee
it looks like a nintendo  game l not to mention the driving is just not the same as the other games in the seriesand the races are just not as fun
not to mention the clipping and freezing like some other people have stated
i say stay farr away from this oneit just didnt do it for menot when i can play carbon and be alot more satisfied with that racing experienceor even the original nfsug which is  times better than this even tho you cant freeroam the cityi have yet to actually play nfsug which i ordered off ebay so i should get it soonbut im willing to bet its going to look and play  times better than this
they should have just skipped over this completely and did carbonmost unattractive game in the seriesill this is my first time playing dead or alive
im not a big fan of tekken like games so ill try to be fair as possible
i can appreciate any fighting game that doesnt allow to much button mashing
what frustrates me is how this game is ridiculously too accurate in the fighting scheme the makers of this game has employed
i can read the manual so many times and even the online guides but i barely get rewarded in trying execute self defense moves especially the simple blocking
i dont know if its the game or my joints on my fingers arent loose enough but i swear that i barely get to do a counter hold on any combono matter how hard i time it well
what frustrates me more is the blocking mechanismit barely works and when it does it usually get overrided with a ridiculous blow or kick that launches you up and down to the ground
and when do try to get up its hard to evade a cheesy low attackyou just have to absorb more until your lucky enough to reply with a little combo of your ownill stop the ranting
would i recommend this to newcomeres of dead or alive
no
most likely youll be more frustrated than having fun
i cant speak for the rest that have played this series for a whilelook this is not really a good game i orderd it and played it once and was done with it maybe cuz im not a die hard mortal kombat fan so maybe just one for the fansthis game is a crappy crossover to the psp
if you want this game buy deception on the ps
its graphics are not choppy and the controls are responsive unlike the psp versioni was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detectivelike game
unfortunately this game is very kidlike
heres an example
the first non autogenerated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy
these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a childrens word game book
i easily got all of them except  meaning i couldnt progress past this point
no problem for me because by this time i didnt want to
im not saying its a bad game its just probably not a good game for grownupsfirst let me start off by saying i am a huge fan of the nancy drew game series
now for the disappointing news  secret of the old clock just isnt up to par
those of you that have already played will know exactly what i mean by that
after months of waiting and the fact that this is nancy drews th anniversary i really did expect a better game to come from the programmers
come on guys you know you could have done betterher interactive has tried to freshen things up a bit by having sotoc take place during the depression era but unfortunately they forgot to do the same with the puzzles and the interface
with the exception of the minigolf course in this gamea good idea in theory all we get in this installment is more of the same old noninteresting puzzles that all of us adventure gamers have seen a thousand times before
and while we are on the subject of the mini golf game i think the programmersneed to do a lot of retooling of the putting element as there isnt even enough room to make a decent attempt
and dont even get me started on the roadster and the endless driving about town nonsensewhere are the interesting characters storylines intrigue plots and intuitive puzzles
i suggest that her interactive and atari think about making a much longer game for those loyal fans out there that love the nancy drew concept
how about a  hour game next time  huh
maybe then well get at least a few more hours of play
please stay away from just rushing to get the nextgame to market i prefer quality in my purchases
better luck next time  i hopei had been looking for some new nancy drew games to play and decided to get this one
unfortunately it wasnt that good and my advice is to skip it unless you are a diehard nancy drew fan
the story wasnt very intriguing the setting was mediocre and the game simply wasnt well donethe game takes place in the s as opposed to modern times when the games generally take place
most of the action takes place in and on the grounds around an inn a neighbors house and the surrounding area
nancy has a car which she spends a great deal of time driving around in
this is not firstperson driving eitherthe car drives along a maplike network of roads while nancy must avoid potholes
driving of course costs gas and nancy must earn money by delivering telegrams
for players who hate these kinds of tasks this game is a very poor choiceas for the characters they dont do much to help the game
the neighbor is a pompous twit emily is a sad girl who stays in her room her guardian doesnt play a large part through most of the game and the banker is the happyhardy type
you hear other characters voices in the game such as when you make deliveries but you never actually see themi dont know if ill ever play this game again
if you do buy it make you sure buy an inexpensive copy
as a side note some of the screenshots shown in the screenshot gallery on the top of the page on amazon are actually from another game curse of blackmoor manor
if you do decide to get secret of the old clock some of the people and locations shown here will not appear in the gamethank you nintendo for another halfhearted and incomplete interpretation of a pro sports game
your unparalleled brand recognition tricked myself parents and fans pay full price for something that should been free on the internet
there is not enough content to keep this game interesting only one pitching viewpointtop down the batters float into positionooh theres only enough characters to fill the rosters of two teams
what the fudge
on top of all that the actual game play was so laid back it felt like i was playing pool
i predict mario and luigi to be the best all around characters in mario wrestling soon to be released with limited playablitiy at a store near youunrealistic size fields  they are tiny yet very little balls go really deep baserunning is horrible the fact you have to constantly power up your pitch and swing to achieve something good gets old fast bad overall control of the fielderstheres no fun to this gamethe game has fairly good cartoonish graphics for the time it was made
the voice acting is clique but serves its purpose for the game style
plenty of war materials to get anyone happy
the biggest issue is the controls
they are hard to get use to and some what clumsy
it didnt feel natural to move and conduct basic movements and commands
after a while i got tired of it and simply put the game down
i dont any intention of ever playing it again
just not worth the timeboy and i mean the title of my feelings about this game
for one thing do not believe the requiriments given to play this game
the graphics are no better than their earlier game black mirror but you need more to play ithaving said that the promised story line only sort of delivered
yes there were nazi plots for eternal life and all that sort of thing indiana jones like and the part in the nazi mystery mines were different but all in all as far as the extraterrestial mayan etc bit they really were a tag on and didnt deliver as the description of the game would sucker you into buyingcertainly if you are close to a crazed adventure gamer as i am graphics count for a lot and these were ok but as i said before they werent much above black mirrormoving on  the quality of enjoyment was real mixed
all too many times you are required to talk to the same people at least three times to be able to move on
aside from that there was also lot of toing and froing to the same people and that to me was not well integrated into the story line of the game but more just to get through with itthere is one truly killer puzzle in there  just towards the end and unless you are a rubics cube fan im not you like me will resort to a cheat
do it
most folks on the gamer sites have admitted to this
boy it helpsa final word about the graphics acting etc
for some reason the same guys who put out dark mirror are really into rain  big time
no one seems to get wet but its depressing
the acting dialogue etc is pathetic for the most part
the dialog really needs help as to the people who were hired to read it didnt see names on the credits but by then i didnt care
the game promised a lot took a lot in hardware and software mine wasnt all that shabby and delivered  only sort ofas a final note ive read at least  reviews before mine who noted the game playing like they were working under water
if you dont have the right combination of video card and os you will meet the same thing  or worse
i would not recommend buying this game but if you want to im pretty sure the used copies are out there
buy the cheapest you can findthis game definitely has nice graphics
the story is soso just like the prize ending sequence really lacks mystery and intrigue
im not a fan of syberia although loved the graphics either and i liken this game to it
there is no challenge when getting around the game i like to call this hotspotsforidiots
like another reviewer said a nice afternoon of play
why an afternoon
because if you could get the character to run it would take about an hour rather than a few hours
you have to paaainfully watch ol marty walk like a slug to the next hotspot
there are a few puzzles but only one is somewhat challenging
repetition is the basis for the challenge
i did not experience crashing issues running on windows xp with sp which is definitely a plus
since there is such a lack of good adventure games out there you may just get this when it sells for cheap
amazon has changed their policy on who can sell which is bad if you like to recycle games like myself
grrr i gave it an overall  stars but based on stable gameplay and graphics id give it  or a cthe puzzles are so stupid
the story is good that is why it got  stars but its wasted on the dumb puzzles
i couldnt even figure out how to finish this game
this game is exactly like mysterious island and echo in its menu and game play
it takes way too long to figure out which items go with which
and going back and forth back and forth got right on my last nerve
this game is frustrating not entertainingthis is a joke right
the dozens of star reviews have got to be from people in some weird club that gives glowing reviews to boring games for the sole purpose of annoying people
look im not some antinintendo person in fact nintendo is my favorite developer
and im giving this  stars overall because the technology is amazing
but this game is no fun and here are my reasons whyfirst off nothing to do
how can one reviewer say that heshe was playing it nonstop when your options are exhausted within minutes
hasnt nintendo seen the excellent petz series by pf
magic where there are literally hundreds of places toys breeds and outfits
here all you can do is take walks enter contests teach tricks and buy things ill talk about these more latermy second complaint extremely aggravating voice control
look the voice recognition is really cool
the dogs really recognize individual voices
the problem
well after you teach your dog a trick it will only respond after that if you say the command in the exact same way
therefore i found myself saying sit over and over in different ways trying to find the right way
how is this fun
the game should allow for you to vary the way you say the command at least a little bitthird the game takes far too long to open up
lets say i want to buy my dog some cool toys
oh wait not enough money
hmmm how about entering a contest to earn some cash
nope my dogs not welltrained enough
well then ill take it to the gym to train it
oops not enough stamina to get to the gym and back
so what can i do
play with the  toys i have available wrestle with the painful trickteaching system or watch my dog wander around my empty house
what a joynumber four not enough tangible effects
the only things that are tracked on your puppys stat screen are hunger thirst and cleanliness
playing with it does not make it happier there are no stats such as speed strength intelligence or even appearance that you can raise
so basically nothing i did had any impact on the game
whats the point in throwing a tennis ball over and over if your dog seems to forget about it the minute you stop
beats methis game is aggravating boring and a good concept wasted
the dogs are cute and the technology promising which earns this  stars overall but there is no entertainment
the only imaginable use for this is to show little kids who beg for pets how boring it really isoh why didnt i come here and read the reviews first
i would have saved my almost  bucksi quickly bought this game because i had fun with the previous harry potter games mostly    but once i installed this latest one and tried to play itwell it was one big mess
the reviews are true the controls are positively atrocious
here i am banging at my keyboard controls trying to make harry go this way when he goes the other wayand he doesnt stop
he keeps on running until he hits something
i thought it was just my computeruntil i realize that many people are having the same problem
oh by the way there is no mouse support control
everything is simplified so even the option menu is bare minimal autosave and subtitles choice only
after a while it got too frustrating so i chunked the gamei dont recommend this gameat least a full price
dont be fooled like i was
you might have better luck getting the gaming system versionwhoa how did we get here
i mean really  the first harry potter games i got were  ootp and  hbp and then i got this one large step downnnnof course i played them in the wrong order if i played starting from  to  to  to this one  its pretty goodalright im ready lets do this presentation graphics  theyre alright kinda blocky kinda boring nothing special people are kinda plain looking spells are kinda cool thoughpotential  is the th time the charm
well it looked kinda fun while reading the description you sure do have a lot of charms to inflict on your enemies mostly animals
and not much else besides normal spells the description box says you can experience thrills of the movie oh yeah
quidditch world cup scene was soso especially since you were in the woods away from the running and the screaming and the blasting not very fun in the woods around little animals that try to attack you and death eaters you cant attack ehhh not very thrilling especially for a first levelcharacters and voice  well you can play for harry hermione or ron
but there isnt really anything different if you look closely they really all look the same just kidding
but they are pretty blocky and uhhh professor moody
weird eye guy
your voice is very annoying i dont like you yeah voice in this game is just mostly an annoyancecircumstances  at least ea took advantage of a new take on the hp games and made it a bit darker and more battles but do i want to be attacking animals and things all the time
nooo i want to attack the death eaters
  a different game though in this instance is not very good just stick with the hogwarts approach this game altogether wasnt very entertaining you go on sort of milk runs and just go through the motionsoh and back to the description  all the magic of the movie
how about almost none this game felt dumbed down the opposite of what it tried to do and it feels kinda young and repetitive almost annoying which shouldnt be a factor in a gamei bought this knowing full well it would be dissapointing
part of this complete collection right
okey heres the good the bad  the ugly
i reccomend sticking to the st  gamesgood eyecandy colors textures graphics sound backgrounds movement character designs special effects
the console coordination is very easy to learn  the spells are easy to remember
if you suck at games you can get through this game without cheating but if youre that terrible megagames has the only complete trainer
no overly obvious glitches found in the first few games those were just horriblebad if you dont suck at games itll take you a few hours to zoom thought this game stressfree  with little effort
levels are rushed  too short
no cheats  no debug  no exploring
this game will actually miss the old days of crappy polygons because its obvious that all the effort went into said eyecandy  not gameplay or script
the options menu is abismal you cant save only auto save you cant adjust control keys  you cant adjust the gammaugly on a brand new compy with xp this game might crash at the begining or end of every level every single time
eas support page wont open  causes the computer to freeze
eas registration will tell you that youre not registered  when you try to reregister it will tell you that your email  user name are in use
this is probably just an xpea site incomatibility errori have played the harry potter pc game from start to finish several times and it is horriblei have deleted my original review of two stars because the pc version is next to impossible to play for a single playerthe only detailed instructions provided are on how to disable all security programs and background tasks  for better performanceevery time the game is playedthe problem is ea wants us to leave our explorerexe background task on while we play the game meaning we are internet accessible
that is too much to ask of any pc ownerthe game content is repetitive tedious and punishing not to mention mean spirited and sadisticthe trio are repetitively burned stung bitten and shot at with darts over and over and over without a breaka fellow potterhead remarked the artwork is great but im too busy fleeing for my life to even take a look at it
the condencending derogatory personality they assigned to hermione and the dumification of ron increases the level of irritation and makes the game downright annoyingharry is more like my uncle harry than harry potter he doesnt know enough toget out of the waythe computer controlled characters do not work very well
when there are monsterous creatures requiring joint spell casting my computer characters would either drop a rock on me squirt me with plant acid or wander off and try to close a gate i just openedon the section of timed challenges the computer characters either wasted time or got in each others way preventing me from advancing over and over and overwhat is really sad is the constant torture of young teens as a form of entertainmentyou get stung and bit and burned over and over and over in a quest for a shovelyes a shovelfinishing the game gave me a sense of relief not accomplishmentthe few positive user reviews i have come across for pc cdrom goblet of fire have been from users who had just started the game and were no further than a quarter way through from users who had played the game on another platform and gave the same identical review for seven platforms goblet of fire is available on to raise its dismal ratings and one from an accomplished gamer with a state of the art gaming computer who understands the nuances of how pc games are writtendont let the powers that be capitalize from this exploitationmjhi am only at the second level of this game but have to confirm what other reviewers mentioned before getting the characters to go where you want them to go is a challenge and the fact that you cannot change the camera angle makes it even more difficult
you cannot choose what spells to cast and when you cast aiming is a problem because the characters are so hard to controloh well what did i expect this is just another moneymaker in the harry potter franchise not a game designed by people who enjoy the books and try to bring them to lifethe title sums up my feelings for this gamethere is no let up in the hordes of undead coming at you from the moment you step into a new area until all enemies are vanquished at which point an exit is  made available to you to do it all over again on a new level this basically is the entire game
on each level once cleared you can go hunting for ammo shields power ups etc
after two levels of this i was bored bored bored and couldnt even bother to continue with this gameon the positive side the graphics were very good and the atmosphere had a spooky ambiance to it however these attributes were not enough to make me want to keep goinggamers that liked the original old fashioned run and gun fpss will probably like this game
however ive gotten to the point in my fps gaming of wanting a plot or at least some situations that require some thought  challenges that make you consider  your surroundings skills and weaponry etc
instead of just blindly plodding on while continually squeezing the triggerall in all a game that is the new definition of the word tedious it offers nothing more than monotonous endless killing and little else
 starsi didnt like itheres whygraphics  not good at allgenericnothing more i can really say about itgameplay i felt very weird about the whole thingfelt very genericclunkysound best thing about the gamethe best soundtrack out of any game i have ever playedbottom line the soundtrack saves it from getting a just move on from this and be glade they dont make these anymoredidnt like iti wasnt like the old games that i enjoyed playing
hard to access different levels
i played it once and now its just sitting in my roomi went back through the original  games to see which ones were worth still playingthis game isnt all that bad but lacks in quite a few areas
the story tutorial doesnt guide you through the moves very well
you will be facing challenges needed to level up without any guidance on how to complete them
the characters are very hokey and the dialogue is pretty stiff
the animations are worse as when they talk you can see clear down their throatsif you love tony hawk games then this one will probably suit you well
if on the other hand you are a casual gamer and not specifically fan of the genre then dont pick up this game and try one of the  others for the this game was okay i get tired of the samething over and over again
this game was like gta but with some added stuff like going in stores and aressting people but the rest is the same
okay let me tell you the games that are no different gta gta sanadreas gtavice city gtavice city stories gta libirty city stories and forlife
ill give saints row credit cause thats a awsome game with better quality and stuff and customization but back to this game
this game was okay if you really like doing repitive stuff then go ahead
i liked some songs in this game but thats it the rest is just no different
yet again the picture view was terrible like gta is the picture quality is to small you cant even lie down on your bed and play the game you have to sit up and see what your doing thats the big problem
interigation is pretty stupid why bother threatning a clerk if you can easily beat the mess out of him for the money
so that didnt make any sense
the storymode was okay it wasnt that bad but it was the same like gta so this game was okayi rented this game and i thought it was ok the gunplay is the biggest dissapointment
the targeting reticles blow and the gunfights in the game are mediocore
dissapointing sequel even though theres a large city it all looks the same
the things you do as a  cop will get old fast and the driving is ok and the music isnt very good
its a shame because i thought this game had potential
this series still needs lots of workfirst of all i loved this game
im not an avid gamer and this game wasnt too hard for me
i would otherwise have given it four stars if it werent for the number of bugs this game has but more on that latertrue crime new york city follows in the popularity of the gta series but setting it in new york city
you can travel anywhere in the borough of manhattan which is a huge map
i live in nyc and im mostly pleased with the fidelity they have given to the city
there are times when ive been so busy admiring the scenery that ive crashed into peoplethe story of the game follows marcus reed a reformed possibly
gang member who has joined the police force at the behest of his mentor
after his mentor was killed he decides to follow the track of crimes and see who is behind it
this leads him to a series of meetings with some colorful charactersif youre not interested in the story there are other things you can do such as cleaning up the city racing around manhattan participate in fighting arenas etc
you can also be a bad cop and exhort vendors and suchgraphically the game is beautiful
the physics seems a bit weird but you should get the hang of it
you have a cool selection of weapons and cars to choose from
i also liked the way they drew the characters making them look quite realok about the bugs
they suck
ive checked with others who have xbox and gamecube editions and its the same
i have never encountered a game with so many bugs
that requires emphasizing as i hope the folks at activision would hear about this and never put out a game as buggy as this one
the customer support forum is not helpful
they just ask you to reset the console
well duhmost of the problem has to do with the game freezing in the middle of gameplay
you just have to save a lot because if you dont you lose all your progress
its still a pain because you have to begin at the start of the mission but since the missions arent overly long thats not that bad but still annoying
other things have to do with poor gameplay design
for example in one of the street races every time you lose you have to go back to a police booth to get your car because the one you just raced is too battered and there isnt a garage in sight to fix itits a shame that this game had so many bugs because it was truly one of the most addictive games ive ever played
rumor has it that theyre making true crime new york city   a word of advice to activision fix the dang bugstrue crime new yorki actually just rented it tonight played it for  minutes and repeatedly said the phrase this is gay
for everyone that found streets of la to be a pretty decent experience probably will not like this crap
from the getgo it feels solid and very intense possibly worth the time
my mind soon changed when i got into the game
i know its new york and traffic jams are common but come on
you can barely run without smacking against a friggin car
i mean i realize la
had its fair share of bugs to make it not great but this is just lame
i am by no means a grand theft auto fan at all but they completely stole the concept from san andreas and threw a new name onto it
thats all i have to say
depending on your preferences it may be worth a rent but i strongly urge you to not spend your cash on this pilei liked the first true crime a lot so when they announced this game i had high expectations for it
i got it and started to play it and i loved it i was like yeah
another true crime but then after the first  minutes if gameplay it turned into crap
it was kind of like the creators put all there effort into the first five minutes of the game then they were just like alright lets finish this already
the first five minutes of gameplay are nonstop actionu are in a warehouse killing all these gang members for revenge or something with these two sick uzis but then a cutscene happens and all of a sudden alakazamits crap
after the cutscene you are a cop and it is two years or something into the future and you and your partner are set to go on a mission
you drive there and your partner walks in alone and the whole place explodes
your cop expectations go down and now oyu must work your way up doing dirty work
thats basically the whole game doing dirty work and its not fun at allprobably the most fun out of the game is just running around on foot because the driving is horrible and arresting random people and showing them your badge and shooting your gun in the air
everything else sucks
the storyline missions are so boring and pointless
all you do in the story missions are go to this random guy and get told about this bad guy who needs to be in jail but its your job to figure out where he is
so the random guy gives you a list of poeple who might know something about the wanted bad guy
so you go to a warehouse and kill everyone in it and make the person tell you something about the wanted bad guy and then you go to another warehouse and do the same thing about three or four times till you have found enough info on the guy to take him out
then once you have got that guy the random guy gives you another guy you need to find info about
and thats over and over till the story missions are done sounds boringright
well it is
there are side missions but they suck and are also boring
like doing missions for your father or taxi missions and racing missionsthe environment is horrible now i know new york city is awesome and what not but nyc sucks in a game like really sucks
first of all the place is so freakin huge that if oyu want to do a mission you have to drive for like five minutes just to get to the person who tells you the mission
then you have to drive to where the actual mission takes place which is another five minutes
this will keep you from doing the other missions because you will be likeeh i dont want to drive all the way there lets just do this misssion
the car crashing is also horrible
when you crash you most likely do a  degree turn which gets really annoying when you are in a cop chase
also the place is just boring its the same looking buildings over and over again and its like never day and ther is always garbage flying across the screen its like a dumpoverall the whole storyline sucks
basically because there is no specific storyline
the game jst feels like someone regular normal life the normal life of a cop
the sound sucks too especially the cars
when you crash it is the most irritating noise and the cutscene volume is so low while the gameplay volume is super high
so you will turn up the volume while in a cutscene and forget to turn it lower for gameplay and your ears will blow out from the noise
the controls are also bad
since its like just based on a normal life of a cop you are able to do all the normal things making you use all buttons on the controler
i mean the back button  shoot in the air now when is the back button ever used except for menus
the fighting stile is cool but it kind of gets confusing with all the buttons you have to pressyou are able to do all the same things as the first like badge showing and arresting and fighting moves and shooting in the air
really the most fun i have in the game is driving at full speed in a car and when someone does that stupid thing like in all games where they change lanes and get infront of you to make you crash so i slam into them from the back and then make them get out of the car and arrest them because in all other games you cant do anything about it like gtaoverall this game is bad and not what it could have been or should have been
i would not recommend this game to anyone its just so bad
if you true crime fans want to try it be my guest but you will be surely disappointed
all you other people if you want to rent it just for the first five minutes of the game go ahead
this game is m for mature blood and gore intense violence strong language strong sexual content use of drugsapparently the fact that this game bears a striking resemblance to gta in more ways than one has been addressed more than enough so i wont go there directlyi will however comment that while this game is fairly entertaining it lacks the essential nuances that made the first true crime a unique title capable of holding its own next to the gtasin the first tc you had to explore the city in order to find the places to upgrade your character and those upgrades had to be earned through usage of the skills
also the la cityscape had a lot more variation from residential areas to commercial districts and the freeway system was awesomein tcnyc youre bottlefed upgrade locations theyre clearly marked from the getgo so theres really no need to explore the city
plus the upgrades are purchased not earned with money that is very easily acquired
essentially you walk into a dojo pay a few bucks and congrats you know karate instantaneouslythe rpg sense of upgrading and building your character that made the first tc fresh and new is all but gone from this title
itll take you about an hour or two to achieve the maximum cop ranking and that only unlocks a few cars and weapons which can just as easily be purchased from one of the games dozens of vendorsyou can take a cab or the subway anywhere you want to go including active crime scenes and thats just dumb
also seeing as the cab rides are dirt cheap it almost makes no sense to drive anywhere especially when the most realistically rendered thing in the whole game is new yorks infamous bumpertobumper gridlock
also and maybe i was wrong to expect anything different perhaps nyc really looks like this but i honestly got bored with the same drab surroundings block after block after block after you get the point
i started taking cabs everwhere just because the tedium of driving and wrecking at every intersection caused a malignant tumor to form in my brainanother point is the car mechanics
almost every vehicle you drive feels too big and weighty
perhaps it was the close feel of the narrow streets but even the sports coups felt like school buses
ever tried a jacknife turn on a twolane oneway street during rushhour traffic
it sucks both in real life and in this game
and forget about driving backwards even if youve got a car that can haul  going forward our hero marcus reed backs up like my grandmotherthen they added the clothes changes and hairstyles which to me just screamed we wish we were gta
honestly neither has any bearing whatsoever on the game your environment or the people around youall in all that game doesnt make for a bad gta knockoff but it does lack in the sequal department
ever since the first tc ive anticipated this sequal
i waited two years and all i got was this crummy tshirtthis is the worst generic gta ever made
the controls suck and graphics are terrible
this is a waste of money game
ps version is alot better la editionthe gun seems to be one of those games that receives either all high reviews from some people and all bad reviews from the others
and once you play it you understand why
the game itself isnt a mindless shooter like serious sam but feels more like grand theft auto in the midwest when law was something people only read in the books
ahh well who am i kidding
they didnt read books therethe game is set in a relatively free roaming world in the wild west where the job of a main character varies from simply surviving an ecnounter with a crazy drunk with a gun to bringing down one of the most wanted enemies
there are plenty of missions to do of a few types but they all mostly evolve around shooting or runningriding much like gta if you think about itthe idea of the game seems relatively fresh at least setting wise and there are certainly some good points about the game
riding a horse for many missions certainly is a highlight of the game
but there is a reason why in my opinion this game only gets  starsto begin with the graphics in this can at most be considered mediocre and at worst well simply poor
while environments seem pretty interesting and well enough made the character models are some of the worst you will see in the current xbox  games
quite frankly the quality of the character models seems of a good dreamcast game or a poor ps game
which leads to the next point  why pay extra ten dollars for the game that looks and plays pretty much identical to regular xbox and very close to ps versions
some may say its worth it for a hdtv support but in my opinion this is pretty foolish
even i will not give you much joy if the characters up close look like they were rigged by a high school student messing around with d studio maxthe animation is also very poorly done
not only there is a huge lack good looking effects but when a shooting breaks out it seems like the enemies steps and moves dont even match whats going on the screen
if you thought sliding feet against the floor was bad wait until you see these npcs movesbut graphics arent the most important part in the game right
right
but the biggest offender in this game is not poor looking graphics but rather poorly designed controls
from the very start a player is taught the basic controls with small hunting missions which i must admit are very well blended into the storyline
but soon it becomes quite clear that shooting and aiming is rather frustrating than fun
and although gun uses similar idea of bullet time from max payne game for a quick draw slow motion shooting it is poorly executed
left analog stick cycles the targets that are near your view but adjusting the view is nearly impossible manually in that mode beaceuse camera barely moves
which leads you to constantly switching from quick draw to adjust the cameraalthough the storyline is certainly there and it blends quite well into the game overall dealing with some individual missions is just tedious
anytime you are attacked by the npcs you can count on dozens of them coming out wave by wave for a shootout
they die from one or two shots usually and dont possess too much danger if you get used to controls but after a while you just start to wonder when the wave of mindless enemies will be over already
some enemies can pack a punch espcially bosses but at the same time you can heal instantly by drinking out of the bottle right there in combat
silly
yes
majority of my mission failures were caused either by not knowing what to do mostly due to poorly provided objectives or simply by messing up because of horrible aiming and shooting controlsat the end unless you always wanted to play a step down version of grand theft auto but set in the wild west stay clear of this game
you will do yourself a huge favor if you still decide to check it out if you rent the game first
and even if it happens that you like it save yourself some money and buy an xbox or a ps version instead if you have either of those two consolesthe graphics are amazing however the ais are very hard and the game itself is way to hurried and very unfun
not a good gamei dont know how all these satisfied reviewers didnt notice the glaring technical glitches in brothers in arms earned in blood on the xbox
the game has so many problems that ive given up on it and will try and complete the game on pci should start by saying that i loved road to hill  i found it to be a very competent game that ran surprisingly well on the old xbox
but in this sequel gearbox ratcheted up the difficulty and exposed many flaws in the gameplay balance
they also botched the programming for the system resulting in horribly lagging sound and video that corrupts the gameplayspecifically certain enemy weapons like mg nests and the german antitank artillery have been given improved range and accuracy
but the range and intelligence of the players comrades has not improved
this results in a lot more foolish deaths due to ai mistakes than in the first game
and friendly armor is now totally worthless
your tank commander cannot locate enemy gun emplacements before the enemy artillery zeroes in and begins firing
and sometimes your guy will announce that hes commencing firing while just sitting there and taking it
cover doesnt work as well either now that more germans are armed with panzerschreks
combine this with the restrictive pathing that too often doesnt allow flanking and you end up running head first into enemy fire just trying to get lucky and finish the missionon the technical side there are terrible problems with this game that i found insurmountable
even with all the graphic options turned down its unplayable on many of the busier missions
the sound and video lag results in many deaths before you can even see the enemy
and sadly it seems to get worse the further you progress in the story
it hurts my ego to admit but i just couldnt finish the game
dont trust my words read the eib bug forum on ubisofts site
people with all years of xboxes have problems with this gamein conclusion earned in blood may have been great on the right platform pc i hope but on xbox its just a hassleghost recon advanced warfighter is a military squad based shooter that has been released on many platforms
unlike the previous editions ghost recon  and gr summit strike this game for the xbox is played entirely in first person with the gun in view
i always like ghost recon as a first person shooter like the original game and island thunder so this was a plus for me
a lot of people however probably would have loved another gr game with the over the shoulder view like seen in the xbox  version
personally i have not been the biggest fan of the ots view in gr games but in terms of graw i find it to work a lot better than the first person gun view seen in the xbox version
im not sure why they chose to have this view considering the ots view was in ghost recon  and summit strike but this was the first of many other mistakes made in the making of this gameanother very noticeable detail that is far behind compared to the xbox  version is the graphics
i mean obviously they are going to be worse we are comparing an xbox  game to one on the xbox
even so they seem pretty bad for the xbox itself
the game seems like it tries to be as good as the xbox  version but fails miserably
instead of trying to use the xbox to the fullest this game almost feels like a bad port even though the gameplay is way different
i mean there is like a nice haze and lighting effects in the xbox  version of the game and in this version they try to create this so hard but it comes off very strange
there is like this weird orange glow in the xbox version
other than that the textures are off not horrendous but nothing special
the environments seem repetitive and graphically speaking are only as good if not worse than gr
the ai in the game seems very blah
at some points in the game they are very good and almost mimic real like situations
most of the time however they seem to run into the bullets
one thing that is bad but kind of good at the same time is that you only have  other soldier to help you along the way instead of the  you get in the xbox  version
i like this in the sense that its easier to control only one but at the same time it makes for a weaker ghost recon experiencethere is also a multiplayer portion of the game to keep players busy months into the future
there is a wide variety of maps and weapons to choose from while playing over xbox live and makes for an enjoyable experience
you can have  people in a game together at once which is a good number for this type of game
there is also a coop mode for yourself and one other player to play the campaign mission together onlineoverall this game is good and bad at the same time with a higher portion leaning on the bad side
there are things i liked things i didnt like and it was just an ok gaming experience
obviously the xbox  version of the game is better and because of this it makes this game even worse
because of this if you are only looking for a single player experience i would not recommend this game
if you have xbox live and have liked ghost recon online in the past you may want to look into picking this up
if you have the choice between this and the xbox  version howeveryou know which one to buywell anyone who thought that the current gen versian of graw could match up with the  versian is disheartened
graw for the xbox is the worst game ive played this year
unimpressive graphics crap for controls and gameplay and its laggy in single player
i am shocked that this game was made by ubisoft
there simply is no redeeming factors for this game its just simply awful and ubisoft should be ashamed of themselves for screwing over current gen owners with this craptacular game and whats even worse they had the nerve to sell it for  thats just low
easily the worst entry to gr series its one you should avoid
the only gr game that could be worse than this is ps versiani noticed that every ghost recon game is practically a completely new game and although advanced warfighter is based on the same basis as the previous versions this one has has several marked differences
for instance the controls are very different also the way you control your team is different
i liked and enjoy the gameplay very much but that wasnt enough for me to like it overall
actually the game is excellent when playing alone in your xbox but playing on xbox live
is another storythe graphics are good but not as good as they should have been for a trilogy of games that have been on the same console xbox for a very long time
everybody knows that when a new console comes out the games arent that good because the developers dont know the hardwaresoftware very well yet but they improve their versions with time
the original xbox is now an old console and ghost recond  should have been a very big improvement over desert siege island thunder jungle storm summit strike when playing online you and your teammates move like a fixed bitmap
but for me the worst thing that i found with advanced warfighter are the awfully long loading timeslet me tell you how it is how you play a new game with a friend on xbox live
first you select create game then choose the type of game if you want to play cooperatively you have only  options a combat or a mission
forget about respawns they dont exist anymore
say you choose to play a mission wich you have to have finished before by playing the game on solo mode
you select from the opened available missions just one you dont have map rotation or anything else the one you select is the one you will play
then wait for an eternity for the map to load
then the game goes to pause mode and you have to invite your friend to play with you
heshe accept the invitation and have also to wait for another eternity for hisher game to load
ok now you both are in the same screen and you may begin chosing your weapons for this mission and go play but first you have to wait again for another eternity for the game to load for both of you
finally your playing and lets imagine the following three scenarios in the middle of the game your friend dies and the he says hey start it over please ok
or you both die in the middle of a battle or you both finish the game succesfully
either way the only option available next is to select leave game and that means exactly that you leave the gamefor the both of you to play again the same map or whatever you have to do all over again from the very begining load the game select the map wait for the map to load invite your friend wait for your friend to accept invitation wait for your friend to finish loading hisher game select your weapons start the mission wait for the mission loads for the both of you and then play
and you have to do that every time there isnt a room where everybody can wait for more players to chat to select missions combat styles weapons difficulty etc
when one dies heshe can still speak with the other players this is a good difference between this game and the other versions but that is because the dead player cant go anywhere but out of the game there is no room to return toat least i grew tired of this pretty quick so i just play this game on solo and for now i play conflict global terror online at least until a new good game comes out
oh and i have my  console but since i dont have friends who have one i didnt buy the  version of gr and when for the original but now i think i should have bought the  version since i will be playing this game just on soloblah
what happened to the old school versions of ghost recon
i bought this game first day it came out so excited to play it
i played the very first stage and never played it since then it is very off topic
i dont like this game at all
i thought this game was going to turn out like every other great ghost recon madenegative featuresthere are only  squade members not both members have same weapons not their own uniquegame play has very compicating controls and commandsthere are few health packssquade member dies to easilyu have to constantly command your memberfinallyits first person mode so u cant see alot of your surroudingsposotivesi like the fact that its onlinegreat graphics sound and gameplay thats about itin this case change is not goodthe one major problem that i have with this game is that it seems very short and small
compared with the other games in the series curse of darkness doesnt have as many secrets or hidden items to find
for example you could spend months trying to acquire all the extra stuff in symphony of the night
and lament of innocence had hundreds of hidden items
i dont think that the replay value of this game is very high and the gameplay controls especially the camera angles were not very smooth
i got the feeling that konami rushed this game to get it to market
the storyline wasnt as interesting as previous games
even when it is considered independently of the other series games it just isnt all that great
i think that the money could be better spent elsewherethis game is just like any other of the castlevania franchisethe plot is way to simple and not intriging at allyour girlfriend gets killed by the bad guys and you want revengewow
interesting
it took a genius to figure that one out
anyways the controls are very confusing the character just looks like alucard therefore not giving it originality as they said it hasgrafics are not too crisp anywaysthe soundscore its nice thou but not as nice as synphony of the nightits not a bad game  but you wouldnt want to pay  on this onewait until it goes down to at least save  bucks and buy a greatest or platinum hitthats my honest advicei was really looking forward to this game
lament of innocence was fun but just well lacking in several departments
cod appeared to have the same graphics engine but they added back in more of the role playing elements and it appeared to have more symphony of the night type attributes so i thought it would be a step up if a small one from loialas i was wrong
i almost bought this game at full price but decided to rent it instead
im very glad i did
this game is in my opinion worse than loi and not fun to play at all
everything comes off as dull and uninspired
yeah you power up with experience but that alone doesnt make it much more interesting
the innocent devils are a novel idea but just dont come off as being that fun even developing them isnt interesting and the ability to create your own weapons and armor from items you find which seemed very cool when i heard about itjust isnt that interesting im afraid
sure there are a ton of weapons but most of them are useless and rarely do you get a weapon that makes you feel like youve really gained an advantage
the stealing ability is just tediousand the cameraoi i hate it
it is hard to control and poorly positioned almost always when you let it go on its own
at first i was excited to hear you could control the camera the static one in loi got on my nerves but it actually made it worse
it is very detrimental to combat and gets confused very easily when action really heats up
plus you cant look up only side to side
this really annoyed me as well
if im given camera control i want to be able to look in all directionsoverall im sad to say i think this is a very poorly designed game and the worst part of all is the level design
huge expansive flat and boring as hell
uninteresting tunnels stretch on and on as you slowly have to run down them and maybe yaawn occasionally battle a few skeletons and yaaaaawn and then you walk through a door to another tunnel exactly yaaaaaaawn like the last
how can they even call this castlevania
there is no platforming even less than what meager bit there was in loi hector runs infuriatingly slow monsters are sparse a pain to battle in most cases repetitive and just plain uninteresting and the environments are just so bland and generic
the environments are even less interesting than loi
and i dont care what anyone says the music in this game isnt that goodi didnt even feel like i was playing a castlevania game
indeed it is castlevania in name only
beyond the name its just an inferior devil may cry clone
as a hardcore castlevania fan i hate to bash it this way but its sadly true
there are hardly any ties to or trademarks of the series
it was cool seeing trevor but thats about it
i have finally given up on this series unless they release a true d castlevania for a console again why oh why cant you just do it
with modern graphics a d castlevania would be a smash and i dont understand why they cant see thisyeah i know im just wishing on stars
castlevania fan or not rent this one dont buy iti enjoy turnbased strategy rpgs but this game is an exception
the characters are plastic badly voiced cookie cutters from any trashy anime and caring about them or their bland relationships is an exercise only fit for the most persistent and bravedo yourself a favor and pick up a better turnbased strategy rpg
i can recommend a few disgaea gladius flawed but fun final fantasy tactics advance and final fantasy tactics a grimoire of the riftunfortunately the wait got longer
this game has soooooo much potential
but just like the rest of the suikoden series it falls short
you cant power level in this game
when your characters dies they really die
the story is slow
the special moves are lack luster
the graphics are boring and sub par and the music is very typical konami
the truth is i keep getting suckered into these suikoden games with the promise of rpg goodness and instead i end up putting  hours into it quitting and selling the thingif your looking for a top notch strategy game this is not it
if your looking for a suikoden game well this isnt it either
this is more of an experimental title that will leave you bored and constipatedhave funafter playing through half of the single player mode and obtaining a rank   on the online component of the game i have decided to warn everybody about this game
the single player mode is boring
it is repetitive
the bosses are recycled
hooray for fighting the same boss  times with another cheap gimmick added in to make it more difficult
weapons they are terrible
to be blunt there are three useful weapons in the game imperialist missiles and that freeze gun
out of most of the people i play online i gathered some data of different players and found that approximately  players  would rather chase people around in their altform morph ball etc
rather than have a firefight
balance the other weapons with the exception of the  weapons i mentioned above are peashooters compared to those three
i will explain this is detail later
glitches i have counted over  different glitches that can be used to give an unfair advantage of the glitcher
for example you can fire a missile at the floor and launch yourself through a wall
from there you can safely shot everybody without having to worry about getting hit by gunfire because they cant hit you when you are behind a wall
matchmaking frequently i find myself being matched with rank s highest rank which basically means good game for you loss
you are either matched with a completely new players or b top ranked players
communication the friendcode system is completely unnecessary and not being able to do anything but a  player freeforall on wifi just gets plain repetitive
exploiting using the freezing gun i mentioned earlier forget the name and the hunter noxus you can use his affinity weapon to freeze people who are nowhere near you and three shot them with the freeze gun to their head
levels there are  levels that are nearly identical to  other levels but just have an extra room or have the weapons relocated for further frustration
hunters two of the hunters completely suck
no variety
i have once gotten into  separate games inarow that everyone picked the triggerhappy hunter trace
level design absolutely horrible
levels like head shot or weapons complex just make me want to drill a hole in my game
its almost as if nintendo never thought of designing levels specifically for capture or survivalin conclusion i find this game extremely frustrating and nowhere near rewarding for completing goals within the game
if nintendo had thought more and looked at other fps games for inspiration and ideas i think this game would have been five times better
not impressedspend your money on something else this game is not worth purchasingmy wife and i are fans of the original animal crossing on the gc
we were so hooked on that game
lol well she and i purchased the ds version a few days ago
she and i are hooked on that one too
lol  i have logged a good  hrs so far in just a few days on it
and my wife has a good number of hours logged herself
  if you enjoyed the gc version you will definitely love this one too
and for us adults out there dont be afraid to play this game
sure it looks kiddie but man its fun
lol  but as one guy said the fun does wear off as time goes on
but believe me you do get loads of enjoyment out of this title
i love the fact that there are many more species of life in the ds version namely the saltwater fish
i caught a shark yesterday and it was too cool
i do see where the gc version is better than its ds counterpart but thats no real biggie bc its still a blast for item collectors
there are once again so many things to collect and catch and such
the one thing in this game that really ticked me off is that i found out that i cannot get tom nooks nookingtons with the barber shop in it due to the fact that i am not connected with wifi and such and i only have one ds as well
i also only have a dialup connection in my home
so it appears that the main store with the barber shop is offlimits for my wife and i  that is really really so irritating to me
hence the  star overall rating
to me this was unforgiveable since the gc version i had no trouble getting the department store all by myself with my one copy of ac
nintendo should have thrown in another way to get nookingtons for those like me out there in the gaming world
but to sum up this title if you are ok with a cutesy game with an addictive collecting theme then pick this one up
its nearly as fun as the gc version and worth a lookthis is a very openended game in that there isnt any quests to go onor any real goals other than collecting fish and bugs or any real character developmentor story
you simply wind up in this town filled with a bunch of talking animals that you can interact with
you can also expand your house and customize your outfit but why
it doesnt effect anything in the gamealso it throws a hissy fit every time you have to cut the game short for some reason
when you start back up you have to listen to this long ingame lecture about how youre supposed to save at your house first so that you dont undue anything that might have happened in the course of playing
i can see the logic in that since it involves online play but still its annoying
i dont need scolded by my own gamethen theres the online play
online play is just about the only way to make this game interesting
it allows you to connect with other players and visit their towns ect
but the problem is you cant go online unless you already know someones friend code
and how exactly can you find out someones friend code if you cant go online an meet them
no one else i know owns this game which says something in itself so i guess im out of luckthis game is going in my resell pile thats all there is to it
maybe other animal crossing games are betterboy peter jacksons king kong keeps proving to be a disappointment
first theres the movie  about one hour too long and unredeemably boring for a monster ape movie
now theres the gamemaybe its a fun game but i played it for an hour and kept dying at the same spot
this was partly due to the handicaps that come with a first person perspective
with no peripheral vision i often got killed by something just to my right  left that i couldnt see coming in time
another weak spot was the lack of ammunition
perhaps thats realistic but its annoying to be killed by monsters when i have a gun but ive burned all the bullets
you can use spears but theyre hardly effective especially when you fight five or six monsters
plus you dont have a health meter so after two or three hits you just die unless you can get to someplace safe and recover
very irritatingeven worse i didnt get to a single kong stage before i got too bored and frustrated to play any more
just like the film kong is relegated to a secondary role in his own gamemaybe if id stuck with it a little longer i wouldve liked it
but a game shouldnt make you work that hard to like it
it should be entertaining not annoying
and you shouldnt get stuck on the first level
especially when youre an experienced gamertheres a lot of annoying voice acting too
its not the acting itself thats bad but the sheer repetition of it
anne must say oh my god at least once a minutehighly recommend you skip this and find an old copy of war of the monsters insteadi read intreguing reviews but the game is dull and over sensitive and ultimate it  defeated my interest in playingkid just not in to this game very much 
i dont know why 
it looks good with the grafics i played this game all in one night just to beat it because i didnt want to play it
here are my negative experiences followed by the positive  the setting graphics are way too dark
in a cave or in the jungle when it rains and its cloudy its just too dark for my liking
what really gave it a negative on the graphics was when king kong is seen for the first time
that moment when he is coming from the deep jungle to take anne  i was exhilirated to see what this scene will look like  it was terrible
i was hoping to get a little scare out of it or some dazzle at this remarkable beast
but no he started off as a black fuzzy picture and when he came into being the graphics being dark as well made him look like a mess
it looked like somebody scribbled mascara on the screen i had to start the game over from the beginning on two occassions
its bad enough when its one but this was two
the first time is when i saved it on a level and played it the next day one of the characters wouldnt move
i was suppose to follow him to a door so he can help open it cause you needed  people to open it
so i tried restarting the level it wouldnt let me it just put me where i saved it and i tried playing the level before and continuing but after i beat that level and came to this level still the same
so i had to start all the way at the beginning again
i wasnt too far into the game though
well on the second occassion i got twice as far
i didnt manually save it i figured it would have been autosaved to that level but there is no autosave
so im like omg what happened to my game
so now im just like i want to finish this game and never play it again
which brings me to my next negative  i beat this game in one night
it took about  hours
i had just got done beating tomb raider and halo  halo  took the longest time i loved that so much
great game
but wow it turns out this game plays for  hours and has no replay value whatsoever
my next negative  all the characters say the same thing when you click on them its so dumb
all you will hear jack driscoll ask carl is hey carl you hanging in there
it would be nice if carl told me where i had to go cause sometimes i didnt know what to do or if he could give me a clue
but nothing why even have that feature if you cant communicate the puzzles are really easy
i wouldnt even call them puzzles
honestly it doesnt even have puzzles
tomb raider legends that had lots of puzzles that was an awesome game
i loved halo  to death and when i played tomb raider i liked tomb raider more than halo because of the puzzles and because shes so hot and serene
i loved that game
and thats where we really stand between ratings
i dont see how someone can give this game  stars
when theres halo and tomb raider
halo is  star fps and tomb raider is  star puzzle
i would rate call of duty  star fps but king kong comes far short of those games
but this game is  so why not have it in your collection
one more negative  the entire game revolves around this  kill the monsters find fire and a door lever
thats it
honest to god thats all youre doing on every level the entire game is finding fire to burn the bushes and a door lever to open a door
now you can see why i wanted to beat this game to get it over with
and is why i gave this game  stars overall
but it got  stars for fun because of some positives  youre treking through a jungle and caves with dinosaurs and big creatures
it was a pretty adventurous setting i felt i like the spears and bones as weapons
being able to throw spears at a creature then being able to take that spear and use it again is cool
after a couple times though the spear will break
i liked throwing my spears at creatures rather than using a gun
it makes it more challenging
if you run out of ammo in your gun though it sucks lol
but that makes it challenging too is using the spears and bones you find along the way as your only weapon until you find a crate with a gun in it you play as kong who needs no gun or spears overall  for this game definately and i recommend buying it
you can live without it though
soon youll beat it and probly not play it again cause all you do is search for fire and a door lever
even though i gave it a  star review it deserves  just cause its king kong
there should have been more imagination behind it though
this game could have been more elaborousthis says its for the  but the game i received was formatted only to play on the original xboxi sold this game quick and in a hurry
it was the first prince of persia game id ever played so i wasnt real sure what was going on in the first place
and after falling off walls to my deaths over and over and over again i started getting soooo annoyed
this game is horrible
dont buy iti bought this game with the intention of seeing amazing graphics and spectatular next gen action and well that isnt what i got
i play on a panasonic hdtv and this game does not match up to next gen hd graphics its just like ghost recon  this game is not worth the buythis game is annoying
it really takes work to master all the controls
from aiming to switching between weapons reloading crouchinglying downtaking covergogglesbattlefield map etc etc this game probably has the most complicated control system of any shooter
then you have to gain competence deploying all the various resources the game gives youat the same time while taking fire from enemies
at many points you command your squad which is walking with you plus a ground vehicle plus a helicopter plus an eye in the sky reconnaisance drone
the wheeled vehicle helicopter and drone have no ai so they dont do anything unless you command btw
not to mention controlling your actual character at the same timethe other problem is the fact that the character just moves really slowly
he aims slowly he reloads slowly he does everything way slowly and that gets you killed but quick
the aiming is just painfully
freaking
slow
dudes will blow you away while you try haul your gun around
id say the character moves his gun at about  the speed a person in real life would
when you have the scope up on the rifles that speed gets cut to about  the speed it would be in real life
ridiculously frustratingthen theres the fact that you can be blown away with just a couple of shots from enemies whose targeting is impeccable and who are camouflaged really well
add to that the fact that it is about  million miles and a thousand bad guys between save points and that any type of healing is even more rare than the save points arei like hard games
i really enjoyed rainbow six vegas for example depsite the fact that some levels are just killer like the dark construction site at dantes
but graw is just too freaking complicated and difficult in an annoying way
not in a challenging wayan annoying way
like when you get continuously blown away and have to restart the level at a point waaay back and kill the same  dozen dudes all over again
and again
and again
and again
ive been playing this for quite a while now and despite having long ago mastered all those darn controls and commands im throwing in the towel
too frustratingi wanted to like this game
ive been a long time fan of strategy gamesthis one is horrible
moving the units around using the joystick on the psp is extremely tedious
but i supposed i could have gotten over that if the game was any goodunfortunately the ai is braindead and poses absoutely no challenge
even when massively outnumbered the ai is incredibly easy to beat
thus theres absolutely no challenge here just the tedium of going through each map and the story is so moronic and dumb its beyond beliefmaybe this game has a good internet mode but if i wanted to play a game on the internet why wouldnt i just use my pcjust ok at best
i expected more but i guess it makes sense they were in no hurry to get this popular title onto xbox
because it has little to offer
graphics are no big deal
fun factor is moderate to low
not much originality or inspiration here either in the design gameplay or story
but i want to collect xbox games since there will be no new stuff for the old system
ill probably never bother to finish this gamethis game has good and bad parts
it is fun and can last a few weeks of fun
but it is exremely hard
it is confusing and the camara sucks
it is better to get grand theft auto for almost the same price but better funi had a very hard time getting into this game
it sounds cool got good reviews but just didnt work for me
i think they tried to do too much with this and it ends up being a mosh of controls and a strange mix between tactical execution and strategic planningthis is an innovative game in many ways and most missions are a lot of fun
especially cool is the ability to go from armchair admiral to the thick of the fighting with the press of a button and back againhowever this game has a serious flaw
there are no save points or check points
you die and you start the entire mission over from the very beginning and some of the missions and shipsubmarine challenge missions are very long and very hardtherefore the game can get frustrating especially on the hardest veteran level
after your shipsubplane goes down a few seconds before victory you end up asking yourself do i really want to spend another  minutes setting up my approach
or go to a game that has save pointsthe x series are great games unfortunately playing this classic is complicated on the cube
the controls are awkward to the point where it is nearly unplayable and there is no option to change themokay just another mario game wouldnt recommend just dont really get into the mario games thought my son would like it gets bored easy with iti love mario kart and have been a fan of the series but this one didnt impress me as muchsure its fun but the fact of the matter is in order to unlock characters and cars you have to race  times on the same tracks
there are only  i may addgraphicsstill the same mk graphicssoundeach track has a different tunecontrolsvery easy to mastermultiplayerunlike other mk games where you could only race on  tracks you can now race on any track or do battlevery funonline playyou know when i saw that it had online play i got all excitedi got really good at the game and then tried against othersi was really disappointed at what i sawpeople where hacking so that they could win in  seconds or using the technique snakingi dont care what you want to call it it is cheatingi know how to do it but i dont see the point in doing it
its just the race to see who can cheat fasterin the older mks you had to win straight up and not with this stupid snaking stuffplayabilitymoderatelyhighoverallonline play kills the enjoymentmy recommendationif you dont like repitition then dont buy the gamefirst of all let me preface this review by saying that i have never been a fan of the mario kart series
but back in early december  i bought a nintendo ds and didnt have any games to play on it
i had subscribed to gamefly so i could start renting them but wanted something to play until the games from my gamefly subscription started rolling in
even though id never been into mario kart i kept seeing rave reviews for this game and people were going nuts over it so i figured why not
maybe this game was somehow better than the mk games that came before it
and even though mario kart ds apparently combines the best aspects of the versions that came before it at the end of the day its still mario kartmy biggest problem with this game is its sense of speed  basically there is none
if youre used to playing racers like fzero and burnout this thing moves at a snails pace
i heard that it speeds up once you unlock more cars but you have to plod through a bunch of races using the crappy cars in order to get to that point and thats just too much work for me
my next gripe with this game are the weapons
i can deal with the banana and green shell but some of the weapons cough lightening cough blue shell cough are just cheap  these are the kinds of weapons that you have no chance of avoiding
youll be in first place and get nailed by a weapon that you had no chance of dodging and suddenly you findyourself in th or th
this makes the entire game tedious and annoying to play
another gripe in this game is the audio
nintendo seems to have a knack for including the worst music possible in a video game
ill be glad when portable gaming progresses to the point where custom soundtracks become possible because the music in games like this just makes me want to turn the volume all the way downso what about the wifi feature
well i dont have a wireless router so i went to my local mcdonalds hotspot to check it out
the setup was extremely easy and i was playing online in less than  minutes after starting the game
however playing against other humans seemed pretty much like playing against the computer cept that the humans were a lot better
i think i came in last every time
the service itself is great  its just too bad they kicked it off with such a shoddy gamein the end i just dont understand the draw to this game
to me it seems like a pretty lame racer with cheap weapons and cartoon characters
im still waiting for a ds port of fzero
fzero is not the beallendall of racing games but it would certainly be better than thisthis after market  pin connector works but hardly gets the job done
the games have to be pushed as hard as i can to make sure they are fully connected with the connector
 i have an even harder time getting the games out
next time im going to spend the few extra dollars to ensure a quality connectori actually liked this version better than the pc game
to me it was easier to understand and the controls are really good i just couldnt get into the pc game
the biggest problem is the no saving more than one game at a timeeven tho this is a fun game the reason i gave it two stars overall is because i can never finish a game
i get the highest rating for my zoo i have plenty of money i have no more than  or  exhibits and then it wont let me buy anymore not even a trashcan
this is extremely frustrating
this happens every time i start a new game
i have friends who own this game and they dont have this particulat problem but they have other glitches
this game should have had better testing before it was released
i really hope they fix the glitches and release a second onezoo tycoon ds is a fun portable version of the tycoon series
i enjoyed discovering the secrets such as selling offspring to make more cash than admissions revenues every month
after playing the addicting scenarios i moved on to the freeform games where the user is given a large map and  in cashmy park had  cages with the animals that breed frequently  lions zebras buffalo and the tigers
the idea was to see how much cash i could accumulate by selling the offspringafter  months in the first year my game locked up cold
i tried loading the game over same result after a few scenario days
i retried the freeform game with the same effect in three monthsthe game has now unfortunately joined the ranks of shogun empires ds rebelstar tactical command gba and might  magic ii gc as buggy titles that should not have been releasedpros  simple but powerful interface  replayable  through tutorialscons  statistics only kept for two months  game locked upday of reckoning  when i read up on the previews and such seemed to have nothing much new going for it save for a totally new graphics system which was supposed to make the wrestlers look more realistic along with the usual updated rosterunfortunately thats pretty much all it has going for itaside from the basic new stuff better background music without the damn rap music new moves new roster the graphics system does look a little better from day of reckoning however at the expense of totally screwing up the create a superstar optiondue to the new graphics flesh system the create a superstar option is much more tricky and complex to deal with and in most all cases with my characters they come out looking like monkeys or pigfaces
their skin is always blotchy and discolored like when you spill milk on a white fabric and let it dry for a week or so
the faces are virtually impossible to work into a passable human mold and the presets all look like hideous inhuman creatures with comically oversized or undersized features all the females have tiny squinty eyes and fat lips all the males have gorilla noses and square headsso they have totally messed up the cas system as well as another horrible new addition making it impossible to reedit attributes once youve already set them so if you give your char  speed and  counter realize your mistake and try to fix it you cantalso the ai is much much worse from the first one
it seems to have been unnecessarily dumbed down in order to make it harder for the player perhaps
well they succeeded in the most ass way possible
the ai is always out to get you
they dont particularly care about each other in ways or ways or royal rumbles
if you so much as look in their direction they will literally turn on you and attack you nonstop until theyre attacked by someone else
they also dont see any need to put on an actual match choosing instead to try and counter all your moves then use the resulting energy to perform their specials on you and end the match as opposed to the original day of reckoning ai which sought to try and beat you up rather than reverse all your movesone thing else small but noticable
while the ring appearance and movement is slightly smoother than in the original due mostly to the new graphics system theyve done away with the screen rattling and flashing in the original such as the white flash when someone reverses something or that boneshattering crash when you perform a special on someone and ko
them so it is much more stable than the original
this is not a pro or a con as the shaking may have annoyed some people or have entertained some i liked it though as it added a more thunderous quality to certain moves and bumpsall in all a disappointment and not worth spending full price on
its pretty much exactly what the title says day of reckoning   no subtitle nothing particularly brand newokay
the big thing with me is the game is a whatif
scenario
whatif ash never went back in time army of darkness never would have happened and instead ash was arrested and put in a mental institution
this is like saying what if marty never went back to the s in back to the future part  but instead helped doc fight terrorists
guess what
if marty never went back it would suck and there would be no point to continue a story in that direction
it would be horrible
just like this gameyeah the controls and gameplay arent horrible
i was in the woods in broad daylight in one level and im likeumm this isnt that entertaining or scary the levels are kind of cool but nothing to flip out about
ash also has a harpoon for an arm as an optional weapon
just stick to the chainsaw people
now its just getting fruity with all the weapons like the flamethrower blood sucking piece of crap thing that doesnt really work and probably the dumbest weapon machine gun
a lot of those weapons were from fistful of boomstick
but this game just helps keep a horrible tradition going
also some of the enemies are dumb
like the flying ones the big fat thing sam rides on and the ones that look like the grim reaper
totally out of place
and theres one part where ash has to defend sam against the flying guys and that part sucked
i had to redo it because a lot of my shots went through a certain enemy at a certain point
yes one good film franchise is being gutted and stuffed with fruity elements of todays all too horrible video games when it gets adapted to the video game medium
stupid enemies stupid weapons this is based on the evil dead film franchise people stick to the things that made the film franchise so great
and stupid characters you dont care about ie
samwhen someone was on drugs they thought it would be a good idea to give ash a sidekick who is more humorless and annoying than helpful
sam and ash bust on each other for practically ever minute of every second in this game and its supposed to be hilarious
it gets very annoying after awhile
just shut up and get alongbut the biggest thorn in my side is the ending
its pure crap
the biggest jip youll ever get in lifewhen i first turned on regeneration and saw the graphics i was very impressed and thought this was going to be a step forward from fistful of boomstick
some of the scenery was done very well
but unfortunately they seemed to have spent so much time making the game look good they forgot to make actual play equally as excitingregeneration starts off in the cabin in the woods
it was good to be back there and i was excited to see they brought the story line back to the creepy cabin
but just as youre getting into it that level is quickly over
it was more like an intro
so you then find yourself in a mental institution that became possessed and over run with deadites
perfect
what more could you ask for that a creepy hospital building
well again before you know it the level is over and youre out of there
having not done much at all
the line of travel is mostly limited to one hallway
you never get to search out and find hidden areas and objects
no challenging puzzles or objects to find and later use someplace else like in boomstick
its very simplistic and quickly over
what a let down
this seems to happen throughout the game
although i will admit as the game went further on it did improve slightly
but it just wasnt challenging
the game constantly tells you what to do and never lets you figure things out on your own
you walk near an elevator the triangle icon appears on screen and tells you to push the button
never letting you figure anything out on your own
there are so many cinematic cut scenes that youre constantly watching the game like a movie and waiting to actually play
there arent as many interesting weapons to pick up as you go along either
some of the execution cut scenes are cool when killing deadites but over all i was let down by the lack of challenge of this game
the sam character  voiced terribly by ted raimi  is just horrible and makes game play annoying at times
picture scrappy doo doing a joe pesci imitation
but so completely typical and over the top
just not funny at all
when youre controlling sam in certain scenes the music that comes on is just silly cartoonish music that doesnt fit with the scary theme of the game at all
almost points out how stupid and unfitting the character is in this game
i love the evil dead movies and enjoy bruce campbells character and voice over a lot
but believe it or not the earlier more simplistic looking fistful of boomstick was much more enjoyable
hopefully theyll make some major improvements to actual game play the next time they take a shot at the evil dead series
and take a lesson from terrible characters like scrappy doo and jar jar binks
dont bother
skip them entirelycastlevania  in the sequel to the original castlevania but its completelly different   you have to bo back and forth in the cenario  its not a linear game  i dont like this type of games and the ending is horrorible the worst ever madeim lost as to why so many people love katamari
this is a horrible game for anyone over the age of   i played this game for a total of  min
and turned it off
i wish i could have those  min
of my life back
after  min
i was shocked it stunk so bad considering all of the good reviews but then i decided to give it  more min
just to see if it got any better
well it didnt
rolling a ball around of junk and collecting more junk to add to the ever growing ball is plain idiotic and boring to me
i still cant believe how boring and stupid this game was as well as how incredibly bizarre it was
you roll up various things in a ball while listening to the horrible japanese techno playing in the backgroundive played thousands of games in my  years of life and we love i hate katamari is in my bottom   in conclusion i think most of the reviewers must have been on drugs while playing because we love katamari is garbage or it should only be used as a paper weight or used to freak out some old folksfun  stars if i could give it negative stars overall  only because the graphics werent terrible they were just bad and i do give the game credit somewhat for being originali am so tired after finishing this game this is what i found hard about it fighting it is a fighting game but boy do the computer have some cheats and can get you frustrated
this unique fighting system of just smashing buttons gives you the cramps and blocking does not exist its more like dodging and believe me you get hit a lot but your enemies can block
graphicsmusic really good but if the game is so frustrating what does it matters
storyline its allright you got to complete a series of missions
over all fun factor you only get one to amax of three points to built your character fighting power and defense it takes long the missions can be frustrating and at the end it seems like no matter how tought you built your character it still sucksgolem can be very dificult
if you find getting your finger and forearms tired then you will find this funthis review is in reference to nancy drew last train to blue moon canyon game  strategy guide editionive played  or  of the drew games
this one played faster and was over before the time it took to install the gamebefore i had installed blue moon canyon i had installed morrowind the game of the year edition which sold for five dollars less than blue moon canyon
morrowind is a huge  disc game that has at the bare minimum  hours of gameplay and possibly might literally be endless
the entire morrowind set had been installed and up and running within  minutesafter i had installed and played blue moon canyon we installed and got up and running age of mythology gold also within  minutes
this is another massive game a real time strategy game that included the expansion pack the titans
both mythology games were completely installed
this is another game that can be played and explored for years
the two game set sold for five dollars more than blue moon canyon or the original full retail price of the strategy guide edition
the last train to blue moon canyon took so long to downloadwe went out for dinner and let it download while we were gone
we have a p at ghz an gb hd of which only gb were used and  gb of ram
there is no reason on earth why nancy drew games should take so long over an hour to downloadunless their copy protection program conflicted with our toshiba supermulti drive driversthe actual installation was not as painful as the download
what was painful was the gameplay
i had a lot of fun playing the secret of the old clock
whereas most of the amazon user reviews came across as lukewarm to the game i liked playing the golf game and the car chase and the bank shots of reflective light beams to be aligned
i even felt proud when i finally got the sewing completedi knew that the drew games wouldnt deliver the value that the two games mentioned above did
but after the reading the reviews of blue moon i expected to have more fun than i did with secret even though i knew it would be short livedwhat a let down
the game was over in two or three hours
most of the gameplay was a memory test of what order what button was pushed or stick was knocked over or  which way the track leaned to
the arcade games in the general store were just hit the button or in this case click the mouse
you didnt even have to look
the most complicated task was getting a piece of paper to do a rubbing
it was very boringbetween the price the concern over the length of the download the most unimaginative gameplay set to walking back and forth on a train i cannot recommend this game as being fun
it had a few moments with the mathscale problems but it wasnt enough to carry the game or balance the huge amount of needless dialogue the player has to endure listening toi realize im an adult but the eight yearold little girl i bought it for lost interest after the first  minutes
she was wiser than isorry nance this one is a waste of money and might contribute to hardware damage with driver conflictsmarfi had high expectations for fable but was very disappointed
what was touted as the final fantasykiller back in  turned out to be very lame in most respectsstorythe story has a few interesting elements that get quickly devoured by mediocrity
dont expect to attached to the cast as the character development is limitedgraphics  musicthe graphics and music are the two best things the game has going for it
the score is great its a pity that there arent any great characters for the music to highlight
the graphics are nice too but the world of fable is divided into tiny levels the size of a nintendo  game
speaking of the levelsgameplaycombat is too slow and choppy for an actionrpg
imagine kingdom hearts but a lot slower and with much less variety
and smaller levels
for me fables biggest problem is its level design
the entire game is a sequence of tiny paths honeycombed together into dungeons towns etc
you could argue that many rpgs are like that but fable lacks any illusion of freedom
mentally i just couldnt immerse myself into the gameworld
forests amount to paths inbetween chunks of treewalls
i guess ive been ruined by morrowind and more recently world of warcraft as i now demand a very wideopen gameworld in an rpg
the fact that this was developed for the xbox a console with severe memory limitations compared to a pc is not a good excuse as final fantasy xii a ps game feels huge compared to fable
fable also feels too flat
where are the huge towers deep labyrinths and giant mountains found in games going all the way back to zelda ocarina of time
where are there any complex structures at allfables gameplay is stale and the level design strangely small and basic
there are a few amusing morality choices to made in the games cities but these choices are shockingly dull considering how hyped this facet of the game was before release
unless you are younger than  or havent played any rpgs in your life avoid this onei wish i had listened to the people who said this game was buggy
it played ok the first few days but the longer i play it the worse my problems are getting
my twoyearold dell computer exceeds the minimum system requirements
one thing i dont like about the game play is that some sequences take an hour to complete and you cant save in the middle
now that the game crashes during saves i probably will not be able to finish it
i tried reloading the game but it didnt fix anythingi bought this game expecting to be able to have more flexibility than id ever had before
now i just wonder where i got those expectations
your character
you have to be male and human and while you can get haircuts and tattoos gain weight and of course age that is the full extent of your ability to customize him
he always starts out as a darkhaired blue eyed pale little boy and stays pretty close to that
though you can get married dont expect much from that you wont get the level of character interaction you would get out of the sims much less the kind of romance offered in rpgs like baldurs gate
gameplay
you hackslashcastshoot your way through a linear plot and if you so choose a handful of side quests
hardly an embarassment of choices there
its acceptable for a shooter but i didnt buy a shooter
as for the moral choices
the clothes my character wore had more effect on his attractivenessscariness than his moral choices
besides most of the choices are simply shallow kill a few bandits here to get some good points kill a couple merchants there to get some bad points
crime will get you bad points whatever your intent
and so on and so forththis is not an rpg unless every shooter where you play the role of a spy or marine counts as an rpg
this is run around and kill stuff with a few weakly executed rpg trappings
if that sounds like your kind of game dont let me stop you
if you like rpgs dont botherplaying this game on the computer is a pain and a half
ugh i wish i could easily sell this game or something
manincorrect supplies can cause moving lines on the screenthis one did that
just try and track down an oe one and save yourself the troublerather than give you a long winded review on why you should and shouldnt buy it let me just list the pros and cons of the game from an experienced explayer level  rdm and let you decide for yourselfprosexcellent community if playing with players over the age of addicting strategic battle systemintricate and easy crafting systemgreat amount of battleplanning and mob huntingexcellent graphics even for a dated game runs great on most pcsgreat variety in amount of jobs being able to play three new jobs are expected withthe upcoming expansionwas the best pc online rpg out on the market before world of warcraft was oncons flawed party system
you must party in order to gain experience and level time consuming game
after level  you must quest in order to get to higher level areas to fight
quests are hard to find and arent always successful  time consuming to get items
crafting system while easy is not cost effective early on which means you lose money and are always broke  experience parties dont get any good drops which means you must quest for decent nodrop items
these quests consume more of your time  flaming community sites
while playonline doesnt run an official forum on their website allakhazam and killingifrit do
they are quite possibly the least moderated and most flamed forums ive ever seem higher levels level  is capped have a huge demand on artifact  gear and crimson gear
you must quest quest quest every day for at least two months in order to get all the gear you need
this also means you need to go to areas like sky ballista dynamis and various other nm hotspots as well
you also must help out your linkshell teammates get their items too which wastes even more of your time  after level  expect to be playing this game at least  hours a day if you want to get anywhere
want to join an exp party or run dynamis with guild mates
cancel your plans with your friends tonight youre not going anywheremy overall opinion of ffxi population left for world of warcraft
most of them never came back
i was hard headed and stayed the course in ffxi never realizing how much time i wasted in this game until i was  with nothing to do except lot for gear and fight endgamethis game is so very time consuming
you have to be glued to your computer in order to play in the higher levels
lower levels were a lot more fun no commitments all parties
this game has become corrupt though from all the inflation of prices on the servers bad community kids and level  newbies who use bots in order to get high level mob pulls before everyone elsewant to know what being a high level in this game is like
imagine standing around for three hours waiting to pull a monster that has a  chance of dropping an item you might need
there are  other people around you who also want the same item and they all dont like you
welcome to final fantasyi owned the original version for the gamecube but decided to purchase this after my gamecube broke
needless to say i regret that i did
first off this game has constant frame rate drops
in areas with heavy vegetation the drop in fps is very noticeable
secondly when trying to navigate the soil patches there is a lag time between when you push the analog stick to when the character actually movesgame couldve been fun the original was but the technical issues prevented me from enjoying it
buy at your own riskas a christian myself im thinking this game be about mosesabrahamjesus  walking the parted sea proving abraham loyaltyjesus healing  but nonwhatsoever  even for kiddy game it should been more interestingthe developers need to read their bibles moreyou would think if you truly had god on your side youd be able to produce a better game
however craves the bible game appears to be mostly devoid of compelling content or honestly any kind of christian message at allthe video game is based around a game show
that pins you against either  human or computer controlled characters
it seems decent enough however until you realize there is very little order to how the game is run
each player takes turns randomly jumping onto different points on the game board
one of these pieces is the wrath of god where you lose all of your points for the round if you land on it
just so we get this clear
the wrath of god is completely random and the deserving and undeserving are likely to land on it
nice way to spread the love of godin the final round players have a chance to get some extra points from the tree of knowledge
if you pick any fruit other than the apple you get a lot of extra points
however if you pick the apple you lose all of your points
once again this is completely random and you wonder why you should even try
this game seems to favor focusing on the mean spirited god of the old testament and leave out jesus altogether
once again nice way to spread the love of godthe challenges are both trivia and minigames which consist of questions that are repeated all too often
the game claims to have over  bible questions but you only have access to the questions based on the difficulty you set for the game at the beginning so players get ripped off by not getting the total game experienceone of the best games is the tower of babel
this has the feel of stab your neighbor in the back
otherwise theres just not much fun to be had
most of the games have a christian soundtrack so either youll enjoy the game because you like it or youll enjoy it because the songs are so painfully annoyingas a pastor im embarrassed to see that this is what we christians have to offer the public
if you just want to entertain the kiddies for a few minutes this game is fine
honestly most stories in the bible could honestly make for an awesome gaming experience if we focused on one character such as david
but considering we are to show the excellence of god in all that we do this game falls way too short
there seems to be no message at all about the core belief of jesus and what our message is the great commission
if we are to spread the word we need to start by not making bad video gamesprosthe tower of babel minigame is funcons most of the other games are boring the game mechanics are mushyim surprised at the high ratings here
this game is dull
you pick a character run around a corner and start slashing your way through entire armiestheres no finesse the combos are overrated by others here and theres no chance to kick back and look aroundto be fair thats not the games purpose as far as i can tell
its purpose is to constantly throw you into massive battles against hundreds of enemies
its a buttonmasher with almost no imagination involvedit gets  stars because it looks good and they didnt make it too difficult but theres just no lasting fun in wading into a sea of easilykilled warriors and smashing buttons until your fingers cramp solidtotally dullwhy does relic spend so much effort and money developing such a sophisticated and exciting rts platform and then give it a campaign mode that is just a confusing goatfk of massed enemies and nonsensical storylines
the game was designed to reward subtly matching unit types to enemy strategies but the campaign mode is just a wave after wave of mixed units that must be endured with no time or even need to plan a defense
i feel like ive been given a set of surgical tools and then told i have  minutes to cut dow a tree with them the sophistication of the tools makes the brutish nature of the task all the more frustrating
bad bad job relicill make a confession right up front  i didnt finish this game
life is too short and there are too many other things to do than spend hours on a game you really dont enjoyfrankly i like my games fairly leisurely paced without a lot of running jumping and shooting
but even i thought this yawnproducing game was a bore
click click click  move the character to that room look around try to find a hotspot
then click click click  move the character to another room
talk to each of the other characters again and again asking the same questions
click click clickif a game requires a great deal of environmental exploration the setting must be interesting and this one isnt as far as i got anyway
there is the obligatory large mansion with a large number of items that serve absolutely no purpose and elicit the same remarks from the main character and no way to shut him up once he gets started
compared to a mysttype game or syberia longest journey the broken sword titles etc this is absolutely claustrophobicgame movement is tiresome with static paths that must be followed to get from one place to another and the graphics are mediocrethere is no logic to the socalled puzzles which amount merely to finding inventory items combining them etc
why for instance were the flashlight batteries hidden in the flour sack in the pantry
that makes no sense whatsoeverfinally the game is so linear that it should come with its own ruler
at one point you cant progress to the next stage until youve talked to everyone in the room
miss one of them and you can wander for hours without anything changing
once you get that last bit of dialog in zap
the scene shifts and you can move onjudging from the other reviews ive read im definitely in the minority so perhaps i needed to be more patient with this game
maybe it gets better as time goes on
but have you ever played a game to the end even though it had become a chore just because you hoped it might improve and actually be worth the money you paid for it
i didnt want that to happen to me with this oneanother tedious excersise in the murdermystery genre of adventure gamingwhat starts of as a classy interpretation of the classic novel quickly devolves into your typical wandering itemconversation whats next unengaging gameplay which given its one location will no doubt have players running around and eventually becoming bored at looking at the already static backgroundsonly for hardcore mystery fans people who liked the sherlock holmes or hitchcock gamesthis here game does the equivalent of that old saying one step forward two steps backinevitably im comparing this to the original as it is like knights of the old republic and jedi knight in regards to sequels that do not change the engine or graphicsthings changed from the original battlefront including a deeper more complex hud
the particular units for the clone wars are updated as in clone troopers from episode iii and new special units alongside the old onesthe main campaign is good
it is great
it is genuinely compelling
it takes the form of an old clonetrooper telling the stories of his time in the republicimperial st legion starting with the typical clones vs droids battles and doing some dramatic acting and dialogue that is far better than most of that in the original moviesit is genuinely gutwrenching to hear him talk after the battle of felucia just before order  saying to the effect of aayla secura told us we were the absolute best soldiers shed ever worked with
it was a good thing we were wearing helmets because none of us could bear to look her in the eye
the campaign also does interesting things in having imperial stormtroopers fight kaminoan clonetroopers or stormtroopers against cis droids etceterathe galactic conquest is also changed for good and bad
for good the map is larger and more realistic and bonuses can be purchased with credits as well as unit types purchased
you move your fleet into positions over worlds and if the enemy has a fleet there you engage in a space battle firsta big big big plus units can now sprintfor bad unlike in the first battlefront there is only one level per world one battle to secure it or lose ittwo new features space battles and heroesspace battles are amazing and fun among the best of any star wars computer game in recent history
pilots can either slowly destroy the enemy capital ship from external bombing or infiltrate their hangar and run past enemy fire to destroy their shields or life support or engines or autodefense mechanism from the inside or just keep to destroying enemy fighters on the outsideheroes the heroes that wield lightsabers are disgustingly overpowered fun
they move amazingly fast jump amazingly high and kill amazingly fast
the good part is that they can obliterate dozens at once but they can also die fairly easily so they do not break gameplay
the bad part is that they are reduced to bloodthirsty beasts in the sense that you are timed with them and the more you take damage the more time you lose whereas you gain more time when you kill
if you run out of time the hero dies and leaves but you regain them several minutes laterjust a personal opinion but any hero that is not jedisithgrievous is completely uselessbut now the bad parts buggy
the game is insanely buggy in that it can randomly and very rapidly crash without notice
this happened to me a lot during space battles while i used the boost just to have the game suddenly drop me to the desktop as quickly as if i were closing an mspaint file
as well it also crashes if you play it in windowed mode and alttab away from the game menu
it does not crash if you pause it midgame and alttab out but if you are not on a battlefield and you alttab out it will crash the absolute worst friendly ai ever
on normal mode battles seem to tend to be an even deathmatch in which both sides would completely drain themselves out if it werent for you
but the more you play it the more you tend to see that your side no matter what faction it is is beyond retardedi have had control points lost because one enemy soldier stands upon it while five of my own soldiers stand next to it and do nothing to the enemy soldier
i have seen enemy soldiers run circles around friendly soldiers who cannot shoot it because their aim is abysmalmost disturbing of all friendly soldiers absolutely love to run right in front of you while youre shooting
they absolutely love to wiggle into your line of fire while youre shooting at an enemy
they love to be killed by you because they block your way while youre emptying your blaster into an enemy like a machine gun
they always do this
they do not ever not do thisi do not exaggerate when i say every level where i am shooting at someone and a friendly unit is in front of me and slightly next to me will move out in front of me
most of the time its only once but many times they will keep doing it or stay in front of me elite mode
something is horribly wrong with it
in the game menu you can switch the difficulty from normal to elite
for players like me normal is too easy and elite is too hardthe main thing elite mode seems to do is to make your troops untrained recruits and to make the enemy elite
what it basically does is render your entire army useless and make it a quite literal you vs all of them game experience
that may be fun for some players and experts but for the most part it completely destroys the game experiencei have played levels in elite mode where my side has lost a battle  vs  where i had killed at least  enemies by myself
and we still lost and the enemy still had some  units left
this was not a onetime phenomenon for i played the same level four times under the exact same circumstances and settings and bonuses and it was the same result each time
i murder half the enemy army and the other half murders my entire armythe bad parts outweigh the good parts by far too much
its still a fun game sometimes but as a longlasting highquality game it is a failurei havent played this game much yet i guess that says it all but heres my impression so far
this game is advertised for its great multiplayer yet i had no such experience
for one thing the maps are pretty bad
theyre really small and the whole game simply feels like counterstrike with star wars graphics
sure the graphics are really good but what about the gameplay
well at times its fun but heres my biggest complaint  who are the enemies
for gods sake would it kill them to make it easier to see whos on your team and whos on the other team
in a game like call of duty each side has different uniforms so its obvious
to make it even worse servers use friendly fire
so im running around just trying to figure out who to shoot
some of the weapons are quite cool but i had some problems
would it kill them to put in a description in the game of what weapons do what
i used the incinerator on people and nothing happens
and what all can those tongs be used for
whats going on
granted i should probably read the instruction manual but if i wanted to read id read a bookas far as the space fighting the graphics are great but the gameplay was terrible
i couldnt figure out how to find the enemies in the vastness of space how to shoot them or anything
i think this kind of thing should be somewhat intuitive
i dont play flight sims or anything but i can easily figure out how to fly a plane if you make it intuitiveon the plus side the single player is good so far
im curious as to whether battlefront  is a better multiplayer game than this but im not sure i want to spend the money to find outwhat could have been a great game is ruined by the difficulty mostly due to the bad controls although the same game might perhaps be better on a different platformpersonally i was heavily bored and disillusioned by age of mythology
it had very little replay value for me especially when human infantry are basically useless against myth unitsage of empires iii rather than acting as a sequel to age of empires ii acts as a sequel to age of mythology
the engine is pretty much exactly the same
perhaps thinking the ancients too stupid to build big buildings all the buildings here are maybe  or  times the size of buildings in age of mythology making the map seem very small and difficult to navigate as you seem to run out of space quickly
even ships look cartoonish simply by how massive they are in comparison to the puddlesized river youve just built them intoabout the best improvements made from age of mythology is the population you can have more than a  man army at one time herethere is nothing else revolutionary here its the same old sword with regards to real time strategycivilians dig gold hunt animals or farm cut wood build houses build barracks build church or mosque or temple build infantry mass them attack upgrade build another base somewhere else repeat
the graphics look great but they are highly unimpressive in battle gunfire cannon shots explosions are all unremarkable
the only positive aspect i can say here is that the buildings actually look like theyre taking damage when under firelosing roof tiles chunks of concrete and masonry crumbling offeverything else is just ordinary
the sort of generic unremarkable rts of the next d generation improving where age of mythology fumbled that is army battles but breaking no new ground
native americans indians they have some settlements littered around
you build a trading post next to them and you can train some of their soldiers
mercenaries
the good thing is they dont count towards your population
also you get a few upgrades that only give you a minor edge in battleindepth cities useless
it does nothing
you cant do anything with the cities
instead you get bonus cards which give you little tiny gifts that dont turn the tide of the battle massively unless youve got nothing lefteverything else is about the same old sword youd find in age of empires ii age of mythology and rise of nations
no innovation no revolution no increased challenge nothing new
status quo all the waywhy game companies push away from the d video game for the d feel game is beyond me
most rts games are shown from high up where you can zoom way down and control small battles or zoom out and control an army
aoe iii took away the zoom out  you are so in the face of everything you cant really see what you are doing
maybe the d assetstextures would be too taxing on the system but then thats a design flaw  anyways decent game but i got extremely frustrated with the camerai played the original age of empires both i and ii and their expansions and for the time they were released they were the best thing out easily
for their time they were innovative and brought new ideas graphics and notions to the rtss
however this game does little that is innovative and almost nothing that has not by this time been done in almost any other rts
this game offers nothing new to the marketcontrols consist of simple point and click movement and battles consist of nothing more than moving and clicking as well
there is simply nothing new here
for instance battle for middle earth ii tryed to be innovative with adding battalions rather then units and making battles consist of more then simply point and click
age of empires iii however has the same controls and ideas that age of empires ii had nearly  years agoin terms of graphics i really dont see what is so special about this game company of heroes battle for middle earth ii and rome total war all offer better graphics than this game boasts and all offer gameplay that is simply worlds awayin terms of sound this game also lacks for a good deal with sound being rather bland and the music being rather forgettablethe ai
here is where i was really bewildered the ai in this game is simply braindead
even on the hardest setting expert and with a  resource bonus the ai still seems reluctant to even attempt a large scalle attack against ones base
why
i really dont know it will attack but with only the smallest of forces and only the most meager of strategiesbottomline if you live rts games get battle for middle earth ii get rise of nations or even company of heroes this game simply is outdatedi play aoe all the time and i bought it when it first came out  years ago
aoe  suxsthis will never live to up the the first game nor should it be named age of empiresthis a bad
buy aoe  gold
not this poser gameokay  somethings wrong
i played the trial version several times and the full version and im still not sure what happened
how is it that age of empires  still seems better than this one
okay ill throw out a few points hereif you dont know what this game is about read some of the other reviews check out age of empires  or any other worldconquering game and youll get the idea build conquer rulegraphics sound performance ummm supposedly better
even on my highend rig the graphics werent impressive
so what its d  that doesnt mean anything
its a badlooking d  even with the graphic tweaks cranked up
lose points on this the sound is what it is
it does the job and sounds good  but its nothing earthshattering
nothing really innovative or impressive
not that it should be but a nextgeneration title with advanced graphics and the hardware available today should have a really breathtaking soundtrack for the price as noted i have a highend system and this game performed poorly
other games far more demanding on resources perform flawlessly on the same system
what gives
perhaps its just clunky and seems to be poor in performance nonetheless even if your pc exceeds the minimum requirements listed on the box be wary it may not show in the gamevery disappointing
even if it is loaded with historical information  so are other games and the older age of empires titles
sometimes games that are less graphically dazzling can far outshine newer d based games this is one caseif you havent checked out rise of nations do so  it performs much faster looks great and offers a greater scope of playability than age of empires   if you must have this game then wait until it hits the bargain price range  at best
i give it  stars out of respect for the genre the titles legacy and for other games backed by microsoft that are fabulousfirst of all this age of empires iii game has a lot of potential and promise because it belong in the age of empires series
the other age of empires games were great
this game could of been a great strategy game
its not even close
what a shametwo good strategy games for the same time period is rise of nations and empire earth 
visually age of empires iii has better graphics than the other two games
gameplay wise the other two games are whole lot better
the developer ensemble studios really screwed up on this game
ensemble studios concentrated way too much on the graphics for age of empires iii and forgot about gameplayhere are some examples of what i mean
first when you play in skirmish mode in age of empires iii you cant just stay in one age like you can in rise of nations
your force to play through different ages whether you like it or not
second you cant upgrade units like you can in rise of nations
your units always stay the same and look the same
third your explorer in the game cant just explore on his own on any map like in rise of nations
fourth there is no world map so there is no countries or territories to conquer like in rise of nations
there is no strategy at all
fifth you cant make any of your units or enemy units be in agressive or defensive stances like you can in rise of nations
sixth you cant put units on top of walls to defend forts which is really disappointing
in fact your units on the ground can shoot through walls at the enemy and actually hit and kill enemy units on the other side of the wall
i dont understand how they can do that
seventh can somebody explain to me how does a train in the game that appears out of thin air starts out on one end of railroad tracks and moves along the railroad tracks and the train goes to the other end of the railroad tracks and just disappears into thin air
what happen to the trainhow this game ever made it through the beta stage before it was put up for sale to the public with all these bugs in it ill never know
this game is way overrated and way overpriced
dont buy into all the hype about this game
save your money until the game comes down in price and hits the bargain binif you are looking for a simplified game that wont require too much thought here you go
after playing as many rts games as i have they really these days come down to the features the tech tree the tactical battles and their complexity without being too overwhelming
the tech tree in this game is pretty weak although there are some cool features added but not nearly enough to make up for how over simplified this game is
you get some cool artillery pieces some big ships a few bells and whistles
still this game is surprisingly underdevelopedi cant believe they call it age of empires even the plot has nothing global about it all being focused on the new world
rise of nations spans i think over a dozen epochs with distinct units in each this game doesnt even have half that
aoe iii really has the feel of a little kids game very bubbly and cartoony something that kind of annoyed me about empire earth ii also so if you are buying it for an  year old go for it
if the kid is over  though id recommend rise of nations which is hands down the best rts game since starcraft even beating out the total war series
if you already have ron get empire earth which isnt as good but still beats the crap out of aoe iii
either that or the total war series which are pretty goodwell it has been out for awhile and i have played through it a bit and suffice to say this game is dead
it should have been a new entity alongside city of heroes but for all its flash it is just more of the same
the missions are exactly the same as the hero side of the gamesometimes with just minor word changesyou play through the game and contacts tell you what a big shot you are becoming then in the late  levels all your contacts act like you are a nobody
that sort of inconistant story telling and pacing are just small complaintsbig complaint lack of anything to do but the same tired four or five mission templates
that is right there is a small handful of missions and you will be doing them over and over and over and over
soloing is boring and group play is risky thanks to no solid group dynamicpvp
pvp is a joke
a few powers destroy everything else making it zero fun
if you enter a pvp zone and have no resistance to status effect ie holds sleeps etc you are pretty much a doomed
they say upper level content is coming but they never even came up with decent upper level content for city of heroes the general response was make a new character and that means the same grind all over so save your money this mmo is starting its descent againon the positive side it does have one of the most fun combat systems for an mmo and an impressive character design system
these were positives from city of heroes so it is not like they would downgrade thatthis game was really designed more for a console than a hand held
the controls are difficult to use
riding the horse is tough with the hand held controls
aiming can also be an issue especially when you need to do it quickly against moving targets
i love everything else about this game but the controls really make it so frustrating that ultimately it ruins the game
get this game on a console instead of a hand heldcant belive this game is the remake of first ridge racer  game for the ps control are stupidgraphics are  not for a xbox  quality over all ridge recer game are  a frustrade  experience with the exention of rage racer game that was a classic recer game for the ps
not recomendedwas very underwhelmed by this game quite annoying to play with clumsy controls and functions
tried to play a couple of times before i gave upsomebody sneezed over at ea and this is what came out
i adored bustin out and the urbz immensely enough that every  months i pick them up and play them again
ive had this game for a little over a year now and im not even sure of where it ishere well start with the prosits a sims gamenow on to the conshorrific story linetasks are too easy to figure out and extremely predictablehard to readmanage sims character meters wants desires needs personality relationships etcdespite what other reviews might say graphics are not that greatnot much opportunity to decorate the house or items to decorate withoverall premise of interaction with other sims characters a failure they tried too hard to change it from past games but there was nothing wrong with the way they interacted before if it aint broke guyscant even complete all the levels of the game wo having a gameboy link or whatever that is one gameboy is all ive got one gameboy is all i needthis is definitey a result of ea trying to put a game out too quickly and not taking enough time to develop it
seemed to be a grab at making a quick buckunfortunately i fell for it
shame on you eaafter two hopeless hours of gameplay the game does not deserve a full review
i wish the cartridge was reusable as digital camera memorypros you can customize the door panel graphics of the car you could unlock the ford gt maybe if you didnt own a copy of mario kart ds and were really boredcons no ds download and play option only works with other nfs mw owners graphics under par for the series gamplay engine is hard to control customizing is limited and just a repeat of other need for speed releasesyou have a choice try some other racing gamethis game stalled at the starting lineall show and no golets cut to the chase this game was a huge disappointment from the start
game pad could not configure proper and there are no dead zone adjustments
i spent top dollar on this mediocre gameif that
its all dazzle with no meat on its bones
sure the graphics are nice but the whole game is spoon feed to you with gay track arrow barriers un challenging  lane highway racing and poor car physicsnfsporche unleashed is the benchmark so farmotor city also
it had car physics insane damage that would stay all through the career
if you wanted to keep your  crumpled up or couldnt afford it then thats the way it stayednfsmw has a car customize thing and a nice story mood other then that i just didnt find it fun
the police chases werent enough to bring this game to a positive review
people said you had to get into it
min i uninstalled it only to reinstall it again to see what i was missing  it was a struggle of will to get to the free range mode where it added no enjoymentfor the love of pete ea please go back to your roots on making a solid customizable game that isnt just for show
bring back damageas for the score i dont understand how it gets such good reviews maybe i demand to much out of my race games the more realistic the better
this is obviously  an arcade game an arcade game that has console stylerad racer for nes comparable
written all over it
i feel this has lost the nfs credibilitybottom line rental for console
pc avoid itcoming from years of playing games like counterstrike day of defeat tfc the dark forces series etc i was compelled to give this game a try because of the vehicles and squad tactics aspects of the gamethe game is hard to classify as a game because it seems about  or better of your time is spent running or driving only to be killed by an unseen artillery or air attack
some of the problems with this game are part mechanics part gameplay and part are the behavior of most people who play it
some problems areit takes forever to id someone as friendly or an enemy
ive had times where ive trained my cursor on someone for  seconds without getting a red or blue indicator of sideonly to be shot from behind while im impatiently figuring out if i can shoot without getting a teamkillthe game is often dominated by those who get to the planes and helicopters first
the rest of the players are all just target practice on the ground making it a run die respawn cycle for everyone else
and there are people who will hop in a tank jeep chopper etc
and take off with no one on board leaving everyone else to either go on foot or wait for the vehicles that left to get destroyed and respawngame is somewhat choppy expecially compared to similar hires fast action games
i have a fairly new  beefy alienware computer that eats up doom  and source games like nobodys businesscamping or baseraping
the enemy sits on your spawn point and continually bombards or shoots you the split second you spawn
ive seen this in other games of course but here it seems to be much much more common
the ability to wipe out entires waves of spawners with airstrikes or artillery makes it more seductive for people i supposethe only fun map i played was gulf of oman which not coincidentally is the map you play when you download the bf demo
if i could have contented myself with that i would have saved myself some moneythe sniper is weak
its good that they nerfed it to avoid the oneshot cheapness of other games like the awp in counterstrike for instance but it is so weak it takes more shots to kill someone with a  than it does with a sidearmincredibly slow loading times between gamesnitpicky point here but you cant use mousewheel to scroll through serversso i payed  for  days worth of pointless gameplay
doesnt look like i can get much for it on ebay so this baby is headed straight for the garbage chute
my advice download the demo and play it for free because in that case the price is rightbelieve it or not special forces is in worse shape than battlefield  was when it was releasedea and dice have been slow to address showstopping bugs in the original game and against my better judgement i decided to give sf a shot thinking that maybe some problems would have been addressednopemany people are experiencing a lot of difficulty just installing the game let alone playing it
if you are able to get the game installed and i eventually was youre likely to find yourself up against a host of other problems including severe framerate drops and performance issues even if the original game ran well performansewise which mine didit would be nice if companies like ea and dice were held more accountable for shoddy product they release to their fans especially considering that the majority of their fanbase consists of financiallystrapped college and highschool studentsthis is awfulthis game refuses to load
i sat at the optimizing shaders screen for over an hour with no results
most of the time it stops loading at  other times it even stops at 
ea wont reply to my emails at technical supportits too bad cause i run some pretty nice machinery toofurthermore even if i could play it i probably wouldnt want to since the subject of the game is pretty stupid
instead of allout war its covert operations
better to just buy the rainbow six franchise for that
at least they do a better job at game designafter playing the excellent half life  and its sequel episode one
i decided to blindly purchase this earlier anthalogy
what a mistake
this game feels like it belongs on an atari  as the graphics and sound are an embarrassment to behold
either remake this game or send it out to pasture
what a relicthe graphics and commentary in this game are great however the gameplay is terrible
i have owned all of the fifa titles since   the offense is very difficult to control the players movements are slow and it seems that it takes several seconds for the players to react to your keys when you press a button and by then it is too late passing stopping etc
also unlike the other past fifa titles i spent at least  to  of my time playing defense and its almost impossible to get the ball down to the oppenents goal to score because they always seem to strip the ball away from you
i also own the winning eleven  soccer series
although its more expensive that fifa  i would highly recommend it over this years fifa game
after owning fifa  for less than a week i traded it
if your are still thinking about buying this game rent it firstthis game is a joke
im all for playing sims on console im addicted to sims  for ps but sims  for ps is seriously garbage
some of the basic qualities that make sims such an enjoyable game have been stripped away the most obvious one being the fact you cant have children
story mode is enjoyable for awhile until you realize its more or less pointless and boring
the game is absolutely nothing like sims  for pc at all
sims bustin out will always be the best sims installment for psi bought this on the first day it was released
what a disappointment
it has less functionality than any sims game  as far as building or dressing people or aspirations orwell anythingthe aspirations are stupid
for example if your main character hires a maid that doesnt stop someone else in the house from  wanting to hire a maid days later even though the maid is walking around in front of their face
how dumb is that
the control panels are clunky
you have to pause the game to go find out when your character has to go to work or what they need to advance in their job
plus your ps will grind constantly and dont even get me to talking about the terribly slow load times
bustin out was way more fun  more action and with a lighter sense of humor
plus you can buy it cheap  instead of this overpriced uninspired messthis game had so much potential
great story great graphics
it would have been a fun portable version of the sims  that was much more faithful to the original pc version than the versions for ds and gbaunfortunately the horrific load times and crashproneness ruined that
any time you do anything in this game the game has to load from the disk
and load and load
so youre sitting there listening to it grind and looking at a spinning hourglassthe funny thing is that theres only really about  hours worth of game here but it takes at least three times that because of all the loadingeven worse is its tendency to crash
while i was playing the game crashed several times requiring me to restart my psp and go back to a save file
worst of all it consistently crashed on the games finaleim glad i just rented this one
its defintely not worth what theyre charging for iti was looking for a soccer game that was a quick study and very fun out of the box
unfortunately this game like many in the ea sports line up has become more about being an owner or coach then about the actual game play
you have to keep track of the players health stats injuries and still figure out how to play the game
the other major dig on this game is the stupid thing doesnt come with even the basic instructions of how to play it for example i had to search online to find out why everyone of our shots on goal was missing badly
come to find out that you have to push the button and release just at the right point on a power bar located by the name of the player
playing against another person is fun but playing the computer is a real pain and i felt like it was extremely difficult to get any enjoyment from getting beat over and over
if you want a game thats a fast learn and fun for one person keep looking
if you want to be a soccer manager or play fantasy soccer instead of the actual game this is the one for youi wrote a negative review of this game a few weeks ago but after playing it some more i am coming around
there are still some negatives  which i will address  but overall the game is fun to play even if it takes a ton of practice to finally conquerpositives graphics are great selection of teams you can control has improved managers have even more control including stadium upgrades which arent always visual sometimes just in tickets sold once you learn how to play its a lot of funnegatives defenders still only have to make contact with you to steal the ball you can win the treble and still get fired if you go too far in the hole with your budget which is a bit unrealistic if the other team wants to win you are going to lose no matter how hard you try or how good your players are players retire early or sometimes disappear
i wanted to sign michael owen and even though he would only have been  at the time i was signing him he was nowhere to be found you cant delete previous games and profiles
i have tried everything and have yet to figure out how to delete my old teamsseasonsit took me a long time to be able to play at the professional level much longer than previous versions
now that i have figured it out its a lot of fun
it just takes a lot more patience than previous versionstake the amazing pc battlefield  subtract the keyboard and mouse that make a fps game a dream to play throw in a boring single player campaign downgrade the graphics take the heart of the battlefield games its online play and fill it with bugs and bump the number of players in a game from  down to  and you get battlefield modern combat
i dont think i really need to say more but i will
i didnt have extreamly high hopes for this game in the first place when i saw the number of players that can fit into a multiplayer game
i was mainly hoping that bfmc would have bot battles without mission objectives to worry about to go along with the campaign
well there are no bot battles
yes i have played a multiplayer match in bfmc but it still doesnt fell much like the pc battlefield games before it
when you think about how difficult it is to get xbox live and the fairly small amount of xbox owners that actually have it you realize that online multiplayer isnt enough to support a game on its own
you need good singleplayer or split screen modes too
ea seems to have passed this up and left this games players with a smaller online multiplayer no split screen games and a really boring campaign mode
in the single player campaign you go through multiplayer maps with scripted events and mission objectives
only its not enough like a multiplayer map to generate the same amount of fun
the enemys dont wander the map and act like team players or even attack enemys at will
they only show up where they need to be detracting from the realisim and overall fun
youll know what i mean when you start to walk through a town after not being able to find any action and have  enemy soldiers spawn right out of thin air and shoot you to pieces
the graphics have also been brought down
the explosions are not nearly as nice looking as bf
now i realize that the xbox doesnt have the right amount of hardware as a computer that can run bf but they could at least have had pieces of the vehicles go flying when you blow up a tank or helicopter
instead the vehicle just disappears in a strange cloud of smoke and sparks
no chunks of the vehicle no fragments of metal just poof
you also cannot select a unit type upon spawing
instead you hotswap to another soldier on the battlefield
you can do this at will during the mission and it means the game doesnt end every time you die but it makes it hard to get the types of units to the place theyre needed most as the nearest soldier to hotswap to might be at the completly opposite end of the map
if you have xbox live and arent expecting a reveloution in the xbox live fps you might as well get this game even though there are still plenty of online fps games for the xbox that are much more fun
if you dont have live or arent interested in playing this game on it dont even bother
the battlefield games werent ment to be a single player game in the first placefirst off they ruined the hole concept that was fun about the battleifield series which is total freedom capturing points and what not
they have that in multiplayer which is all you should buy this game for
it would have been awesome if that option was available in single player but no they had to go and change it to some gay story mode that sucks very badlybattlefield  modern combat has vast environments and beautiful textures and with loading times being shorter than expected
but even purchased as the spinoff console version i still expected and hoped the gameplay to somewhat fall inline with the traditonal battlefield gameplay and mechanics i fell in love with on the pc
i would consider this title for dedicated fans of the modern warfare genre who intend to play this exclusivly on live
if youre looking for a coop or offline multiplayer look elsewhere
only six more days til star wars battlefront  you can wait a little longer cant yousims  for xbox had to have been on my amazon wishlist for at least  months even before they had a box shot for it
ive played every version of this series  from pc to ps and onto xbox and havent  been really upset with  its rough pc to console translations
this edition though has three  vital changes from the pc version
first sims do not age
secondly no building of two story homes
lastly  the sims work everyday unlike the pcs  days off per week
these arent features that make or break the solid innovation of the series but the game should have been promoted as a stand alone title and this console version leaves little to be desiredsid meier has gotten to the point in the gaming industry where all he has to do is attach his name to a game and it will sell
pirates
is a game that offers so much promise but it never really quite gets thereyes the game did provide me with several hours of enjoyment
the basic premise of the game is a blast
however each goal in the game is accompanined by a minigame
at first the minigames are nice easter eggs but they get very boring very fastoverall the game needs a lot of improvement
with a little tweaking i believe pirates
had the ability to become one of those games that define a genre
as it is the game seems incomplete
the main quest never stops being enjoyable
the minigames that must be accomplished in order to complete the main quest get unbearably tediousafter reading all the positive comments on both gamespot and amazon about this game i ordered it through amazon with the highest expectations
the result a very mediocre game that is very disconnected and frustratingi have a fascination with pirates ive read several books on the real life pirates of the th and th centuries
while its true that all the stuff you would want in a pirate game is present buried tresure swordfights ship battles land battles etc
etc each of these events are represented in their very own boring and most of the time corny minigameactually navigating your ship is really frustrating
i still havent figured it out
the wind blows in a certain direction and if you are not headed in that direction your ship moves at a snails pace
it takes forever to get from one end of the map to the other
the rest of the minigames are either really boring or just plain corny
for example one minigame involves dancing to impress the governors daughter
dancing around like a fancy boy is not what being a pirate is all about lets get real
ship battles are cool but if your ship is somewhat far apart from your enemy its very difficult to get close to them
for some reason in the ship battle mode your ship doesnt really move at allthe swordfighting is ok but is pretty cheesy and gets boring very quickly while the land battles are excruciatingly slow
its like moving chess pieces
buried treasure i havent even tried yet because the map they give you to find is very difficult to readall in all i really dont understand the high reviews for this game
the game is very disconnected and just really not that fun
i do not recommend this game to anyonethis was not what i expected at all
there are dance sequences where you have to dance with someone and it is just kind of lame in my opinion
and the travelling from port to port is not a lot of fun
i gave this game to a local charitythis game isnt bad and it does have a huge number of players but it isnt all that good either
the game is completely multiplayeronly and the graphics and weapons are more complex on the completely free multiplayer portion of fear
other problems include unimaginative level design by third parties annoying voiceovers and a strange astandard default keyboard layout
personally i feel like ive wasted the  i blew on this game given that i already had a copy of that free game
probably should have held on to my money and used it to pick up the orange box
this game doesnt hold up on its own to warrant blowing any real money on it
its worth fiddling with if you can get it for free or bundled with a good game but it certainly wasnt worth its no secret that im no fan of new wwe wrestling games
i hate the fact that every new game only brings a couple new options
meanwhile the rest of the game is exactly the same as last years wwe game
its just a ripoff marketing strategy in my opinionat least this game has some wonderful graphics to make up for the lack of interesting new features
but the thing is you dont need this game
not just because theres already a million wwe games on the market that are all designed only to impress graphicallyobsessed video game fans but also becausethe playstation  happens to be responsible for the next generation of wwe games and these games happen to have the best graphics to date
so if you like graphics and i know you do just wait for the playstation  wrestling games
then after you purchase them you wont care about smackdown vs raw  anymore rolls eyeswell before i wrote this review i looked at about  others because i wanted to see what they had to say
i am going to repeat a lot of things but i think most people missed some things that were critical
first off the lack of superstars and extra superstars
i want to let you all know about my opinon on each superstar
eddie it was a terrible loss and i wish everyone in the wwe and his family the best
one thing i had a problem with s vs raw  is eddies entrance remember when he told batista that he had changed and they came out to face mnm and he had his old music
well you cannot change his music and and enterance to make him the loveble eddie that we all remember
many superstars left out like lashely finlay gunner scott mnmthey even show mnm on the smackdown theme movie
simon dean and others
on raw divas such as maria the cuttest diva of them all
mickie jamesphsyco spirt squad andothers
also lita doesnt come out with edge
many other things wrong with this game
the biggest problem i had with smackdown vs raw  is that when you are in a match the ref gets in the way all the time so when you are hitting your opponent the ref will stand there and if you hit him on accident he will dq you cost me a title too many times
it also gets kind of annoying when you play batista on the smackdown ring and micheal cole and tazz will argue about batista not being on smackdown
hello
he is
the legends are kinda cool but i wish they had more
i noticed alot of people wanted lesner as a legend and i agree
next to batista rey eddie he was my favorite superstar and i guess i will have to go and buy hctp again to use him and f my opponents
i heard that they are doing smackdown vs raw  and i would love to see dx on there
also the season was way to short and they only had one storyboard for each show
on raw you fight edge and christian for the tag team titles and if you win they take the titles away from you because you were not the orignal title holder regal was
and on sd you face off against some legends that is real funsarcastic
the last thing is the manager modes what a joke
they should have made it to where it was like a storyboard where if you where teddy long you could interupt to for example rey and jbl and tell jbl that he has a handicapped match aagainst big show and kane or someting
plus you cannot make title matches in normal show except ppvsthis game is very overrated
the online gaming is horrible
people cheat so easily online
the season mode is pretty bad
i wish you could have multiplayer season and multiple seasons like in the old smackdowns on psits been said on here already but this mario party is much more luck based than skill based
so much of it depends on your dice block roll and other random happenings rather than how well you manage your coins and how well you earn them in the minigames
the mini games are still fun thoughmario party  may be the best mario party but that doesnt matter because it still has lame gameplay and lame graphics and sound
this is just the same old  luckbased virtual board game that all the other mario parties are
theres not much else to say except that there should be no more mario parties
i rate this game if this game worked properly i would be more than happy to give this game  stars
unfortunately the game still has several severe bugs that make it all but unplayeable
the problems are entirely due to the mission scripting not the actual game engine
and several months after releasing this game a patch for these problems has still not been released
im very very dissapointed that activision did not allow infinity ward to release a patch for these very serious problems
i would strongly recommend that people do not waste their money on this gameyou know i really like turnbased strategy tbs games
i really get into the tactics of holding territory using lines of sight and planning out my offensives in painstaking detail
maybe thats why i hate this game so much
shattered union really does do an amazing job of taking all the worst parts of the tbs genre buttugly graphics reminiscent of an early psone game rageinducing menudriven controls and unnecessarily complex rule structures and combining them into a giant pile of halfassed gameplay
what completely destroys any remaining worth that this title might hold for me though is the ridiculously large emphasis on scouting
how am i supposed to annihilate enemy troops and conquer a nation when i can only see whats happening on about  of the area of a map
in conclusion gaming giant k games has really given their fans something to scream in agony about this timenothings worse than playing a terrible game on an unsuccessful gaming system
thats exactly what we have here
granted wwe smackdown vs raw  could have been a whole lot worse but its still nothing to cheer about
no one will remember this game in  yearsoverall i loved the setting
i wish more companies would try themes other than the standard fantasy and science fiction
if they had developed the game into a full open world rpg it could have been really fun
as is it is a mixed bag ok
for a diversion but not worth spending a lot of money oni read quite a few reviews before purchasing a gamepad
i havent used one in probably  or  years but i recently went back to a simple d space combat game i used to enjoy and remember it was much better with a good gamepad than the keys on my laptopi stayed away from the poorly rated super cheap gamepads out there and when i saw the decent reviews for this one i hoped it would be a happy mediumi cant imagine there are gamepads out there that feel cheaper than this
my biggest problem is the d pad it seems to be a  way only directional pad pressing a corner produces no movement in my game at allworse even when i simply press left or right i have to really press hard for it to take sometimes it is not nearly as responsive as it needs to begoing to put this in a drawer i guess and buy one of the  pads seems like that is overpriced for something like this thoughgallop racer is the accepted leader for horse racing games but being a japanese franchise it lacks some of the authentic feel of american thoroughbred racing eg
the whole amusement park setting a lackluster wagering system etc
i had hopes that this game would make up for those shortcomings since it was sponsored by the ntra
and while the atmosphere may be much more familiar to north american racing fans the game unfortunately falls woefully short in gameplay and lasting appealthe two primary downfalls are the games simplicity and redundancy
simplicity in that there is no challenge at all either in single races where any mudder can beat an alltime great or in the stable mode where within only a few weeks youll be flush with winnings and able to breed the finest horses available
simplicity also in the races themselves  there is very little player interaction beyond some timed button mashing
what should be the centerpiece of the experience feels more like a minigame added at the last minute
there are other frustrations with the races as well such as no variety in the camera angles no ability to look back at your competitors during the race and no replays at all after the factthe redundancy is showcased in the stable mode
what should have been the key driver for replayability instead feels like a treadmill of tasks
you simply cycle through breed train enter wager race over and over again
it feels very repetitive by the third cycleon the plus side wagering is realistic and robust complete with tutorials
the fact that its the most complete aspect of the game leads my cynical side to believe that the entire title is simply an advertisement to get people to the track
this suspicion is further bolstered by the fact that you cant opt out of races that your stable isnt competing in  the game wants you to handicap wager and watch each goroundall in all this title feels like a pda or psp game  something decent for killing time at the airport while on a layover
but as a console game it lacks enough that anyone would hardpressed to spend much time in front of it given the other optionsthe quality is good considering how low the price is it has a good zipper and rugged padding
there is a little metal clasp in the case that scratches the psp though
it is not big enough to hold the charging cable and that is a deal killer for me i want everything i need in one small casethe old saying  you get what you pay for applies here for this item
its inexpensive but the quality of materials and workmanship to me is substandard
as has been noted by several other reviewers the poorly designed hook and strap is secured with an aluminum rivet that is exposed on the inside of the case see photos exactly where the back of my psp battery case touches and rubs on it  not good but this problem can easily be remediedthe strap for the small aluminum hook and the belt loop strap and very cheaply made out of rubber
i foresee these two items if i use them much at all tearing off in no time
the velcro strap that holds the middle cover over my psp has again a poorly designed velcro holder
the velcro on the strap is fine
the problem is that the velcro that secures the latch is way too small to hold the strap and again this is easily remedied with some extra stickon velcroyes my psp  fits snug but not so tight that it would concern me
the extra storage inside is pretty good  enough room for a couple umdsoverall this case is ok  but i had to fiddle with it some to make it better and safer
to me because of the cheapness of materials and construction this item should be selling for half the price  it is a functional basic case and it works but be aware that it is also cheaply madegreat deal for the price only issue is the button for the clip it can scratch the psp but i put and eye class cleaner to help protect it the clip it comes with is cheap and not durable at all it feels like its made from plastic but it does the job its supposed to maybe im just nit pickytales of symphonia was by far the best in the franchise at its time
sadly tales of legendia is an unexpected dissapointment to the series that will be remembered by the time spent playing it and wishing otherwiselegendia has no saving grace with its story plot which seemed to get sappier and stretched too thin before reaching the finale
the character development is awkard in approach as the majority of the casts focus takes place after the initial games plot which is after shortly arriving to the halfway mark
the combat system takes a step back from its freeroaming predecisor for a d plane with poor enemy design and some minor issues that will leave as much to be desired as trying to make use of the main characters grapple movea fair rental for the rpg enthusiest or casual lot but unless found in a orless bargain bin your hardearned money is better spent elsewhere
if anything skip this one and go for tales of the abysslegendia is certainly not a aaa title as it seems to define the word genericgraphics  the graphics arent bad and use the sd model which makes them look like the old tales characters
the backgrounds are bright and the charcter drawings are decent
no widescreen no prog scansound  the voice acting is reasnoble although some characters seem forced and celia in particular has the typical highpitched voice so favoured when voicing the typically weak damsel in distress
there is also an echo when characters talk as it seemed to be recorded badly
overall music is ok but nothing memorablegameplay  the game consists of wandering around a world map and going from one location to the next with some collecting of items and incidental dialogue
the battles are on a d plane much like an old fighting game they are decent if limited but never dull
the enemy variety is not great though as you will see the same enemies over and over agains for long sectons
there are a decent number of sidequests to complete so it does have some longevity
however nothing really stands outoverall  not really bad but lacking any real spark of creativity this is light years away from ff dq shadow hearts etci dont like rpgs where you only control one character in the party and the computer controls everyone else
i want to be able to control every action thats how i prefer to play rpgs
therefore i did not like this game despite the good setting though the story was generic the  hours i played through
im sure other reviews cover the positives but this negative was enough that i stopped after constantly replaying content because the ai was another hostile enemy
this may give the impression the game is hard but it isnt
i could see how to beat every battle if only the ai would cooperate
it would not combo with me and it would not heal me
i was not interested in repeatedly grinding so my main character could oneshot everything not with that combat system
ymmvi snapped this title up as quickly as possible having loved tales of symphonia to death
i was extremely excited to play as it seemed to have all of toss gameplay mechanics with a new story and characterswell call me disappointed to say the least
sure all the ingredients are here for a great rpg but the chef has left the building
toss unique charming characters and dialogue have been replaced by bland sterotypes and endless conversations that i could have predicted after the first sentence
heres a hint namco gamers like to play as people that they actually like
theres nothing fun about having as a party a perpetually angry teen who looks like a mutant his nauseatingly sweet sister a bland older man who could be everyone elses babysitter a whiny female knight a cowboy with a stupid accentthe list goes on and ongameplay is similar to tos but its dumbeddown and feels like an endless pattern of go here talk to some people run around these corridors get into a battle mash the buttons to win repeat and the random encounters were irritatingi would have liked to see my enemies before battlingoverall it seemed that namco wanted to duplicate its previous rpg success but failed to add that extra kick and charm
in a previous review an enamored me called namco the next squaresoft
i guess this is only true when they develop for the gamecubetheres absolutely nothing that compelled me to get a micro
the gba screen was already tiny enough but this has like half the screen realestate
so what if it looks better in a certain way
id have to see it firstif you want to play gba games get an sp its portable has the backlight and screen is quite biggerthe game boy micro may have the best screen any game boy has ever had and the system itself may be the perfect size for people on the go but nintendo made one cardinal error with the design and release of the game boy micro  the game boy micro is incompatible with classic game boygame boy color games
to me a game boy which is incompatible with classic game boygame boy color games is no game boy
instead i would go with the game boy advance sp because you get a backlit screen which the game boy micro offers as well as well as compatibility with all classic game boygame boy color games which the game boy micro does not offer
because of its incompatibility with classic game boygame boy color games i cannot recommend the game boy microsadly to say this device is noting more than filler whilst nintendo goes about making another gameboy which will be launched come christmas  they have simply run out of ideas to come up with for the original gameboy but they obviously havent lost thier spark when it comes to the gameboy ds
if you really want yet another gameboy that seems rather fit to being lost and crushed in your jeans pocket then go ahead and spend you  dollars on this well built yet very unrealistic gameing devicebut please do not think that i am saying it is a bad quality system quite the contrary from what ive seen and even played on it it is quite capable of keeping its own with your wallet and keys
it is very light and the screen shows all two inches in brilliant quality
quite frankly this device was dreamt up in my opinion for the  year old crowd so they can get thier hands on something that wont be too heavy for them to hold
but being an electronic device it is not meant for them so i must give a half hearted grade of  out of  stars due to as aforementioned very unrealistically made in stature and in playabilityi replaced this keyboard with the newer g orange and found it was much better all around
this g was so large that the mouse pad was scrunched in the corner also had technical problems with it after some use certain keys stopped working randomly
not sure if it was a driver issue or something else using vista but couldnt fix it
if looking for a great gaming keyboard go with the newer g insteadi purchased this keyboard well over a year ago and im already on my second one
the first was replaced by logitech because of faulty clearcoat on the paint which came off within  month of acquiring this keyboard
the replacement came soon after and the keyboard paint seemed to last for a time however  months later the frequent keys wasd to name  are already blue smudges which occured under normal use
this computer is used primarily for games and i only have a couple hours to play them a day at most ive had keyboard that have lasted for years that still look new however the same does not hold true for the logitech gdont get me wrong its a pretty keyboard with keys that are easy to press and quiet
the lcd looks sharp but is nearly uselessthis is one of the worst gaming keyboards i have owned
the keys feel mushy on press and sometimes even get stuck in the keywell which itself feels deeper than other keyboards out there
when connected to via usb the keyboard sometimes doesnt turn back on when coming out of sleep mode i rmaed it to logitechwho to be fair have great support and the new one had the same issue when no other keyboard had this problem
lastly the thing is a behemoth not only because of the extra marco keys on the left but because of the poor layout of key placement which sets everything far apart
if you are looking for a great gaming keyboard go with the tt esports or the razer blackwidow both of which are fantastic
or better yet go with a filco or dasbrought mine when it just came out so maybe theyve tweaked it by now but the light letters on dark keys just dont work well during the day
theyre light blue against black and the contrast just wasnt good enough
at night or in a dark room visibility is a lot betterthe room where i keep my pc has a lot of natural light during the days so ive since switched to the saitek eclipse keyboard blue against silver keys which i can comfortably use night and day
the saitek doesnt have all the features of the logitech so if logitech comes out with a g with silver keys i would probably switch backthe games are released as is and for an as is product you should beable to get it as freeware or the amaturish remake
even the dos box emulator that comes with it cannot be opened without a file which you must risk downloading from a third party site rar files do not open by themselves you know
like vivandi microsoft is too chincy to develope internal download programs for this jobas easily as they could
vivaldi compounds this afrustration by not even putting the install program in for the job
you cannot run these games with out the emulator and you cannot use the emulator as it is unopened and zipped up thighter than paris hiltons jeansfour stars for fun of confounding waste of time trying to config it without getting a virus  two for crapola quality of compatiblitiy and it requires xp despite not being able to work in it
also kings quest  does not include the enhanced windows version which has the better grapics in portraits and animaetoins
who works for vivandai againthis would be fun game but i cant seem to play it on the current format of my computer i will ask how but you have no help line the game does correctly all the things that a diehard  fan would care about
the presentation as far as the camera angles multipaned tricks and ridiculousyetentertaining twists and turns are all here in full force
the cast  with the surprising exception of kiefer sutherland who sounds like he rolled out of bed for his role  delivers a convincing performance
finally writer duppy demetrius does a decent job at sort of tying seasons  and  togethermeanwhile those who want a serviceable action game get something quite disappointing
the targeting system is actually quite fun allowing you to lockon after which you can pinpoint a specific body part to fire upon
however the enemies are morons to the point where youre simply ducking in and out of cover and pulling off headshots without any difficulty
to wit killswitch veterans would likely rather be playing that game instead of this
the framerate dips in these sections too making the visual experience during combat jarring and uncomfortablethe car chase scenes also suffer from noticeable framerate issues in addition to overly wonky physics
for instance if im in a sedan about to ram headlong into a bunch of suvs why  after contact  am i then able to put my foot on the gas and slowly bulldoze my way through them
furthermore the turning radius on any given vehicle is too unwieldy to drive appropriately
even if youre attuned to grand theft autos mechanics youll have a little trouble here
yes i know  characters spend a lot of time on the road but the driving issues make these sections of the game almost intolerablefinally the multiple minigames used for defusing a bomb or hacking a terminal are good pace keepers but arent at all compelling
interrogation is possibly the most intense minigame youll encounter and still it devolves into an oldschool nba live free throw hit the button when the meter is at this level affair
at least its entertaining to hear jack bauer shout even if his voice actor isnt at his best the game manages to be tolerable on the merits of its presentation and fan service and for that alone i played this game to completion and have not given it away
however as a diehard fan of the show and a diehard fan of videogames i also wanted to see this game designed properly its annoyances are too numerous to make this game more fun to play than it is to watchthe graphics and story are fantastic but the driving sequences are absolutely horrible and the controls overall are just bad
every vehicle in this game drives like a seven horsepower go carteven more annoying in my opinion is the constant character switching
jack bauer is the coolest character the character that i most enjoyed playing but so far ive only spent  of the time in his shoes
too much of the time is spent acting out the adventures of peripheral characters that arent very excitingat this point im giving it up without finishing because its not worth it
im very dissappointedon paper the idea of a  video game sounds like a great idea and upon first glance of it it seems like its firing on all cylinders
featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles kiefer sutherland dennis haysbert elisa cuthbert etc
and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show  the game falls apart once you get further into it
the missions are repetitive the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched and the controls are unresponsive to say the least
targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you
some of this could be forgiveable but the further you get through  the more rushed the game feels
its a shame too considering how innovative the series was in its early life and everything the game had going for it
if more polish was put into it  the game could have been something special but as it is its only recommended as a rental for fans of the seriesgarbagei just recently bought an xbox  and all im readind so far is how terrible the system is
about overheating and all sorts of scary reviews
 should i be scared
i hope not this system is suppose to bring good quality and good clean fun but its incredible how bad the reviews are
im really looking forward to opening this console and start playing but ill never understand why this little phenom is ocurring well if this is true microsoft should definitely do somethig cause its a rip off to the gaming world
jajaja peace outte amo mami con todo eres mi fuente de inspiracion y fortalezafirst i like to say the  has great games and love xbox live but  is not acceptable
currently on my nd unit and already started showing signs of freezing up on me again
i know ms has extended their warranty but what happens after  years and i probably play it only for about a hour a day
ive decided i will buy the ps and will stop buying anymore games for xbox unless the game i truly want is only an xbox exclusivefor everyone that keeps on complaining about the price of the ps well its now only  now
so mr gates who the fks gonna pay  for the elite when for  more you get wifi built in bluray player free online play and not to mention the ps is much more reliable then the xbox
oh the way the  gig on the elite is the biggest rip off ever
its just a way for ms to make more money off of you so you can buy and save more of their movies and tv shows
do you really need  gigs to save your gamesspend the extra  or  to buy the ps because the wifi adapter for xbox will set you back an extra 
because i dont know anybody that has their xbox right next to their modem and router unless you like running cables through your housetoo loud factnot enough good games opinionmore expensive than ps fact if you consider a hidef dvd player and wifibetter controller than ps opinionif you like to watch hi def movies the  noise will bother you
watching transformers
maybe not as much
watching planet earth
definitely annoyingopinion buy the ps and a toshiba a and you end up with both formats for less than just the  whd  wifi
and the ps game selection is very good unless you need more than  games at a time
personally i play  games and they last me a few months then add another game here or there as something cool is released
to each their own
my opinion is the ps is a superior platforma little prelude to my review
one of my neighbors is a game developer who works for a company that makes games for the xbox xbox  and msn network mostly downloadable content
he told me that his company currently has  xbox s and he warned that i should wait until all the bugs are ironed out before i buy one myselfok now onto my review
i dont understand why people would buy this system at this moment
there are no must play game for the  and thats the bottom line
also one of the reasons why you cant find one is that people are buying these things to solely to sell thus creating an entirely new class of middlemen who you can find on ebay and craigslist
this in turn makes the people who are forking over  to get this system actually believe that they are getting a great bargain when compared to what people are paying on ebaytrust me folks
just wait til spring when some more games come out or wait for the ps
you really arent missing muchi have paying twice to fix this machine that every mohts need to be fix
for the heat problem i can cook a egg with the steen coming out of the vent of this machine
and microsoft charge for the repair   for only mhonts garrantyand the sistem broke down on the  monhtfor me is not cooincidenti like the sistem but my experience is frustrade
and beside you need to buy a garranty from microsift to fix the sistem if broke down after  m aster they fix itand for me that is a rip offthat is why i not recomended this sistemhave to many problemsgot the red ring of death today after only  months of use
only solution is to send the console to microsoft for repairs
this really is unbelievablei bought an xbox on the first day with perfect dark zero
the problem is that the game would lock up after about  minutes of play
so i had to send it back to get it replaced
im still waiting for the new one
dont get this if youre buying a christmas present
you may end up with dissatisfied children on christmas day
i recommend waiting until the summer to give them time to get the kinks out of the system
also by then youll be able to comparison shop all three next generation consoles
take my word its too early to buy thisthis game will have you running errands forever and ever
this game has way to much talking in it as well
i know
i know
rpgs are supposed to have talking
but come on
this one will torcher even the biggest fan of cliched characters
worst of all the battles stink
sorry to break it to you
skip this one and move on to greener pasturesno one plays itthe novelty wears off
the fact that the movie making experience is very limited redundant and totally lacking
the stratagy part of it together with the fun and creative parts of the game is completely offputting
but its a fun game for the first  hours of playif you enjoy sim games try and get it on sale or borrow from a friend
if you dont but this game sounds intreging then think twice about this purchasezero for the gamecube is better go for that and forget this unless you like call of duty then you should get itresident evil  what a weird game
i had to try it again after my first disappointment because its rated so highly
the second time i figured this game out
i was expecting it to act more like a fps when in reality its a survival horror game
fair enough
that means instead of crouching proning jumping sprinting youll be standing totally still and shooting a bunch of zombies at close range
its a different kind of game and it is quite enjoyable until you take the negatives of re into account
the movement of your character is just so frustrating
he moves very slow
to turn around you have to use up on the analog stick  a button
thats not intuitive or fun
the instinct is to run when a zombie throws a stick of dynamite at you
but you shouldnt run because youre too slow
ironic considering our hero can run and jump out of second story buildings without a scratch
again i dont expect this to be a fps game
as a survival horror game it gets a lot right
the shooting is done very well but heres where we get to an even bigger flaw then the frustratingclumsy controls  no ammo
huh
you mean this is a shooting game where you end up using a freaking knife and he cant even move while hes swinging this knife
you got it
our hero has to get up really close to the evil zombies and swing his knife while standing still
personally i just dont find that very fun
i think the guns are a lot more fun to useso this is what happened to me  i was playing through this game like a normal gamer would by using all my handgun and shotgun ammo up
since you can only find ammo in barrels and boxes its very scarce even after you explore all the areas
thats right folks  you cant buy ammo
you can buy guns first aid hell you can even upgrade your guns firing power and reload speed with money but you cant buy ammo
what kind of a freakin game is this
you cant move with a knife in your hand and you cant buy ammo
umm ok  anyway this resulted in my inescapable death because i had to face a strong zombie with a chainsaw
the only way you can take this dude down is with a shotgun
i tried shooting him with my meager handgun ammo he lived
so then i had to use the knife but that means he quickly sawed my head off with his chainsaw
game over
to beat this jerk id have to start the game all over and start killing zombies with the stupid knife to get anywhere
but wait how do you know when its ok to use your handgun or shotgun
jokes on you gamer because  you dont
hahahahahaahahaha
here lets give the player a bunch of cool weapons and let him spend his money on them and then give him so little ammo he doesnt even know when he can use his guns
whenever he decides he can use them hell run out of ammo and have to use his knife and hell die
hahahahahahahahahahahaha
jerks
this game pisses me offthe graphics are really shiny and clearthe game stinks of too long development cycle and a derivative mindset
i was playing this game on my n years ago
sure it looks pretty but most of that is the backgrounds
half the time you spend fighting the camera while you are fighting the bad guys
major disappointmentget call of duty  or perfect dark zero for your  instead youll thank mei was so frustrated by the crappy controls on this game that i almost shut it off immediately after starting however i made it to i think level  or  my dad played it and liked it until the underwater level and then was so frustrated at trying to control the swimming character that he also gave up
this one went promptly back to gamestoptedious boss battles wonky camera controls button mashing combat and an annoying guide book make this game a must miss
kameo was slated for the original xbox and it shows the gameplay is stale and doesnt hold up
by time you hit the under water levels youll find yourself fighting the controls and the camera more than anything elsefor fans of alias
this is one hell of a mediocre game
its one of those games where you can get shot literally hundreds of times and not die uses infinite health over a health pack system for dummies gives you arrows on where to go if you get lost
the graphics and style are cartoonish so bad there are windows media player visualizations in some parts
the music is lame
the story is lame
i have no emotional investment in the characters and dont care where the story is going
ai is basic in which many enemies stand out in the open waiting to be shot
weapons are very basic other items lame there is a dooropening scrambling device  could never figure the thing out
i dont see anything ingenuitive or original in the game whatsoever except that its an fps with a female lead  so what  if you disagree prove me wrong
and once again as with many nextgen titles it uses grab cover
not much positive to say about the thing
the hard case for the le was very nicei dont give it a  because there are far worse things out there
but i cannot for the life of me understand why this is a franchise
not really impressed by its production company either rare
maybe this nextgen release is an upgrade visually from its predecessor in the franchise but even compared to lastgen games like halo halflife or doom produced years ago it just doesnt measure up
it might make for a basic introduction into an fps for a very young person that has never played one beforethere are simply far better fps nextgen and lastgen titles out there for the i know this game is old i picked it up at launch
but after seeing it under the recommended for you category on amazon i felt compelled to warn others to not buy this gameas a person who loved perfect dark  i was thoroughly underwhelmed by this game
i cannot describe what a totally different game it is
im not sure if rare lost their talent but man it is different and not in a good way
this game has frustratingly poor level design its laughable
its so bad that if you dont move for five seconds arrows light up on the ground to send you in the right direction
that should not be necessary
the plot is pretty cliched its not helped that its a prequel but it is thoroughly predictable particularly towards the end
of course carringtonn makes an appearance with a thick scottish accent not present in perfect dark  in any form whatsoveronline play is extremely mediocre tooavoid this game
its not worth its amazing to read reviews from  saying how this game has great graphics its  now and this game looks so simplistic and outdated
hard to enjoy playing a shooter game with such outdated graphics when there are games like bioshock and gears of war this game looks like a ps game in comparisonthis is a mostly dumb game
if you can find it in a bargain bin then it may be worth the investment
i like first person shooters and was looking forward to this one
however i found it to be rather lame
the graphics are only soso
voice acting is terrible
you can only hold at most three weapons at one timesome of the levels are actually much better than others so it isnt all bad
also it is fun to play deathmatch
however i have only been able to get four levels on deathmatchyou can play with  bots which is fun
also there are some hovercraft thingees that are neat and dont run out of ammoall in all i am glad that the games on the  have improved
if this was my first game i would probably trade in my  for something else
i would suggest playing other games first and wait for this title to go down further in pricewhat id pay  or lessgoldeneye is the single best gameing experience i have ever had and knowing that this is from the same people that brought me that wonderful game just makes me very sad
this whole game feels rushed and unfinished and considering how long it was in development for is quite frankly not on
the single player game is very boring youll find yourself falling asleep by the third level
the ai is appaling and to add insult to injury they for some reason felt the need to put arrows on the ground to help you on your quest
i find it insulting to think that rare feel that gamers can be so dum that they need arrows to tell them where to go someone at rare needs a slap
another thing that annoys me is that you cant jump for some reason i mean you could even jump in the original doom
quite frankly rare need a good hard kick up the arse
apart from the fairly good multiplayer game there isnt anything else good i have to say about this dissapointing mess
do yourself a favour avoid the rubbish and buy call of dutyeverything that could have been done wrong with a new fps that would have the outstanding potential of an xbox  at its arsenal was done wrongoriginally i had a feeling that this game would ressurect the tired old fps industry for console gamers
the developers had more than enough time to come up with a gripping plot line and at the same time exploit innovative in game dynamics that keep you wondering what waits for you around the cornerthis game had me wondering why in the hell am i shooting at a bunch of stupid robot spiders
at the very beginning but i decided to have faith in the game and what would come if i dealt with this obscenely tedious first levelin this game if you shoot someone square in the forehead they buckle in place for a split second and then resume their tactics as if a bullet had not just ripped through their skull
shoot them in the neck you see a spray of blood and they die so at least the developers know something about the human anatomy
whether a bullet bounces off of body armor or tears through flesh your enemies will still react with the same booty dance of painthe game shows how little the developers cared that they were making a game for the xbox  as it looks like it could easily have been on the n
the game graphically is a short step above turok   the enemies will run to a position where they can cover and shoot you with the same basic run motion it looks as if theyre running with moon bootsthe game throws you stupid little missions where youre held in a pretty tiny area
not for lack of modern day video game technology but for lack of the creativity needed to design a level in a first person shooter that rivals a level from wolfenstein dwhat is supposed to set this game apart from games like shadow warrior or doom  is the fact that all around you is an ongoing in depth plot
the plot for this game is that youre chasing a bad guy and thats about itthe big bad guy from this game is difficult to spot mainly because he isnt given any kind of real introduction and he looks like a moronall in all this game punished me for ever investing money in rare and i am eternally sorry for thinking that microsoft gave a damn about a gamers right to have fundo not invest money into rare microsoft deserves a second chance i guess
when the playstation  comes out my  is going right in the trashfor fans of alias
this is one hell of a mediocre game
its one of those games where you can get shot literally hundreds of times and not die for dummies gives you arrows on where to go if you get lost
the graphics and style are a bit cartoonish there are windows media player visualizations in some parts
the music is lame
the story is lame
i have no emotional investment in the characters and dont care where the story is going
ai is basic
weapons are very basic other items lame there is a dooropening scrambling device  could never figure the thing out
i dont see anything ingenuitive or original in the game whatsoever
and once again as in many nextgen titles it uses grab cover
not much positive to say about the thing
the hard case for the le was very nicei dont give it a  because there are far worse things out there
but i cannot for the life of me understand why this is a franchise
not really impressed by its production company either rare
maybe this nextgen release is an upgrade visually from its predecessor in the franchise but even compared to lastgen games like halo halflife or doom produced years ago it just doesnt measure up
it might make for a basic introduction into an fps for a very young person that has never played one beforei have to say right of the bat that this does not seem like a next generation game the graphics are incredibly bland and blocky the game is buggy and the story is just plain boring and nonsensical
now that being said the game is very much playable and the bugs do not cripple it but overall the game is just one big snoozefest
had the game come out on ps or xbox years ago it would have been an average game but i expect a little more in games nowadays and this game is just not very polished and honestly just not that much fun
i played through this once and maybe somewhere down the road ill give it another shot but for now one play to the end is all i can endurei bought this for the added bots in multiplayer despite the gameplay itself being old school no jumping
lol but nowadays every fps comes with a multiplayer with added bots option which makes this game obsolete
i havent played it since after i got it as there are much better games out there now
dont get me wrong its a great game for its time but it just cant stand up to them as its basically outdatedgraphics   out of fun  out of game  boringi bought this game because i had heard the hype about it that it was supposed to be all next gen and the new halo but it was definatly not do not but this game get call of duty insteadwell i got my x box  fully loaded on the day one launch night  i love it 
i got pgr  and call of duty   which are awesomei saw this game being  displayed at my gamespot  and i played it  i was like wtf
this is a wanna be haloi did not buy this  thoughi rented it  im glad i did not get this title first of all the graphics are good and all thats a givenbut  the controles are slugglish and not fluidit sometimes freezes up in gameplay  or goes in slow motion which sucksjust like the matrix i suggest you rent this game or buy it used down the road the nintendo  game perfect dark played better  however this is the vamped up version of that title  but it still looks too cartoonish for my taste
i want realism in a shooter like the afore mentioned halo seriessmilesand  where is halo  you mught ask
well all good things take time its on the way i already got my copy pre ordered    master chief would pimp slap joanna darkwithout ever breaking a sweat 
nuff saidkudos to microsoft on a great next gen system
it was well  worth the wait  well until the playstation  comes out in the spring that is  then the real fun beginsodd physics clunky racing random drifting hitwallspinoutlosethreeplacelastlap style races crappy car selection overall i played the game for about  minutes before i got bored and frustrated
remember need for speed underground
drifting was great there and well executed however unrealistic as it was
forza just took drifting out all together and made the rest of the game flawless
pgr tried to do both with allowing you to pull off moves but did it poorly
you either break hard not at all early causing you to understeer into a wall or late causing you to slide careening into a wall
slow acceleration of any of the cars in the game makes it pretty boring
like i said about  minutes worth of gametime before you put it down for goodthe game stands out for its improved graphics i must say
however this particular game isnt the winning racer for me
the variety of luxurious cars was pretty good however it was the game play that really bombed
the hits cars take from each other was a little bit too weak and unrealistic
when a car bumps into another it wipes out very quickly which seems unrealistic again unless someone can verify that realism by driving over  mph on the streetsi wasnt impressed much the online game play against other races wasnt too bad and might be worth added to how the graphics are to score some pointers for the game but it just wasnt all that
one thing that would be great is if the cars were customizable
but in this game what car you buy is what you get nothing to customize
even a grand turismo best racing simulator in my opinion you can customize some aspects of the car but not in pgr this game wasnt a seller so i traded it back to get need for speed most wanted which i must say would be much more my type of racing game
overall not that impressive of a racing game unless you just want to watch the stock cars racing on your tv insteadthe game simply didnt impress me
on my previous xbox i owned pgr and pgr and when i got my xbox  i bought pgr
by far pgr and pgr are the best
project gotham racing  just failed in terms of graphics and concept and if you ask me the graphics for pgr are just as great as the graphics for pgr and generally that would be good but considering pgr came out in  it is not a compliment
the game just isnt goodjust an empty shell of a game
i am dumbfounded how they could have ruined it from pgr
online cat  mouse is useless and the last man standing just doesnt cut it
all the cars drive the same the graphics are hard to see the road from the deep shadows its just a messthis game is so hard it takes away any fun
its like people play games for recreation to have fun and relax not to be stressed out because the game is so hard its just like work instead of play
and also another thing that is bothersome in this game is that it is filled with long loading screensmy  came with its own  gig hard drive
i got the premium bundle and saved money in the long run
however due to the small capacity of the original drive you will end up purchasing this item sooner or later
that is if you want to keep any of your contentyes the specifications are a bit deceiving
the  comes with a  gig drive but it arrives almost halfway full of preloaded content
basically you will be lucky to have  gig of space after you install the update
how long will it take you to fill up that space
well that really depends on what you download
the content that you load will determine whether you will decide to delete them to free up space or whether you will want to keep them and just buy this additional drivehow about movies
well in citans opinion there really is no reason to keep these movies in your hd after their expiration
since you can no longer play them you may as well delete them and free up space
demos trailer music etc
you may want to keep those
and this is where you will run out of roomthe replacement drive is overpriced
and undersized
but due to the consoles design you will not be able to substitute just any serial hard drive
this is the only replacement available
no one can ever say that microsoft doesnt know how to get the most money out of its customers
they didnt get to where they are by being otherwisewhether i give this drive my recommendation or not is irrelevant at this point
this is your only choice should you run out of space in the original drive
microsoft will eventually release a larger drive
that is pretty much a given
i can only hope that it will work with the current console and not just the version  that is currently in the works
if you can wait for the new drivesimply put i owned this  gig hard drive for almost a year before microsoft released the  gig recently
it was not big enough to hold my savegames downloadable map packs xbox live arcade games tv shows etc from the very beginning
i was constantly deleting stuff to make room for other stuff and then if i wanted to watch something i had deleted i had to go find it and redownload it which meant i had to delete something else and its a very slow process
i recently bought the  gig and although its overpriced as is this one i have been unable to fill it up
additionally it seems slightly faster although i havent measured how fast trust me when i say that buying this hard drive would be a mistake unless you never plan on downloading movies tvshows it isnt even big enough to hold an entire season of any one show anything in hd add on packs for your games etc
and part of the functionality of having an xbox  is being able to do this things so either buy the elite or buy the  gb hdd you will be glad you saved yourself the hassle of memory managementwell the reason im giving this hard drive  stars is because
these should come on all the xbox  systems not just on the platinumsome not everyone is rich and everyone wants to get their child what they want you cant even play old xbox games without this thingthe hard drive is pretty much pointless unless you connect your computer to it if you dont then all it is is a  gig memory card and it allows you to play old xbox games which is a plus but i bought the  to play  games which arent too amazing with the exception of a few ghost recon  saints row condemned and a few othersyou cant buy these in stores as most of them get limited amounts of these things about  per storei bought this hard drive excited to be able to create my own soundtracks using my ipod nano but was ultimately dissappointed when it told me that it could not transfer any files to the hard drive so my question is how do you make your own soundtracks if you dont have the latest computersoftware
you cantin summary you pretty much need to be rich and living in a hollywood condo to enjoy the full capabilities of the xbox  which are vastwith the cost of the xbox live headset the wireless connecting router and the xbox live fees its really a shame that these things arent accessible to everybody
i bought  core package which is the poormans version and i feel like i should have gotten more for my  let alone pay for  a game
this stuff is getting way too expensive i remember when games were  at the most
but i will say that the  is a way better buy then the highly overpriced ps which wont last too much longer due to poor promotionpriceand low availability of games
sony screwed up  and  doesnt look too good either
i had a psp for about  months after i got it and i traded it in for store credit because there arent any good games for it and then they want you to buy a memory cardsuch a small hard drive
i only use it for back up or travel if im going somewhere to visit family and have some games on it
otherwise dont botherthe silver finish is pretty tacky
ive had dozens of faceplates over the years i worked at xbox and this is the only miserably bad one ive owned
i recommend passingits a memory unit so you can store game saves your xbox live account information and any content downloaded through xbox live thats locked to a particular account
thats all it does
you cant connect this memory card to your computer to use it as an extra storage option either such as moving music and photos from the computer to view through the xbox  it only connects to the xbox  periodthe nintendo wii and sony playstation  allow you to use almost any sort of usbbased storage device such as external hard drives or sd card to save and store content game saves inclusive
given the level of storage flexibility in the other two consoles this product simply costs too much money for the extremely limited onetaskonly functionality provided
the same problems plaguing this unit infect the other xbox  storage options including the overpriced completely proprietary nonstandard hard drivesyou can buy a multigigabyte thumbdrive for the price of this one  mb card but you cant use that thumbdrive to save your xbox live account and xbox  game saves
you can use that thumbdrive to view pictures and listen to music on your xbox  though
why the disconnect
why not use usb for game saves and the like
theres something wrong with that sort of business modeltwo stars for lack of compatibility no multitasking uses over reliance on proprietary methods and lack of support for accepted storage mediums and standardsi have a really large living room with my sofa on one side and all my electronics on the other   feet away
so whenever i play my xbox or gamecube i have to be connected with an extension cord  one for the xbox two for the gamecube
when i considered every wireless option for the two systems none ever met with my criteria ie
controller comfort fast responsiveness and the option of having a rumble featureneedless to say i was more than a little excited at the prospect of the xbox  being available with wireless rumble enabled controllers with the same basic layout and feel of their old scontrollers and the option of rechargeable batteries to boot
with bluetooth even
and the play  charge kit made the concept even sweeter
until i got the kit homey see i thought this thing was gonna be able to plug into a wall socket while i played and since i happen to have such a socket conveniently placed behind my couch this was pretty perfect
i also assumed that  like my nintendo ds or my ipod  i would be able to charge the thing while i was asleep as wellfirst of all there is no mention whatsoever that you have to plug the thing into your xb in order for it to work on the packaging
none
its as if microsoft was afraid that that might make people think hmm doesnt that suddenly make my bluetooth controller wired
bad microsoft very bad
and while the packaging is one of those blister packs the usb connector is hidden behind the cardboard backing
totally uncool
because i decided to display my game console on its own dias on the other side of the room away from any other heat sources the  foot length of the cord is pretty pointless for me
the fact that the console has to be on to charge the battery is simply fallacy
its just a bad execution all aroundi recommend picking up the xb quick charge kit when it becomes available
its supposed to be pretty much an old fashioned battery charger that you just plug into a wall and let sit
the battery is fully charged in  hours whether youre asleep or not and you dont need your xb on to do it
sure this may mean having to pick up an extra battery or two to make sure your gaming is uninterrupted but so what
youd really have to do that with this contraption anywaythis battery dies a lot quicker then my rechargeable
i got it because i could still use my good controller even when the batteries were dead because of the chord but its annoying that im a casual gamer who plays at the most  hrs a day and the battery dies every day
at one point it is useful but at another point wtf
oobasically you plug one end into your xbox  system and the larger part into your wireless controller
once you turn your system on this item is suppose to charge the battery pack of your controller for an endless amount of timesfirst and foremost this item defeats the purpose of having a wireless controller since it needs to be plugged into your system just like a normal remotesecondly and most frustratingly the part that plugs into your controller is very fragile
if you plug  unplug it from the remote only a few times the plug can actually begin to wear down and not charge properly and even go as far as to not charge at all
this has happened to me  times total
after the rd time i gave up on this product completelyfinally this item is suppose to tell you how charged up your battery is on the xbox  dashboard
half the time it does not do thatdont waste your money with this thing
just go and buy yourself a recharger with rechargeable batteries such as thesony quick battery charger with  aa nimh rechargeable batteriesand youll be good
sure this product is cheap but after a few times you will wish you had taken my adviceive had  of these official batteries and it seems like they dont last more than  months before they crap out i dont even abuse them in any way im a light gamer
the last battery i had lasted about  charges and i went the last month or so without going on my xbox much
when i went to plug my play and charge kit back in the light would only stay red for a few seconds and then it would turn green like it was finished charging
when unplugged the controller will not start
basically i have a wired controller now
i love when the thing actually worked but it seems to die way too quickly
save your money and just get rechargeable aa batteriesi ordered two of these for my wireless controllers
at first i loved them
they charged all the way up and lasted almost as long as aas
after like  months however they began only charging to  bars and ran out very quickly
i prefer using regular batteries now since they last so much longer
i would not reccommend thesethis was good for when i first bought my xbox  and it charged fast and even while i was playing so i could avoid an inconvenience
the cord is an ok
length and playing while charging is nice though the cord can be a downer
in about  or  months the problems came and the battery held no charge and no matter how long i left it plugged in it didnt matter
while i had it i found it better than buying batteries but for what i payed it doesnt seem like i got my monies worth
some people had good luck and for those i am happy but this item didnt hold its worth for meall  controller battery packs die too quickly i bought two of the pink ones because they were about  each as opposed to buying a black one which for some reason was 
the charge lasted pretty long but after about  months it wouldnt hold a charge anymore and i was back to plugging my controller in
honestly unless your tv is like ft away from you just keep your controller plugged in and screw the wireless battery packs
not worth iti dont recommend these packs for gamers
mine quit working within a month
people dont know though that you can bust open these and take the batteries out and charge them in a normal battery charger
i recommend buying the rechargeable batteries and doing it that wayi purchased this for my sons xbox controller i bought a pink one so that no one would steal it as there are other xboxs and controllers in my house and it does not charge it has to be plugged in in order to use it and i know it is not the charging cord because it works on other controllers and on this controller with other batteries
it just does not work with this batterybuttons are very sensitive and numbers get repeated almost constantly which makes it practically useless as a remote for my tvthis is a nice deluxe remote  for the its backlit  but thats about itnothing really new hereif you were lucky to get a  fully loaded versionyou have the limited edition remote that came with it  trust me  its all that you needand half of the buttons you dont even need to use  mostly just for the dvd functionsmy daugher loves the mic
she like to talk to people on xbox live
her mic is about to broke
this mic doesnt last for a year
you should get a wireless mici have had my xbox  for over  years and like most people i have back ground noise in my house that is undesirable to the rest of the world barking dog barking wife and kids etc
the older version of the headset had the mute switch located on your hand controller and could be switched with no effort at all  seriously simpler than hitting the x button
anyway now microsoft fixes the previous headset and locates the mute switch some  from the controller somewhere near my adams apple or whatever  not sure the brilliance with this or how this was supposed to help the gaming experience guess i am not as smart as the richest man in the world
anyhow so with the unit i now leave my mike muted all the time as i dont have time in most games to hunt for the switch dangling from my earpiece
this is my same issue the the wireless headsets but save that for another review
enjoypeople dont hear you well lots of noise uncomfortable moves around while gaming short cord cheap feel
why would they make such a producti thought id get a set of headphones for our xbox when they arrived  only then did they say that theseheadphones are of no use unless you are playing thegame online and want to talk to other playersi tossed them in the trashuntil it doesnt work
it came with my  that i bought about  or  months ago
it was okay it did its job until the thing just finally gave out
wouldnt recommend buying onei bought the  that comes with the headset
i never really used it until after a couple weeks when i got xbox liveive had xbox live since late june and i am writing a review in early augustso my headset only lasted  monthsthe  and other microsoft products work fine but this is troublethe problem with mine is when i plugged it in which i had played earlier this morning and i sent a message to one of my friends and i couldnt hear them and we did some figuring and i later found out when i tap the end of my cord it cuts the soundand now it doesnt workif i were you i would buy a different  headsetamazon shipped me this controller perfectly
it was a perfectly brand new controller and it works perfectly
i got no complaints about the transactionthe designers of this controller need to figure out how to do better with the next generation
it is too smoothe and not the right shape for my hands to get a good grip anywhere on it
my hands slide all around the edges
i play mass effect which requires you to hold down the r bumper for extended periods of time while also pushing other buttons
i find this a very difficult move to do because this controller offers no leverage when pushing the r bumper
there is just this slippery toowide cone shaped thing that slides right through the palm of your hand unless you do like a clawgrip which becomes very tiresome after awhilebooo to microsoft for not doing some qa on this controller but rushing it out the door in a simplified and sleek aerodynamic look to sell product
i dont care what it looks like make it serve the needs of the people who are going to be spending hours per day with the productthere are a bunch of things the  lacks and built in wireless internet is one of them
you have to add on  for wireless internet
it works well when you get it set up but adding on things to get the  adds upthe hd dvd player and the wireless internet add up to  bucks
thats  over the psoverall if you have wireless internet this is a requirement for online gaming and its another way microsoft robs you of your cashthis is an excellent wireless adapter for xbox live gameplay works flawlessly
the big problem is it should be with the xbox  when you buy it not having to pay  dollars later on to get it to play xbox live
the microsoft rapeage is getting a little rediculousfirst of all i want to point out that ive used multiple devices to try and get a good connection between my wpn netgear router and my xbox logitech play link  works perfectly easiest to set up online gaming is flawless but downloads were wayyy too slow hours and hours to downloadnetgear hdx powerline adapters  didnt work at all absolutely terrible performance barely worked in the same roomxbox  wireless adapter  the main reason for this review it is the nicest looking of the ones i usedtook up the least amount of space
however i got it to stream hd off of my laptop
even when the two were in the same room in clear view of the router i never could get more than  out of  bars for the media center performance test
i was frequenstly disconnected for no reasons yeah it worked but didnt do what i bought it formy solution
the belkin wireless range extender fd
i picked it up used on craigslist for  dollars shippedthe setup was not the easiest gotta follow the instruction in some amazon reviews if you use wep security but once it is set up it works amazinga
it extends your wireless so now my router is on the other side of our  sq
ft house and on the first floor this extender is on the rd floor in my room extending the internet to my laptopb
you can hardwire anything xbox  via ethernet into its lan port making the connection to my laptop securely in the acceptable range for streaming hd
now the xbox is hardwired i have increased my wireless rnage significantly and i paid  dollarspoint being skip the microsoft wireless adapter pick up the belkin extender does more costs wayyyyyy less worksi bought this adapter about four months ago and at first it worked pretty well but after buying a nseries router for my wireless home computer network the adapter wouldnt connect at all after trying various ways i finally found out that this would only not recognize the router but wouldnt accept the higher wpa security as well even though it was on the menu selection screen
after contacting microsoft and hearing what probably a few other hundred people have have heard that theyre going to release a newer version that would accept the network i thought hey thats great can i send this and get the newer version since i just bought this adapter but not only are they not giving out a release date of this supposed newer version bought you have to repurchase the damn thing
im sorry but after paying  for this and hearing that it really pisses me off so now im just using an ethernet cable plugged to my computer and going that way
so if you have a lower router adapter than the nseries than fine this is a pretty good adapter and links up easily but if youre like thousands of others and have upgraded to the nseries router than pass this horrible headache of an item overmicrosoft admits this will not work with wpait rarely works with wpa cannot even see my routers ssidanything less than that wep or no encryption is absurdly risky unless there is no other traffic on your router
do not disable your encryption to play games kids
its not worth itmom and dad if your kid is using this device they have probably compromised your wireless network securityany game that relies heavily on saving and replaying until you dont die in that last  seconds is weak and needed more game play testing time
doom  was fun this follow up game is not worth your time and should never have made it out the door
im annoyed i bought it used for  thats how bad it islets start with the a positive note the background graphics are gorgeously done which remind me of the myst game series
i think the game would come across even better if they made it first person instead of the awful third person graphics they laid on top of the background graphics
the characters bodyergonomic movements remind me of second generation nintendo graphics  awfulthen there is the voice actingscripting  just terrible sooo unnatural you can almost hear the pages in the actors hands being switched  and did they hire people off the street to do the painfully fake european accents voiceovers on here
there are even parts where you can hear they used different people for the voiceover scripting in the same paragraphs or sentencessome of the logic behind things you have to do is moronic
i dont know if they are intended to be comedic or its just more cheese
for example having to tie a stick of dynamite to a rat to let him go through a hole in a wall to blast a secret door openim sure we all think of things like that to do in our problemsolving skills
with the over all serious tone of the game from the beginning im guessing this wasnt an attempt at humour but just plain cheese as with the voice scriptingactingi havent even finished the game but im going to since i paid for it even if it means turning the audio off because the voiceactingscript is as bearable as nail scratching a chalkboardand thats what makes this game almost scarywarning this is not a nextgen console game far from it
microsoft is busy creating patches to play old games from the original xbox on the take interactive beat them to the punch packaged the game for the  and raised the price by by no means does this showcase any sort of graphic capabilities of the  in fact it actually looks worse in high def
none of the interface graphics were developed for high def  theyre all jaggy aliased and look like they were from a sega genesisthe game plays well
the commentary is awful
wait til next year or at least buy this for an older platform and save the moneyits almost a crime to charge  for this gameafter loving oblivion morrowind baulders gate iii icewind dale iii i could not get into this game it does not have the same fun or interest factor to keep me playing
i started out thinking it was kind of cool but there so so much better in depth games out thereneverwinter nights is a disappointment and at best an average rpg
one thing i enjoy about dd games is being able to play with four or more party members whose abilities harmonize to overcome my foe
but this game only allows me to play one created character along with just one henchman
i also enjoy nonlinear games
why not let my first level character take on that ninth level monster if i choose to do so
but this game is really a linear quest in a nonlinear shell
i have played rpgs with truly memorable plots and characters but those in this game will fade into obscurity
the bosses i fought in this game are hardly worth mentioning
and that tremble of greed that runs through me as i stand over my slain foes weapon and see that it has the glint of magic is noticeably absent as i play this game
an rpg that demands as much time as this must be enjoyable
but after playing this game for a while others will also realize that neverwinter nights is more drudgery than funi really tried to like this game
i put a lot of hours into trying to like it but its not fun 
this game involves too much reading for me just get me to the quick action give me my fix i dont care about indepth plots or long lengthy dialogs anymore thats old style rpg games
i prefer the diablo everquest and world of warcraft quick fix style of play all action many players to interact with a social status element to the game loose story line free to go and roam wherever and whenever i feel like it
everquest has hundreds of players to interact with
i can choose not to fight and hang out in a pub and chit chat with other players in everquest
in neverwinter i get to hang out and chat with a bunch of npcs  boring
the multiplayer element is poor in neverwinter
it might have been really good when it was released but these days its an abandoned ship all the players have jumped off of biowares ship and stole away to either sony or blizzard
so trying to play a multiplayer neverwinter nights game these days is hopless
the items in this game cant match the item selection in those other games treasure is banal and  or  to this and that
i like big numbers even though  or  means a lot in old school dd and is equivalent to  something in diablo
the  to all atributes in diablo just has a much more mouth watering effect it makes me want to leap for joy
bigger numbers look better
bioware change the number system
a barbarian in diablo that has  strength is a lot more interesting than a warrior that has  strength in old school dd
a bigger number system just looks betterwe made a mistake when setting up my sons xbox live gold account that we paid for with this card
we noticed the problem the first day of the account and contacted xboxcom
our only recourse was to cancel this account and open a new one
if we had paid with a credit card this would have been possible but since the live card is non refundable and non transferrable this was not possible
so now we either have to live with the problems of the account or lose the money and pay for a new onethis is just mss way of confusing the dollar value of items and using base psychology to convince people that they cant just leave a couple points sitting out thereits a smart business move but a pain for the consumerthe item did exactly what it was supposed to do but i feel the product as a whole is sub par at best
thank god they switched to real money transactions and got rid of this nonsensethis game is very fun it has a coaster cam new rides good d but it wont work on even some of the most powerfull home computers wait until atari has fixed the game glitches  until then  make sure thatyou check the requirements on the box so that you know if it will work on your computer
update if your computer will not play the game try increasing your paging file
in this game i made the top thrill dragster and lots of other real coasters
this is a fun gamenormally i dont write video game reviews but since i had wanted this game so badly and it turned out to be such a disappointment here you gobeing from the very old school of gamers some of my favorite games of all time include aces of the pacific and aces over europe look em up kids
those games not only provided hours of enjoyment back in the day but also sparked my interest in the aircraft from the wwii era how do you imagine i thought up my wicked amazon name hm
since then ive enjoyed a number of flying combat games including the ace combat series for the psso when i saw that there was a new wwii flying combat game for the ps i was very excited and rushed to get a copy of heroes of the pacific
what a terrible disappointment it turned out to bethere are some positives of course
the graphics are fantastic  very good use of wwii propaganda posters fonts and other pictures help place you in the time period
you can tell a lot of effort was put into giving the cutscenes that old film look complete with scratches skips etcbut nice graphics do not a good game make and this game falls short in most other areasif youre the type of person who likes to customize their controls to suit their flying style you will be disappointed and frustrated here
you have precisely  control layouts to choose from and no matter which one you choose your left thumbstick controls your banking and diving and your right thumbstick controls your throttle and rudder
so if youre like me and you have a clumsy left thumb then youre going to be a clumsy pilot and thats that
these controls are difficult and nonintuitive especially when compared to the ace combat controlsof the  available skill levels i selected pilot second from easiest and still couldnt hack even the tutorial levels
not to say that im the best game player out there  im actually rather bad  but this was ridiculous
the mission that requires you to just recover from a stall took me half a dozen times to get through
i dont know what physics the programmers put into the game here but when you stall your plane its like the hand of god suddenly shoves you towards the earth at about  times the normal rate of speed
you literally have  seconds to get your planes nose pointed down rev your throttle and pull out of your stalli finally gave up on the training missions and their ultraannoying voice acting and decided to jump straight into the historical missions
and more trouble surfaced of courseits already been mentioned by other reviewers but you have zero freedom in this game
you get too close to your very small mission area boundary and youll find yourself getting chewed out by some faceless voice your plane is forced into a sudden roll and youre headed back into the frayand the difficulty of these missions
for example one of the very first missions requires you to go help your buddies get back to the airbase while theyre being chased by enemy planes
this is all well and good if it werent for the fact that you start the mission about  miles away from the action and no matter how fast you fly your plane toward the battle inevitably one or two of your buddies gets shot down before you even get there
and get this  you can only lose something like  pilots before you get sent right back to the beginning of the missionso you gamely wade into the fray with your clumsy left thumb piloting your plane manage to miraculously pop one or two enemies and then you crash
what
why did i crash
oh its because while i was cutting a tight circle to line up an enemy in my sights i failed to notice that my altitude was dropping rather quickly
but if i dont circle to line up the enemy then my buddies get shot down even faster
so here let me throttle back a bit this time to try and line them up and stall handofgod crash mission failed
you know what
during all the time i played this game i never once got shot down by an enemy plane
i just crashedwhat funi played this game twice for a combined total of  hours before giving up
its really no fun at all and im not surprised it never became very popular
perhaps someone younger and with quicker reflexes could do better at it
me im going back to ace combatim a newcomer to the civilization series and likely to draw ire from fanboys of the fanbase
but while i started off hating civilization for no real reason i grew to love it and become addicted to civilization iv
then that addiction fell off quicker than eight months in rehab and i came to realize just why that addiction ended so abruptlythis game is not really a game but more a pleasant little timewaster for two or three hours a week then two or three hours a month and so onmy first encounter with the civilization series was civilization iii which unfortunately i could not get over the fact that each turn ended passed some  years in which the most primitive and basest of technologies such as the wheel or fire would take  years to acquire and thus by  bc where most civilizations in reality are conquering huge landmasses conquering rudimentary plumbing and developing philosophical and scientific theories that would dominate the cultural landscape for thousands of years to come my civ civilization had just learned how to ride horses and learn how to count but not how to readit also didnt help that my city spend some  years on fire
i suppose that fire was supposed to represent unrest but considering its a fire and fire was a very huge disaster in ancient times i thought it was both highly inaccurate and highly offensivecivilization iv doesnt suffer as much from this but unfortunately it does do this system whereby the natural evolution of civilizations is not at all organic and dependent upon the location the people the religion the government etcetera but is all on a fixed line where your civilization advances at the same rate as everyone else
you can be guaranteed to research certain technologies around the exact same time period each gamegunpowder circa s  s ad that sort of thing
there is absolutely no chance of a sudden sharp advancement in civilizationunless you waste valuable resources building a certain monument first that grants you certain privilages you can expect to not be able to experience such things as democracy in an ancient athens or free speech in a medieval kingdomyou have to have certain ideals happen in certain times and there is no way and no chance of defying the rigid construct and having a revolution occur in your civilization that defies all others such as a democracy in athens or a republic in rome or carthage
as such it would be impossible to recreate such civilizations as the roman republic because rome cant be a republic in this game until some time in ad well after the republic was long dead and gone
you cant have alexander the great spreading religious tolerance in the s bc
you cant defy the median civilization setup you have to have your civilization develop on a straight and narrow linebecause of this not only is there no chance for innovation but almost all the other civilizations on the map will you will advance at the same rate and advance with the same technologies
this means that there is no chance for an encounter such as that of the imperial spanishfrenchenglish with the new world native americansin this game they would be just as heavily armored and gunpowdered as the europeans though maybe without the compass inventionanother problem is the diplomacy
to put it simply there is none
this is in no way advanced enough to come close to reality during these times save for maybe the most ancient prehistorical examplesive played half a dozen games and the diplomacy in all of them has consisted of thisnew leader meets me offers alliance
i choose allianceten turns later they offer open bordersfifty turns later they offer a heavily unbalanced trade that i rejectfive turns later they demand i cease trade with another civilization
i do so
that civilization comes back and reoffers trade
first civilization seems to completely ignore this factone civilization randomly threatens me with war for no reason
i tell them the equivalent of bring it on they never dothere is no advanced diplomacy here
there is no intelligent ai
all other civilizations ever do is offer peace then trade then try to get you to give them your researched technology for inferior ones that take less time or you already have being researched and completed in one turn or just plain dont want like communism
they sometimes threaten hostile actions against you for no reason and proceed to never follow up
they sometimes threaten you to give them a technology or else and that or else turns out to be nothing then they have the obnoxious audacity to come back to me a turn or so later demanding the exact same technology but this time with a cock and bull story of how their civilization is suffering and they need charityno civilization ever goes to war with me unless i declare first
no civilization ever asks me to mediate disputes
no civilization ever asks for trades that are not routine one corn for one rice yes
or nationalism for gunpowder and  gold yes
no civilization ever asks for military assistance or cultural exchangeeven the diplomacy in rome total war is better than this
at least the rtw factions randomly declare war on you for some reason of necessity or greedthe map interface itself is quite simple in itself but the larger your civilization gets the more cluttered it becomes
towns and farms and mines and windmills and roads all take up individual spaces making for a highly inaccurate display where cities are evenly distributed and not resemblence of reality where larger congregations of people would flock to seaside areas rather than in the middle of a desert
this is also a horrifying ordeal to handle in times of war when some random pack of enemy jerkwads come and start destroying minor towns and farms and the like
you move your city garrison out to attack them only to have another pack of enemy jerkwads have the obnoxious audacity to fly right past your units and completely destroy a city two or three squares away from youthe worst aspect is the military
i am a military historian and i love games like rome total war and medieval ii total warthere is no military aspect in this game
its all literally an arms race for getting the best unit first for a slight advantage against the randomness of a dice roll decision
its frequently common to see one enemy warrior successfully defeat three of your enemy warriors
the animation only proceeds to enrage you as one by one your warriors stand up in front of the enemy only to be beaten aside by their club or sword without ever swinging first themselvesthere is no concept of realism in military conflicts as ive once had a pair of enemy swordsmen defeat a fresh new pack of war elephants
ive had chariot riders be killed flawlessly by enemy crossbowmen
ive had mongol horse lancers defeat two units of machine gun infantry
and not the ww style machine gunners but the type who hold a machine gun in one hand and a rocket launcher in the other handhow is that supposed to be a part of a grand and pleasant game experience when your spaceage civilization has half its army destroyed by medieval horse lancers
just because they outnumber youone of the worst parts involves destruction of cities
all it takes is one enemy unit of any kind to wander into your city with no defending units and they completely destroy the city
burn the rubble clear the ashes salt the land everything goneso i lost my capital because i sent the units away to attack a pack of random barbarian archers only to have those archers somehow slip past my units from another square enter my capital and completely destroy itrepetitive singular with virtually no replayability
make sure never to go to war because it will always be a disgustingly short plodding ridiculous affair where  of gameplay is hitting end turn and waitingupdate the expansion packs completely change much of the ai and randomness experience for the better
its an immensely more playable game with themth version of my review  march while i can edit this review i cant updating the ratings above if i could then id change them to  stars for fun and  stars for overall with the  patch installedi stand by my earlier contention that k games pushed civ out the door a few months too early
civ should never have gotten through sqa software quality assurance and been declared golden ready for commercial release with these kinds of defects
i suspect this was done to increase christmas sales but the netwide flap over the civ problems likely had just the opposite effectsince then kgames had released patches to fix most of the technical problems
because of that ive deleted the section i originally had in this review regarding installation and graphics driver problems just be sure to download and install the current civ patch version  as of this updated posting from the kgamescom web site before playingthat said i am quite happy with the changes and expansions made to civ
my highest praise goes to the actual game design changes to witfaster gameplay
i typically play with a huge world but i finish a game a lot faster than i could in civ
thats not saying too much ive still had a few allnighters
reduction or elimination of a lot of the micromanagement
i am so happy not to be dealing with riots in virtually every game that ive played ive never had to open up a city and reallocate who was working where
also automated workers are a lot smarter and have more optionsthe improved terrain modeling and the increased improvements options again it makes things more interestingthe combat unit promotion track
i tend to go for nonmilitary victories but this feature may make me play around more with actually conquering my neighbors
it also makes barracks more valuablethe civics and religion aspect
both are interesting and fun and both appear to be wellbalancedthe culture borders concept
this allowed me to stake out territory while minimizing incursion by other nations
however be aware that keeping your borders closed irritates the ais after a whilethe great leaders concept
there was a little of this in civ but this new implementation makes it a far more vital part of the game
i managed to trigger two  golden ages for myself in one game one by building the taj majal the other by using several great leaders and i also kept a few great engineers on hand to hurry some major wonder projects towards the end of the game
and great artists are very useful for culture bombing neighboring cities or preemptively staking out large amounts of unclaimed territorymost of the complaints i had ui response lack of rightclick menu features raging barbarians appear to have been fixed or at least improved by the  patch
here are a few that remainthe show friendly moves option does not include units that are automaticly exploring scouts galleys etc
which is where i used it the most in civ
indeed there appears to be some overall flakiness in both the show friendly moves and show enemy moves optionsits hard to tell at times whether civ is paying any attention to those options even with the  patch installed when you complete a game its best to exit civ before starting a new game
ive had one or two abrupt crashes when ive tried to go from completing one game to starting a new oneall this said civ is a  major improvement in game design and graphics over civ
it is very addictive and ive spent far more time playing it over the past several months than i should have
brucethis game plays out like a board game
its turn based and can be hard to play if youre not used to this type of gameplay like me
i didnt so much enjoy this game
its well layed out and can be great fun if you have a great understanding of the paths to take
i couldnt get down a successful pattern though
you have to perform research for your civilization and you have to do so in an effective order or youll die or just lose another way
there are too many aspects of this game for me to enjoy itto those of you with technical issues i feel for you
there is nothing more frustrating then eagerly loading a new game on your pc that you have been anticipating only to have it crash
my rule of thumb is i dont even purchase a new game unless my comp meets or exceeds the recommended system requirements
this for me has kept me from writing some of the reviews i have been reading herei hope i might offer you all who couldnt successfully load the game some comfort
civ  is a huge disappointment
yes the graphics are better however the movies are worse then civ   it still takes forever to mobilize and transport your war machine against another nation despite a easier to use interface
a plus is you can still keep playing the game after you or an opponent has won without watching your fertile lands succomb to pollution as in civ   the game still has the annoyance of a warring nations soldiers miraculously appearing before one of you cities which i had hoped to see the last ofin summary sid failed to deliver in this new version
it is a graphically beefed up version of civ  that unfortunately is still riddled with many of the same problems previous edtitions have had
difficulty in communicating with other leaders monotony when creating units and transporting them to fight a war the same annoying hidden map same unbalanced game play against the computer i had an enemy musketeer take out one of my modern gunships
for as much as a resource hog the software is i was expecting something much much much betterim very glad i thought i could not wait until christmas to buy and play this game
it would have been a huge disappointment christmas morning
so those of you who cant play it consider yourselves lucky to not have endured the disappointment and those of you thinking of buying it hold out for aoeiii
hopefully they will do a better job of making their sequal then k games did for civs  and i was a big fan of the command and conquer series so i figured id enjoy this game
its true the graphics are great and theres a lot going on in the game but i found the fun quickly expired as things became so redundant and nauseating
i enjoyed it for about a week before i couldnt deal with it anymore
the warfare aspect is totally unfulfilling
the warriors are all braindead and stand still while being hammered by the enemy
you cannot have coordinated attacks
its one shot at a time totally boring
oh yeah i cant even figure out how to uninstall it from my system
they dont provide a uninstall icon in the program file and i cant locate it in the addremove programs tooldo yourself a favor and dont buy this gamecivilization iii was one of my favorite alltime games and i am an avid cityworld builder type games
however i feel civilization iv is most definitely not an improvement overall
in other words the sum of the parts does not equal the whole
i have had the game for only a few days and have basically decided that i have wasted 
i was under the impression that this game was awesome according to igncom and many reviews
they rated it at a  out of  i dont know how they came up with that but ill tell you what i think it should be rated at the end of the reviewfirst off i will state the good things about civilization iv
the graphics are most definitely improved over the previous version
recommended units for cities to build are given in the itenerary for each city
you are allowed a great deal of freedom in choosing how you want the earth to appearclimates land type world size how much water etc
in general the cities are complex you have the growth rate of the city the culture of the city and its resources
also the game camera allows you to zoom in and out variably instead of just three levels of zoomnow for the things you really must know about the game before you buy it
far and away this is the worst game i have played yet in terms of hardware requirements
granted i have a laptop but my hardware is ghz gen ii centrino mb of ddr ram gb hard drivegb of virtual memory mb ati mobility grpahics card running on dedicated memoryi say requirements because i mean you need much more than the minimum to even run the game without falling asleep waiting for anything to happen
i pressed alttab one time and it took well over  minutes to get the game back up again
it runs painfully slow and the thing that bothers me so much is why i could possibly need hardware better than mine just to get the game to run smoothly
someone else had a review on here that had a more powerful system thatn mine and the game had crashed on him multiple times
i play guild wars and it doesnt need near as much memory as this game doesi feel i must edit my review in light of a recent review
the following words were written by adam folkertsfirst off this game is great
it sucks you in and you lose track of time playing
the graphics are good the gameplay is smooth the ai is very well done
this is a definate buy game if you like the civ series or simulations in generalfor previous reviewers who have issues with this game i have had none
i do have a high end machine but you have to with the newer games out now
i wouldnt think about having an enjoyable game experience with a computer that is over  years oldi would reccomend atleast gb of ram a newer generation video card something past the ati radeon pro or nvidia fx
also youll need a decent cpu
youll need a higher end athlon xp in the  range or higher for amd i would say a newer  bit cpu if you want to really run this game right
since i dont use pentium chips i cant say what will run this smoothits true the minium on packages are sometimes misleading but if you plan on buying the newest games you have to be using hardware that was made in the last  years generally if you dont want issues
my system is an a  gb pc an nvidia gt and i had no issues and no slow downs
get the latest drivers they are always improving code to make things faster and fix bugsif you have a decent computer and want the game go ahead and pick it up
if you are using hardware made years or more ago get the game and spend some money upgrading your computer youll be glad you did
saying that you cant have a high end experience with a two year old computer is accurate however adam if you would have read a few more of the reviews you would have seen that people were running systems just as powerful as you with the game
i myself have a computer that is less than six months old
secondly if gb of ram was needed that should have been listed under recommended requirements
unfortunately they wouldnt have done that because then nobody would have bought it
the system requirements being misleading is an understatement
apparently we need a  computer to run civilization iv
also when i buy i game i dont expect to have to download drivers the very day i get it
im not a game tester this is supposed to be a finished product
it sounds like you work for firaxis or k games to methe second greatest downfall of civilization iv is the gameplay
it is uninspiring
you basically feel like you are just clicking and waiting for something to happen and nothing really does
the game doesnt even get interesting until you reach the end of the th millenium
battles are inconsistent
sometimes a weaker unit can overtake a stronger one and sometimes they cant
finally the main reason why i dont think you should purchase this game is the utter lack of creativity
all of the military units are the same
the countries are almost all the same
battles still occur on a tiletotile basis meaning it could literally take you decades to get troops from one side of the country to the other
by the time the th century came around i was completely bored with the game
it was years since the inception of civilization iii and this game seems like more of an update than a new game
aside from the graphics and camera controls this is civlization iii
the game is a serious dissapointment to me and i imagine most anyone who has played previous versions of civlizationim not trying to be a poster child for other games but i feel i should let people know what i would recommend in this games place
rise of nations is an excellent game which has about the same graphics but doesnt need  mb of memory
you could probably run it on  mb
because of that you dont have the huge waiting time for everything and its not turnbased so things happen at a reasonable time in the cities
moreover everything is in scale for the most part no one hundred foot tall people in rise of nations
it is also very similar to civilization iv but you could probably find it for about 
therefore would i suggest buying civilization iv
no
i probably wouldnt even buy it a year down the road when its cheaper
be smarter than i am and check multiple places for ratings and reviews of games
i lost  because of it
thanks ignmy rankgraphics gameplay creativeness replay value game value overall  out of ive been playing civilization for over a decade all the way back to civ i i excitedly buy  each installment of the series hoping thistime theyll get it right
but each time so much energy is put into graphics and bells and so little is changed to make the game more than a mindnumbing waste of time this from a guy who has spent hundreds maybe thousands of hours playing the games
i loose interest because all the wonderful subtlety constantly goes out the window with the inevitable surprise attack from a rd rate civ from the other side of the world
each game becomes just another race to get the techs that lead to the best gunsthe diplomacy is only marginally better than civ  trade and trade routes the most significant motivator in human history is and always has been pathetic
its still handed like spoiled kids trading snacks at lunchtime
ill give you my twinkie for your coal
religion is an interesting addition but its used in such a benign way it does little to change the game
the greatleaders seem exciting at first but it quickly becomes apparent they are little more than anonymous bonus cards that show up occasionally
while the graphics are at first impressive the game really dissolves into endless tedious hours pushing little animated soldiers around the screenthere is still no storyline
no random events to keep it interesting
still nothing to distinguish unique cultures beyond graphics and special units
the ai leaders act predictably hostile and uncooperative
there is no romance in the game
i dont mean royal arranged marriages i mean the thrill you get watching that online ad narrated by martin sheen
there is no epic sweep that could so easily be there if the authors spent less time animating little sprites you ignore by the third game and more time adding true personality
it needs heroes and revolutionaries pirates and brigands disasters and surprises
add real trade routes and the need to provision ships and caravans
that would make the map actually strategic instead of just a pixel battlefieldhow about colonies and revolutions
new civs that appear over time
how bout leaders that change over time
its so stupid to be negotiating with fdr in  bc
there are so many things that could be added to make the game more interseting and dynamic not just pretty to look atbut sadly even in civ  each game is very like the last only the map really ever changesfrom game to game or version to versionlike the three versions before civ iv is over by end of the bronze age
if you arent the undisputed top dog by ad you might as well cash in your chips
except for war there is no real unpredictability in the game
war wouldnt be so bad except its so tediously long
on this games calendar ike would have landed in normandy in  only a few years after napoleon finally got back from moscow
and frigates are still able to sink battleships and your tanks still burst into flames attacking knightsim always so hopeful loading in the newest version of civilization
but yet again i am disappointed
after all these years its still little more than a cross between sim city and riski was delighted to discover civ  in the store
ive been playing civ since civ  back in the early nineties
im not a fanatic but ive been playing steadily now for  years
not bad
i loaded this up on my computer which exceeds the recommended standards and was excited by the beautiful graphics and lovely music
i played almost a complete game saved it and went to bed
the next day my wife started a game saved it
i then tried to load my game and the crashes began
every time i try to load a saved game it crashes to desktop
then it began crashing in the middle of turns or before terraforming the world and then lastly it started causing my computer to reboot
i uninstalled the game reinstalled it
same problem
i installed the patch
no better
i uninstalled and reinstalled again
worse now
all i can say is that this is a great game that they let out of the gate too soon
im going to try to take this back but i bet i wont be able to do so
save your money until an updated stable version comes out
this one is too unstablehad been looking forward to this one for a long time
installed fine on a very nice and fast pc about a year old
very good graphics card and  gb ram
graphics seemed pretty decent and good framerate
but  after saving my game i could never play it again as my character was stuck floating continually
even tried uninstalling and reinstalling it
deleting the gamefiles everythingstill didnt work
so that made me finally get an xbox  and i havent regretted it
the graphics are way better in hd and the gameplay is better with the controllerwhile  may seem a large price to pay for one game  consider that just a new top of the line graphics card would run you well over great game
full of bugs for meso is anyone else wondering why bethesda posted false requirements for this game
i cant even begin how messed up this is
i give them kudos in producing an amazing title as well as being industry leaders for the advancement of next gen games
but it shouldnt be by ripping us off
geforce fx series
are you kidding me
people please lets make them right their wrongs
seriously its like buying a car that they say has an engine and then doesnt
completly worthless
and i can imagine the same people who are having these problems dont have the money to invest in a next gen video card because they asumed bethesda as a responsible corporation would assume liability for any misleadings
anyone with meif you played and enjoyed the outstanding es morrowind then do not get too excited about this gamegranted the graphics are outstanding to a point  your view distance is very short to maintain graphics quality hence you see things popping in front of you very closeall loot and creatures are leveled to your level so you can beat everything in the game and you wont get any cool loot for doing so
essentially there is no suspense that if you go through door a that you may get beat very badly
it does not matter  just charge ahead if you are level  then the creatures will be level   no challenge at allthe wilderness is empty i have cut across country as a level  and saw a total of  creatures in  minutes of random deep wilderness travel
 rats and  wolvesoverall the game is ok but will not hold your attention very long it is way to easy and obviously designed for those with short attention spans and needless simplicityive had this game for a couple years now
ive always been interested in historical events particularly wars and i have always wanted there to be a great game made about one of these events
in this case the civil war
but im afraid im still searching as ac divided nation clearly does not fit the bill for me
i bought it online thinking it would be sort of like command and conquer or age of empires which if it was like either it would totally kick butt
but its nothing like it
even after playing it many times i still find it frustrating
one major problem is it freaks out frequently and i have to close it and reopen it to fix it
another problem is it just seems rough around the edges like it was slapped together in a basement the night before it was due it doesnt seem fine tuned or anything
it is frequently confusing and reading the manual wont help because it doesnt address any of the problems so most of the time i would just tinker around until i finally figured it out or just give up
another thing that really made me mad was the little telegraph offices that are stationed around the map in random map mode every time i would march guys by them  or  guys would freeze if they touched it
i couldnt get most of them unstuck and ended up killing them to get them out of the way
it was like there was glue next to it or somethingthere are three modes campaign single skirmish and random map
the campaign follows a specific general like grant lee or jackson on several battles
single skirmish is just like it says there is only one battle instead of several like in campign
and random map is a poor attempt to copy cc
  instead of just being given the troops and resources like in the first two modes in random map you have to collect supplies and make men just like cc or age of empires
but everything is so much more confusing tedious and annoying that it just makes me quit and actually play cc even though i would rather play in a civil war erabottom line dont get this game if youre looking for a fun civil war game it also does the mexican war where you can be texas or mexico and the war of 
unfortunately to my knowledge there isnt a good civil war game out right now
history channel civil war gets like a  out of  on several gamer websites which isnt horrible but even the reviewer himself said it was only worth a few mindless hours of fighting and thats it
hopefully we will get lucky and some company will make a good game for pc ps xbox  or all of the above
this game isnt expensive at all but no sense to waste even  or  dollars on this as you will probably dislike it
you almost have to graduate from west point to be able to understand everything in this game
i think they went way over the top in trying to make it super realistic its like they were so intent on doing that that they forgot about the fun part
come on
the whole reason i play games is to have fun and relax not get frustrated and madthis game is designed for a twelve year old mentality
the jokes are childish stupid and the gameplay is repetitious predictable and boring
entirely script driven advance till you hit a trigger point kill  million monsters get an extra life and some other rewards advance to the next trigger point repeat repeat
basically you are required to navigate down a highly defined predetermined goright path with no variation
want to jump on some barrels get on top of that building
nope offlimits move along nowgraphically it looks pretty good but the cutscenes are prerendered the water effects are static guess im stilled spoiled by hl
at least it was only gta vice city was greatsan andreas was a big let down for mei expect games in a series to get better not worsethis one is not even near as good as vice cityit is more like gta it is selling in the stores now for  which is to highit is selling used on amazon at this time for  which is still to high especially for it usedi purchased it new awhile back for played it for a couple of hoursdecided it sucked and sold it it on amazon for  and that was the hot coffee versionlacking in story and gameplay
left me wishing for something better
i found it in left for dead and left for dead i didnt buy this game with very high expectations
the game only lasts a tad over  hours
yes you read right hours
thats like paying  dollars an hour to play
the graphics are extremely old school check out the specs on the box and decide for yourself i felt i was playing the thing or an old and very slow version of serious sam
otis the ai character you run into during the game is extremely stupidthere are times when a zombie is standing nose to nose with him and instead of raising his gun and firing he waits for you to take it out with your sniper rifle
i figured the game couldnt possibly be worse than the movie and i love romeros work but i was wrong
the music is monotonous killing the zombies is like shooting fish in a barrel not much challenge to it and there are too many glitches to list here
i gave it  stars because it was not the worst game ive ever played but definitely not on my top  list either
wait for it to go to the jewel case bargain bin folks
dont say i didnt warn yaif you have an older xbox this might help with heat a tiny bit but it will still red light on you
probably not worth the money overalli bought this game because i wanted to shoot monsters and i wanted to be scare
what a disappointment
the monsters look blocky and not scary
its a bloody game
theres a lot of killing
its tiresome after  minutes of killing people and monsters without any suspensewell ive had stubbs for over a year now and just tonight i popped it in and played it
first off i liked it
the sound graphics and ai is memorable but  minutes later i decided to quit due to the fact it got boring after a while same old rip this apart form the zombie horde die over and over you get the picturewell i went to play it again and then the errors start
i first get a message when i click the play button at the menu that the game has encountered an error and needs to close
ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling patches cracks even a couple of files for download off of the internet
finally i consulted aspyr an experience i shall not soon forget due to their inept workersi received the reply about oh  minutes ago ofi need to know more about your computer
i advise installing the latest drivers and updating some stuff on your computer
thats an exact copy and paste from what he said
i gave him however full technical documents via the dxdiag command in run
how much more info do you want buddy
would you like me to rip my computer apart and snap photos of it then upload them to you
my drivers are completely updated
what doesnt make any sense is that i played it for the first  minutes with no problems at all then it doesnt work
i didnt modify anything at all either
i just quit via the exit button
my request for answers was changed to resolved
the problem is not resolved
it would seem that they dont know what to do and so they stop trying to help
one thing is certain i will not be purchasing another item from aspyr until the day they are run out of the businessfrom what i played its not a bad game but it gets old after a short time
also dont expect any help if you have a problem
aspyrs tech support as you have hopefully read is about as helpful as asking a blind man to read a manual to you
they will stop trying before they even begin
stubbs had potential but its just too faultyi finished prey singleplayer and if i had to sum it all up in one word it would be tediousit seemed like every  mins your character believes it is over or almost over and then that stupid womans voice comes on saying no
its far from over
i was just like come on end already
the ai sucks the bad guys cant miss and dying often is unavoidable but meaningless
so it boils down to dying a bunch but regenerating your health in the spirit world and then just keep shooting until everything is dead
but since you simply cant dodge anything and you never run out of ammo it becomes a game of hide on the other side of a pillar if there is one and try to kill them faster and more times than they kill you
having played and enjoyed many other shooters i would say that this game really doesnt require much skill in comparison
there is no way to lose unless one of the lame puzzles actually stump you enough to give upin the end you always die dozens of time which makes me suspect this is why they had to include that healthregaining spiritworldthingy
it had to be that easy to get back in the game or you would simply get fed up and punch your monitor
sooooo tedious
addin the lame dialogue and acting and i couldnt wait for it to endmany players were pleased that the main character was a native american
that just felt like a gimmick to give him the spiritpowers or something like it
whateveranother main ingredient of this game was its puzzles i suppose
but none of them stumped me for more than a few seconds
they just took time and more annoyingly they brought the unimpressive action to a screeching halt which really didnt help
im sure some people enjoy this type of distraction in the middle of an action game but it certainly wasnt the cream in my coffee
i would have to laugh if anyone found them challenging or even stimulating
i wondered if they made them so easy to make the game accessible to a younger audience but that couldnt be what with all the cursing your character does
the cursing didnt bother me if you were wonderinganyway you might wonder why i kept at it well there are some favorable reviews here if you enjoyed it cool and i heard the game was short could have been much shorter and now i dont have to wonder if it gets any betterwell i paid my  bucks so i figure that i might as well try the multipreyer
ugh
from what i hear it is very good if not vomitinducing what with the use of its gravity tricks and all
puzzles should be absent here and skill will be more of a factor since you are up against other players but i still dont feel very excited because the weapons also fell short of anything spectacular
they seem to have no effect on anything they hit unless that creature actually dies
they could learn a real lesson from fear which really got that aspect rightwell here goesmy favorite singleplayer fps games fear
 call of dutythis is the perfect example of a game thats only rated well because of the graphics
while some games have awesome graphics and gameplay and deserve praise like half life  and far cry this game doesntit starts off really cool
youre a cherokee boy in a bar talking to your grandfather
you dont believe in his native american traditional ways and you want to get off the reservation
then something really crazy happens transporting you to the fps game and its all downhill from there
the shooting is just nothing new nothing that hasnt been done better before
one example of a game that really brought fresh and exciting gameplay to the world is the call of duty series and they did it with a wellworn genre world war  games and brought amazing life to weapons that are over  years old and had been featured in many games before
well it seems that prey has a great story here and they can invent any new weapon that they want but the gameplay is just boring i know the real reason this game is rated so high is because of  things  its new and the graphics
well ive seen better graphics and new does not equal better
even if im the only person on earth who thinks so i think this game is nothing special or particularly funthe graphics and gameplay are pretty good
not the best but worth picking up for a few days of fun and action
if possible try to pick up a used copy or one that is on salehowever i did need some support and the makers of this game was unwilling to give any
ive never heard of k games before but if they make anything else in the future ill avoid picking it up
there are no patches thier support forums are hardly worth visiting and when asked to support their game they flat out refuse to do itso buyer beware
when the game works it is pretty decent
when it doesnt you are screwed because there is little if any recourse especially since the store i bought it from refused to refund the money because it was an open product i dont blame them if i ran a computer game store id have the same policyanother fps set on a lifeless spacestationdid we really need another
plays just like halo  but with less weapons
graphics are excellent but nothing new or excitingi have the game on pc but would have preferred it on xbox
a controller is much easier to operate then keyboard and mouse especially when trying to manuver upside down and side ways and shoot at the same timeif this had come out a few years ago it would have been revolutionary but halo and doom have been there and done thata game that started out great but quickly became disappointinglet me explainthe pros
great graphics and good audio
easy to saveload with f and f respectively but there is little reason to use these
see cons 
below
a few new weapons and a couple of new transport systemsthe cons
repetitious play
about half way through youve met all the various aliens that are going to try to obstruct your pathall levels involve killing all the aliens to open up a portal to the next level
this is basically the entire game
there are a few levels involving some flying of a lightly armed shuttlecraft however the encounters with the enemy aircraft usually occur in an area where there is not much space and the enemy is much faster and more maneuverable than you
youre better off to quickly land your craft at a docking pod and engage the enemy fighters from the ground
but the most annoying feature of actual game play is the fact that it doesnt matter if you live of die in a fightwhy
well let me elaborate a little because you play a native cherokee indian you have connections to the spirit world
if you die you simply go to the spirit world restock up on hit points and return to the game at the point where you died
there is no reason to fight for your life if youre taking a beating just stand there get killed get automatically transported to the spririt world reload on hit points and start again where you left off
initially  this seemed like a great feature but it quickly became obvious that all the fun and uncertainty of major battles disappeared because you now can win all battles by simply wearing down your opponents hit points as heshe cannot renew theirs at crucial times like you can
the game is only available on the easy level until you beat it the first time the problem being i cant think of a single level id want to play again on any level
easy or difficult
also if you wanted to play the game again on the difficult level you must go through the entire bar sequence at the beginning of the game and also watch a prolonged movie segment at the start of the first level in the alien ship there is no way to skip these sections and they are tediously longall in all a game that had great potential but instead was a disappointment in many ways too easy and repetitious are just  of the a series of problems with this fps starsits a good shooter although i think the engine needs a lean leftright capability
but why do you have to kill children in one of the early levels
isnt that a little perverse
people will like this game no doubt but be aware its an adult game and parts can be hard to stomach
ymmvediti couldnt manage to sell this game in mint condition unregistered on amazoncom for a cutrate price
that ought to tell you what people think of prey these days
i went ahead and finished it and  wow just wow this is almost certainly the worst game ive ever played
as the hours plodded on i kept looking around for a fork to plunge into my neckthe later levels present one uninspiring challenge after another
as the game progresses it somehow becomes even less dynamic than it was in the beginning
the unreal engine really shows its age here with extremely limited movement or precision but that doesnt matter because the entire game is on rails anywayeach major fight is won by strafing and blasting  yawn  and as the monsters get more and more advanced their behavior is less and less interesting
some present no feedback whatsoever they just play out their scripts until you blast em dead
nothing is at all challenging about the ending levels  in one boss fight after discovering that movement wasnt any help i won by standing still and spamming the mouse button while reading the drudge report on another machine  but the truth is a challenge wouldnt matter anyway because the death  rebirth sequences seem to have no effect on your success or failure at all
the only way to lose is to literally get bored and quitthe glowy pixel light graphics are a high point and are used to good effect in many places such as the lightning gun the spirit tunnel and the gravity portals
but even that onetrick isnt enough to save this pony as the effect is so overused as to make gameplay impossible blasts of enemy pixel light fire so indistinct from their surrounding that theyre invisible seem to randomly assault the player in some encounters including the utterly contrived final boss fight
its a waste of a good technologyi never got to play multiplayer because the few servers still up are always completely empty
that should tell you somethingon final analysis this game is an incredible waste of time
dont recommend this to your friends or even your enemies
i would give it zero stars if i could ammend the ratingive been an rpg fan for quite a while now and the strongest games have always had excellent character development great story lines and a quality called soul
the successful games make you care about the characters and immerse you in the plot
however oblivion is just thati felt that i was in oblivion as the mechanics of the game merely gave me mindless tasks to fulfill without actually developing any sort of connection with the main characters or storythe game simply fails to draw me in
but i think for some having this detachment with the story and characters is a good thing if they are task oriented
on this level it is successful
think of this game as a megaversion of animal crossing except not as fun
get ready for the negative votes on this review lol
i am not saying it isnt a good game because lots of people like it
but for me it isnt a good game because of the reasons i stated
if you are a true rpg fan you may be as disappointed as i was with this game in spite of the immense world it offersthis is my fourth attempt at playing through this game in as many years
i felt i must have missed something if the reviews were so good
but after this last and final attempt to stick with this game i will sell it
there just isnt any soul to this game for me
it doesnt feel alive or real
the characters are cardboard cutouts and offer no depththere has to be more than a vast world to explore and in many instances for no real reason at all to really be a good rpg for memy gut feeling is that if you enjoy mmorpgs oblivion will be fun for you as it is basically a one person mmorpg with a world so big youll be exploring for months on end and perhaps this is the success of the game for somesorry guys oblivion didnt work for me but im glad other gamers enjoyed it and thats the whole point having funthough this is otherwise a remake of the snes classic final fantasy ii  iv there are some things to consider before purchasing the game
there are many obvious bugs which will often ruin gameplay
these bugs never should have made their way past test play
the fact that they werent even noticed  corrected during the north american localization leads me to wonder how lazy the developer really is given the opportune amount of time to deal with such apparent issuesi dont mean to bicker though the technical issues completely ruined this rerelease for me
first and foremost there are a number of artificial speedups and slowdowns on the overworld map and this is the first issue which i noticed during the opening sequence
secondly there is artifacting all over the map which is the result of unproperly adjusting the maps proportions to fit the resolution of the gba
this shouldnt even be a problem because any halfwit who knows how to use photoshop can avoid artifacting
third we move in to the newlyimplemented battle system which is an adaptation of the infamous atb system
a few of the problems here are lag times commands failing to register and shifty turns
these problems are quite annoying and can make combat unnecessarily frustrating
i honestly dont know how other people manage to overlook these thingsnow i have a few other serious issues with this game which arent necessarily related to bugs
one of the new features the bestiary allows the player to add defeated monsters to its databank for later viewing
simple enough
well it seems that the developers redid the encounter rates to make them predetermined upon starting a new game
in this sense there are no solid rare or common encounters as the encounter rates become subjective to the individual game itself
considering that ive played through the game roughly  times ive never been able to complete the bestiary due to uncommon encounters being too common and common encounters being too uncommon vice versa
doesnt make sense
it doesnt have to  the developer took a cheap route to make players invest more time in completing the gamemoreover many of the new features are completely unecessary ridiculous or both
without spoiling the game i can say that the difficulty though advertised as being based on the hardtype release is significantly nerfed by these additions
overall the game barely resembles the original in this right
albeit i have no reason to detail much else about this release as just about all the other details are generally covered in other reviewsthe game itself is a lot of fun i think the rest of the reviews have covered that very wellim running it on a twoyearold presario with a new midrange geforce video card and  gb of memory
the games a little sluggish even on the low graphics setting especially when scrolling around the map
this is a little bit annoying but doesnt affect gameplay that muchunfortunately the game crashes constantly after the world starts filling up with cities
the crashes are pretty baddumped back to windows which chugs and chugs for several minutes as it tries to clean up civs mess
on my machine im lucky if i can play three turns in a row after  or so without having to restart the gamea couple of minor irritations with my copy of the presell editionthe two cds are labeled disc   install and disc   play but you actually have to have the install disc in not the play disc when you start the gamealso the giant often very useful technologytree chart that came with my englishlanguage edition of the game is printed entirely in frenchi picked up the last copy of this from my local bestbuy and its already off my hands
why
because it only took a few hours for me to go all the way through the game
some people have complained that it was too much micromanagement but i felt it was really the oppositea superficial game lacking any meaningful depth or strategy on the level of something truly great like medieval total war
after i placed my settlers and staked out my cities i pretty much just hit enter a billion times only stopping every now and then to research something new or build military units when threatened
hugely disappointingas i mentioned in my review for civ ive been playing civilization in one form or another since the original game came out
every new edition has something about it that is enjoyable and something that you miss from previous versionson the whole civ  has many new and enjoyable features
animations are nice game play is balanced and the ai is very good when compared to previous versions
ingame movies are back when you build a wonder there are many options for simplifying or complicating game play based on your personal preference and leonard nemoy does many of the voices on the game
new civics model lets you customize your government more than in past ones want a government filled with godfearing christian communists
you can do it
 and the introduction of religion allows for some interesting subtletiesa fleet of missionaries can be as powerful in the long run as a fleet of battleships
when the game plays it is a pure joyhowever like many other reviews have noted playing the game is an exercise in frustration
while some folks seem to have no problems other folks have nothing but problems
my experience has been to load it on three separate machines one with nvida video card one with ati and one with intel
intel didnt work at all really but it should be noted that the machine barely met minimum specs
the other two machines did very well although they were well above minimum specs with mb video cards gig ram and dual ghz and ghz processors respectfully
also os was win xp sp and win xp media respectfully
both machines had late game crashes to desktop that got worse as game complexity increased increased number of cities increased land improvements increased visible map etc to where crashes were reliably occurring on maps greater than standard size every turn
smaller maps improved performance up to  turns before crashes but still crashedall of which brings us to the take home point
gone are the days of solid testing before a release
understandably games are more complex and home computer systems provide a nearly infinite range of configurations so a perfect game on release will probably never happen especially when one throws in business concerns
the sin here is not that the game is full of bugs  as noted this is really to be expected anymore
the unforgivable sin here is the total lack of customer support or failing that just a bit of empathyheck id settle for just a bit of respect to their customers by k games
again as noted in this review and on many web sites this aspect is totally lacking
given the aforementioned conclusion that any game should be expected to ship with bugs the expectation is that the customer service and support folks would be there for the people that spent their hard earned money on their yettobe fixed gamebottom line save your money until the patch is out for this and all future k games
you cant trust the company to do right by you
however once the patch is out by all means buy this gameafter alpha centauri and civ  i was hoping to get back to the pure fun that were civ 
i cant really put my finger on it but it didnt happencant quite put my finger on it
of course there are the bugs
lots and lots of them
this is just a badly packaged and tested game  i bought it on day  and the editor didnt bother to put up a support page for this game till about  or  days later  after various game sites had pages and pages of bug reportsbut even looking past the bugs not an easy thing to disregard believe me the game just isnt that much fun
the end game still involves drawn out slugging matches with guys who should know better
there is still much micromanaging to be done because the ai doesnt impress by the way it manages terrain improvements
the vaunted zoom feature
you quickly figure out that zooming too close is useless
use the wide angle and you cant really see what is happening so it is about as useful as the world minimap
so you are left with basically the same ol civ a bit more spruced upi played   or  games but then lost interest
been there done that
with less bugs
i am hoping that the python  xml scripting capabilities will result in good mods coming outpart of my problem is that i find the development vs warfare split distracting  i would rather play a wargame like rome total war or a game which included a lot less fighting and focussed more on development
doing both just doesnt thrill me that much anymorealong with religion the other decent addition was the unit experience and specialization model which rocks
and the encyclopedia was much better integrated this timei personally havent played the actual retail game but i played a demo for this game and to point just a few things outthe weapons sometimes wouldnt damage your enemy at all at close rangei found this to happen with the shotgunmagnumetc also for some strange reason some of the zombies can survive a headshot from a sniper riflegraphics were ok but overall they could have been betterif this game is coming out for the  your best bet would be to wait for that onea strangely incomplete little and i mean that literally game this in what appears to be an attempt to do what the nancy drew games do only with ghosts
are you fascinated yet
no me eitherthe game is a teen mystery adventure wandering through a decrepit old hotel helping ghosts find themselves and avoiding demontypes
its innocuous enough in that theres no blood no horrible slaughter nothing objectionable  in short nothing to give the kids nightmares
unfortunately that also means theres nothing to keep adults awakegraphics are good enough well almost and gameplay is intuitive and smooth
acting is a little better than it has to be
the music is surprisingly good and professional more so than the rest of the package
the writing is fine though nothing glorious
puzzles arent difficult and mostly a matter of pixelhuntingthe game as a whole reminds me of a student project
if thats what it is its really impressive  but as a commercial offering id like to see them try a little harder next time
come on guys get your act togetherok i loved this game at one time
i played before the combat upgrade
and well just got back into it again
and well as i got back in and right before i hit my highest level soe did it again they changed it
yeah the jedi and bounty hunters can do new things and than guess what they changed it again
i think if soe tried to stop being like wow and everquest they might have something good here
but until they stop changing game play and stop forcing people to do things they dont want to do they are just going to keep messing up a great game
but hey even lucas changes his movies all the time so the fan boys should be used to changes they dont like righti honestly think this is the last hurrah for star wars galaxies after changing there combat system twice in the last year it just shows that if they want to give this game a more star wars feel make a new gamei have played galaxies for almost  years now and yes it never felt like a star wars game i played it more like a fantasy game set in the future or as many called it everquest with a star wars skin i mean people were mainly battling with swords and warhammers power hammers and the armor they mainly used was called composite it looked like a cross between a cylon centurion and robocopgalaxies has never been a runaway hit and you would think with the star wars name it would be but like i stated before it never had a star wars feel enough to get star wars fans soela tried gimmicks like telling players how to become a jedithen many of the player base were grinding jedi but still didnt get any new customers with their be a jedi campaignsthe tried a combat revamp several months ago and released the total expansion which again failed to bring in many new customers so now the starter kit and the nge new game enhancmentsto make the game more star warsy the combat is a first person shooter type format ala battlefront and the took away almost all the old professions from over  to  based on star wars characters with pics and everythingbut asided from some new quests that in the beginning to make new players feel the game is more like star wars the truth is once those are done the game is pretty much the same as it always was just very difficult to reach higher levels and if you dont have the trials of obiwan expansion very difficult the game still has a lot of bugs weapons are all pretty much the same now some professions like trader and entertainer or all but useless it feels like this new combat system was rushed out the door just like the older one because they need new customers to keep the game from dyingin all honestly instead of changing the game every  months and totally destroying everything many players worked for for months and even years they should have cut their losses and tried star wars galaxies  instead of remaking the old game which still had many bugs and problems that needed to be fixed and put in something new which caused even more bugs and broke things that once was fixedi am only staying because of the friends i made their hard to go once you built up such a community but if they left i would have been already gone i would suggest trying a free trial if you canwell i got this memory card to go with my ps slim about  years ago
it gets  stars for having lasted so long
when i bought this i didnt know about all these negative reviews here so when i tried to load my game save today and it said corrupted data it came as a bit of a shock
corrupted data
but i was just playing this yesterday and it worked fine i thought to myself
then a second game save became corrupted
so then i went to amazon to see if others had experienced this problem and lo and behold they had
personally i consider myself lucky that mine lasted so long at all
still the knowledge that any game save that you are working on could suddenly corrupt at any time for no apparent reason is unsettling
i cant really recommend this item since theres no guarantee at all that your copy of the memory card would even last as long as mine did
in this case it seems best to shell out the extra money to get the sony memory card insteadthis game does not worth 
it plays like diablo
boring and boring and boringim not a very serious gamer having not played many video games since the nes until i recently got a wii and a psp
so understand that i am far from an expert hand at video games
yet even as a casual gamer i can say that untold legends the warriors code is mindnumbingly easy and consequently boring
i bought this game about a week ago and played it for a few days
after the first hour or so the controls the game play and unfortunately the limited scope of the game were readily apparent to me
after that i only absentmindedly played the game a few times while watching movies and i still triumphed over the dark forces threatening generic fantasy townessentially the game play consists of  walking around rather randomly  equipping your generic hero with weapons etc  pressing x in almost any combat situation to easily win and  occasionally pressing a shoulder button to take a potion
the largest problem is that there is hardly any challenge to the game play no difficult villains no puzzles etc
and whats worse is  that this easy game play takes place in a repetitive generic environment in the dungeons and woods though the graphics are pretty there is next to no variety  just treasure monsters items and portalsi suppose the game has value as a fairly mindless hack and slash actually given the simplicity of the game play maybe just one of the two actions would be more appropriate
however it is very easy and very repetitive
fortunately you can find it cheapmy title pretty much sums up this game the plot is full of holes
but thats not the only thing there are many other faults of this game which overall make it nearly unplayable
continue on brave readers for the rest of my reviewgraphics  lets start with the good parts of the game
the graphics of this game are absolutely beautiful
everything is lovely right down to the leaves on the trees
even your characters look excellent
everything is just amazingly greatmusic  the music is pretty good nothing too memorable though
but the music seems to fit the scenes and isnt irritating
there is one exception though
the baccula settlement music is irritating beyong all reason and is quite possibly the worst town music in an rpg i have ever heard
since you are in this town quite a bit it really lowers the music score
the voice acting is superb though
i believe the guy who voiced yuki is the same one who voiced vash in trigun
its just too bad the excellent voice actors didnt have better material to work withcharacters  while i didnt find anything wrong with yuki the rest of the characters range from dull and pointless to excruciatingly irritating
ulf and dahna dont really seem to serve much purpose and alfina is very annoying
she cries in almost every scene whether its warranted to not mostly not
i kept hoping shed die but alas no such luck
i remember coming to a certain place in the game and admiring how pretty it was when alfina melodramatically falls to her knees and starts crying all of a sudden about how deadlooking the place is
none of the other characters have much personality
i found miranda annoying but at least she had some sort of personality
alonso was my favorite character but he and miranda up and left the party never to be seen again more on this later
overall none of the characters had any development and either had no personality or extremely irritating onesstory  the story is almost as though several people each wrote their own version and then they all got together and swapped random pages to make one whole story
its just that incoherent
there are so many plot holes and random occurences that have no real explanation
for example yukis best friend says he will meet him at a certain city
i arrive hes nowhere to be found
then near the end of the game he shows up in a certain town in the middle of nowhere with no explanation as to where hes been the rest of the game and why hes here now
okay you may think this is just one little incident but the list goes on
theres a certain vilian whom i have no idea who he is or why hes even there
remember how miranda and alonso leave the party
no mention is ever made of where they went for the rest of the entire game
where did they go
why was yukis mother so young
they mention her youngness all the time but dont mention why and no mention is ever made of yukis father
why is raven so sinister looking
theres a certain pilot i assume died near the end of the game but why does no one ever mention it
i could go on and onaside from all these plotholes the main story itself is not impressive at all
it basically degenerates into a giant fetchquest having you travel from one place to another to get orbs from giant spirit creatures which seem to have no real purpose in defeating the final enemy
i tell you after slogging through a dungeon having a very short bit of heres the orb you need to hurry dialogue is not very rewarding at all
plus the love will conquer all theme made me want to gag
theres really nothing good about grandia s storybattle system  the combat system is just like its predecessors grandia  and  there is a little bar at the bottom of the screen which lets you know when your characters and the enemies will take their turn
if you hit one of the enemies while its icon is in a certain part of the bar you can cancel the attack
also you can perform special attacks if you can get one of your characters to knock an enemy into the air and a second character to hit the enemy at roughly the same time
i found this move almost impossible to pull off though
it is very hard to time it just right
speaking of difficulty the games enemies ramp up in difficulty almost impossibly near dragon valley
the only good place to level raise is near the end of the game which resulted in ridiculous amounts of level raising just so i could finish this monstrositygameplay  this is my catchall category
firstly i must say that the only thing i enjoyed about this game is the npcs
never have there been such welldeveloped and interesting npcs in an rpg ive played
i actually spent the last part of the game revisiting towns just to see what had happened to various npcs
however npcs should never be more interesting that the main characters
the fact that this occurs in this game bodes for more ill than good
another complaint i have in this area is the flying around in your airplane
it is very slow almost excruciatingly slow
i only did it to get to new areasafter that i used the instant teleport feature
it doesnt matter anyway theres really nothing to explore and the game had very few sidequests or minigamesoverall  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
overall the only fun to be had in this game is the colorful npcs
this however does not save this game from horridness in any way
the characters and story are terrible and this is really the meat of an rpg
while some may enjoy the challenge of the high difficulty level i did not
perhaps if the challenge part had been rewarded by an awesome story and lovable characters this game wouldve gotten a better score
as it is though there is really nothing about this game that made me want to slog through the difficult battles
overall i really cant recommend this game to anyone except those who will enjoy the challenge but dont care about the storyi guess i grew up between playing the second installment and this because whatever fun can be gained from the battle system is immediately marred by mediocre voice acting and an insultingly simple story riddled with what could be the most plot holes i have ever seen in a single gamei been home with broken leg for two months and ive been playing this game beta then demo a lot
i have more than a hundred hours experience
it is like bf  i like the game but i see one problem which will keep me from buying
no good comm system
clanners are using teamspeak etc non clanners cant compete
with teamspeak and your clan members you will own all
so makes a very one sided multiplayer experience
if you are in a clan buy if not be ware you will not make many pointsalso takes above average intelligence so if not b student you will not be happy
 like my brother who quit after two days single player bots are as dumb as dirt
so single player is a one day event
could have been  stars with voipbe advised this game is extremely crash prone and suffers from some extremely frustrating bugs  like character loss
the company admits to issues and claims to be trying to fix them but thus far theyve done nothingto top it off there are big balance issues later in the game that clearly show the game was not fully play tested
once again the developer claims to be working to address these issues  yet we see no patches to address themthe final nail in the coffin for this game is that it is short expect only  hours to finish the main quest on normal then you have to repeat the same game  more times to unlock all difficulty levelswhat a stinker of a gamethis is a beat em up game
and its pretty fun at times however there are certain sections that dont fit like entering passwords through a system of lights that you need to get to light up at the same time by hitting a certain combination of lights in order to open doors
this doesnt really fit with a beat em up game and makes it less fun as its hard as hell to actually pull this off
it would be alot more entertaining to beat a boss up and take his key or key card per the rest of the game
the graphics on the box look better than the graphics in the actual game which are quite poor for  or even any time
the original arcade version of final fight that was released nearly  years prior actually looks and plays better than this remakesequel
the camera couldnt be worse and merely gets in your wayfinal fight goes inner city with final fight x  streetwise
the soundtrack is full of rough music the scenes are concrete jungles with dirt and blood covered combatantstheres a ton of swearing in this game as well as hookers drug dealers and just about every other miscreant type you can imagine
i enjoy the grand theft auto series so im not a goodygoody  but it was a bit over the top herethe graphics were very jumpy with clipping problems and monotone objects
there were some nice interactivities being able to pick up garbage cans for example
still the world felt very forcedthe sound is ok although if this is going to be a storydriven game they should have gone for better voice actors
also very strangely the subtitles are usually off from what is being said
the soundtrack sounded like a cheezy version of a gangster  mobster moviei think in general that was the problem with most of the game
you could see where they were coming from and it might have been a ton of fun but its just not quite there
maybe they needed more time in development
the sound is ok but not great
the graphics are ok but not great
the storyline  dittoid rent this one first to see if you get drawn in before you buy itout of the box this game doesnt autoupdate properly
i made the mistake of downloading and installing a couple though so that i could play online and now its installed something like gb of updates and its still running
its taken multiple days to get caught up and its still running
furthermore whoever packages the updates doesnt have the common courtesy to wrap a few versions up for people with stock installs or some previous major update so im on patch  right now
it is incredibly frustrating having to go through this time and time again to get an online game going
you cant side step this entirely but i believe you can sidestep gb of the patches by skipping straight to the goty edition the menu of which magically appeared shortly after the biggest of the patchescareful if you dont however as a failed install of an update can trigger the need to reinstall the game and repeat this mindnumbingly long and arduous processdont let this turn you off on the game itself however
ive never seen it crash and while it mimicks many of the basic keyboard shortcuts and other aspects of previous rtses it still managed to break new ground in a number of areas
its a really good game and id be perfectly happy if it would ever let me playi agree with most everything folks have said about this game  you can only play allied in campaign game and not having an axis option is disappointing
once you play campaign game the skirmish mode is fun to but you can easily beat the ainow go multiplayer
the relic servers are located on the moon and my performance bar indicator never got above one out of five bars columbus ohio here
next you have the option of connecting to an existing game or play now automatch function where the system matches you up to another player or team
connecting to an existing game results in a cannot connect with other players error about  of the time
i know check the forum boards to find out system problemsopen ports firewalls blah blah blah
ive played dozens of online games with and without firewalls and routers and the bottom line is the good games dont give you such grief
automatch function is poorly designed and you end up waiting five minutes or more to actually get a match
then when youre in a match the game keeps track of your statsa nice feature right
wrong
whenever your opponent leaves abruptly they get a loss and you get locked up
if you leave you get the loss
ive played about  matches won  and lost the rest mostly because people bail just before they lose completely
if you buy this expecting decent online play save your moneyisnt fun
the characters are corny and stupid
its dumb
its not fun
its just a clone of grand theft auto
its got slow down issues
its basically the same open sandbox game as gta but it doesnt have the comedy or satire of gta
dumb
i spent  for it played it for a couple of hours and never played it again
i sold it a week later
dumb gamegta is way better than this
in gta you can fly planes or helicoptersparachutedrive motorcyclesand drive boats
in this game there are planes and helicopters but youre not allowed on themthere are no boats or motorcycles or bikes
only cars and a train
some of the voice acting in the game is really cheesy
i still like that you can create your own character but the idiot never talks through the whole game
the game gets really repetitve when you beat it unlike gta
if you played san andreas youll think this game is boring and dull
this is one of the worst gta clones ever made
if you want a better gta clone just get crackdownive bought this game  different times and both times have disappointed me its a beautiful game with a great soundtrack but the story is really stupid and non original its really fun when you first play it but it really lacks any replay value once youve already gotten all of the clothes and jewlery which isnt much theres nothing to do
just drive around and do the boring side missions
when you first play its fun just to rob people and make money to buy clothesthe game has a few fun points but overall the funness wears off fast
it gets really old really fast doing the same stupid quests over and overoverall i was disappointed with this game
the other reviewers have pointed out some real improvements to san andreas and i suppose there is something to that but theres something about not being able to fly a plane that just sucks
i finally found an airport drove around for like  minutes before finding a plane only to learn that i cant fly it
what a huge letdown as a gaming moment i mean i gave up on saints row right thereokay the map function is much better the navigation is much better there are lots of activities ways you can modify your character etc
the graphics are better but not by that much
but there are no motorcycles bicycles planes helicopters or jetpacks
the reason why rockstar is so brilliant is that they exponentially improve each version of gta but these guys basically cloned san andreas without the rural parts and without the vehicles and improved it  sort of in some areas onlyrockstar is going to eventually come out with something so much better than saints row that everyone will completely forget that game even existedafter san andreas i just cant be asked to play any gtatype game that does not have a working submarine plus skateboards bikes many different kinds of motorcycles and planes a hotair baloon a space shuttle parachutes speedboats jetskis rollerskates windsurfers canoes and maybe a shopping cart
its just not worth my time and i have no idea why a game maker would think it would be
all those things will be in the next rockstar game because those guys are not idiotsrent this game but dont blow  bucks on it not unless you really like the whole activities thingin a pathetic effort to cash in the on the success of grand theft auto the people at volition created what is a shining example of what grand theft auto would be if the people at dma didnt care about the gameri can hardly put into words how disgusted i am with this obscenely over hyped piece of garbarge but ill try for the sake of this very honest reviewsaints row is a video game where you drive fast cars that go beyond the speed of the xbox s ability to program your surroundingsi too recall playing some areas of grand theft auto and it taking a short while for the surrounding buildings to render
in saints row a game made in  mind you youll find yourself sitting on the road in the position youd be in while driving the car that just dissappearedin saints row you play a guy who doesnt speak at all and deal with idiotic cutscenes where characters from you got served try to exploit that for some comedy reliefthe storyline is as enthralling as playing the turf war missions in grand theft auto san andreas because thats pretty much all you do as far as that goesthe challenge in this game isnt simply dodging bullets and driving really fast its dealing with unrefined programming codein a mission where i had to protect someone they wouldnt get into the vehicle i had for them simply because the vehicle was on a slope
forget the fact that bullets were tearing through his flesh he just wasnt comfortable getting into a vehicle that was on a slopewhile shooting back at gang members at the end of a dead end alley i was suddenly shot from behind
looking behind me the game placed a car full of gang members directly behind me in that dead end alley
i died and at that moment decided to sell this piece of garbage gamethere are no motorcycles boats or helicopters that you can pilot
they put all their effort into the cars which fell short in my opinioni encourage anyone interested to rent this game and prove me wrong by getting excited more often than you want to just throw your controller at the tv
fair warning you might want the five dollars you paid to rent the game backafter finishing battlefield  and  and both bad company games i decided to give battlefield  a try and wish i didnt
from the horrible gameplay to the bad voice acting this entry in the series has no redeemable qualities at all
avoid at all costs
thanx for readingthere is no story line what so ever
the game play sucks
the graphics are okay
your much better off buying ghost recon advance  or fear
this one will leave you bored quickthe controls are very difficult and i understand they wanted realism but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to everything
im a longtime gamer and i can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme
plus for all the people talking about immersioni just dont see it
i just couldnt get myself to care about the world or story i was in it didnt grab me like some games doi spent some four years of being an uumlber star wars fan and spent a whole three years anxiously anticipating star wars episode iii which blew me away and i saw empire at war as something with great potentialexcept i wasnt very excited about it and didnt rush out to buy itnow i got the chance to play it and im very disappointedthe campaign map for galactic conquest moves very very slowly with a sluggish start for credits super expensive ships and an assload of buildings to be built before you can even start building capital ships of any importance
also autoresolving any battle immediately unbalances the battle giving the enemy the upper hand no matter how strong or numerous your forces are so unless you fight each and every single battle yourself youre bound to suffer exuberant casualties and even lose some surefire victoriesthe land battles are absolute trash
you start out with only enough room for five units which is actually troops with one troop of atst containing  atst  atat  stormtroopers etc while the enemy can field as many units as they want initially
it takes a long time to call in reinforcements while enemy units blow away at your units with little effortthe space battles are the real core of the game
the space battles are the absolute best aspect of the game despite their great flaws still
in the space battles you can only field units up to  population cap a single star destroyer takes up  pop cap
and it takes way too long to destroy even the smallest of capital ships so you pretty much sit there watching ships blast the  out of each other with realistic location damage for many many many minutes
also space battles can only occur when battling over a planet so your mission is always either destroy enemy space station or defend space station  the maps are also way too small with your forces constantly scrunched together held even further tightly packed by nebulae or asteroid fields or big fields of debris which block your units and do damage to your shields
fighters are difficult to maneuver also and arent very effective at anything save distracting other fighters
its all about the capital ships basically
and its all unbalanced in favor of the rebels who have the better variety of ships with better strengths and weaknesses including the mon calamari cruiser which is actually stronger than a star destroyer and whose only weakness is the tie bomber which usually never survives to reach the hull of a mon cal cruiserall in all terribly disappointing
it manages to keep me hooked for a brief while but only for that brief while
this is no battlefront or rome total war or age of empires or starcraftlike many i looked forward to this game for a long time
unfortunately the game makes itself very hard to like just through some unfortunate choices made by the developersfirst and very unfortunately this game is keyed to having the cd in your drive before it will launch
i thought this moronic style of copy protection was gone many years before this game came out but evidently not
especially when you must enter a long serial number when installing the game in the first place you should not have to keep track of and insert cds for the game to playnext i found the interface to be unnecessarily convoluted and not intuitive at all
just the organization of the areas didnt make a lot of sense to me with some of the buttons you need to use the most being small in size and squeezed inconveniently down into the lower left corner of the screen
some buttons to interface with the game have tooltips others do not
some seem to have tooltips only part of the time
lolin the play of the game itself there is indeed a lot of variety eventually in the types and functions of units
for example you can build smugglers for assignment to planets to leech wealth
however you sort of just have to know you can do that because the interface for using the smuggler doesnt show up until after you have built one selected him and selected a target worldas others have mentioned the game is supposed to be suitable for grand strategic play but it completely fails there
ive played enough small unit real time sims so i bought this game after reading promo material concerning the galactic map strategic play
the automatic combat resolution algorithms are badly broken meaning that if you want to make real progress you still have to rts all the battles
also a grand strategic play style cries out for turn based moves
if you happen to look up from this game for a few minutes of real world distraction  days of game time passfinally i found the game to be visually very poorly presented
even the very simple graphics presented on the galactic map appeared dull and clunky
increasing the screen resolution in video options surprisingly didnt improve the visual presentation of the game one bit
it was also difficult to do as unfortunately the dialog to change the screen resolution on my system caused the mouse to disappear until i minimized the game and then clicked to bring it back upi played the game onoff for several days playing the rebels i like challenges
my major problems are the space  maps are not that big with all the firepower the imp displayed in the game does not matter since the ai is a joke and the game ended too quick
by the time i was getting ready to enjoy the game with some decent cruisers for a change the game endedi would of love to play it through all the three movies but it only centered on the firstvery disappointedits really a superficial game lacking any real depth
like many rtss once you figure out how to win the game its basically over for you
you will stick around to launch a few star destroyers and play with the heroes but this game doesnt have more than a weeks or less worth of play to it reallydespite what others may have said this is a stripped down version of rebellion
the verity of ground and space units are very limited to what its potential could have been
there are only forty some planets to control compared with the more then a dozen solar systems  planets in each that rebellion possessed
but the most disappointing thing is the ai
in ground combat mode the ai will just come and attack you with minimal effort to draw them out
all you have to do is hold your position and wear them down
space combat is a little better but still too easy
i recently managed to fend off an attack on a space station with more then  dozen enemy capital ships and over  fighters and managed to lose a meager  capital ships
the only good thing about this game is the cinematic camera mode during space combat
lucas arts needs to release more patches to fix the unaddressed bugs that still plague the game
eaw needs heavy modding before it can be a game that can hold your attention for more then  hours of playability
a good attempt
but the producers defiantly dropped the ball on this onethe delivery service was excellent but when i put it in my gamecube which plays all of my other games perfectly it would not load
it was say something like disc could not be read
i even checked all of my other gamecube games and they all loaded without a problem so its not my system
i gave this a  because i know that the game is pretty awesome because i do have naruto clash of ninja  but naruto clash of ninja is just defective
however the condition i purchased was usedlike new and i ordered it along with  other usedlike new games from the same personplace that actually work without a problem and like new im too lazy to send it back though lol and i already have a lot of games that ive recently purchased to keep me satisfied
so its all good
doperation flashpoint looked interesting to me at first
the screenshots on the back of the box looked nice and it seemed to have the aspects of a military shooter that i might like such as medal of honor allied assault
when i first started the training mission i got a look at the gameplay itself
the graphics arent the best but that is never enough to turn me away from a game
however i couldnt get over the horrible looking face models of my soldiers
i dont mind the basicly square faces of the characters in spiderman for the playstation yet i cringe whenever i see someones face in this game
the player movement must be some of the worst ive seen in a fps
everything responds slowly and moves in a jerky fashion
the game also gives you many useless options like being able to sit salute and put your rifle on your back
for some reason you run faster with the gun in your hands them you do when its on your back just a few more complaints to get out of the way the mission objectives are uninteristing
the enemy ai doesnt make any kind of effort to find cover they just hit the dirt on sight and start fireing sometimes they even start running twards me during a firefight almost as if they want to get killed
the weapon effects are very dull and the voice acting is gritty
now for the good stuff that i could scrape out of this game
the maps are huge
and wide open
you dont have to follow your troops around if you dont want to
the cars trucks and jeeps are easy and fun to drive i often find myseld finding a jeep at a base during a mission and go cruising around the countryside which is by far the most fun i have had with this game but the air vehicles are another story
the cocpit inside of the helicopters look really cool but they would be more destrutive if i could get the thing to hold still
its impossible to take aim at a target when your flying over it with speed
the other vehicles are fair but still not the best in a game although the variaty and freedome to jump into any vehicle you can find is great
the weapon selection is ok but i wish that there were more fully automatic rifles
this game could be fun but it either doesnt have enough meat on the bones or too much for the casual gamer to be able to take a bite out ofthis game is marred by awkward touchy controls and ugly visualsgrabbed this in hopes of having a solid military sim on console
while the game takes pride in providing a relatively hardcore experience in this respect poor aiming more than does the job at turning your time with the game into an infuriating one
with a shooter especially on a controller you need the aiming to be as precise and smooth feeling as possible
it really just makes most engagements a chore to take onadd ugly muddy visuals with lots of fogging and you have a product that neither plays well nor is it anything to look atsadly i say avoid
even with the lack of proper military sims on console this one simply is not worth your timedont buy this game
whoever said that this was a worthy successor to masters of orion ii should be killed
this game is awful
you dont get to do anything
neither the fleet combats nor the ground combats are interactiveall you get to do is watch
the micromanagement gets old if you have more than a few planets and the technologytree is difficult to use
considering how little you get to do you might as well go watch tv
instead
this game is garbage
i wish i could get my money backi cant believe this product was released as it is
they took what would have been a near perfect probably a  star i rarely give  item and lessened it dramatically by not allowing access to the headphones  av out jack
i knew this would be something of an issue when i ordered it thanks to a previous post on this product
however they failed to mention that it was completely inaccessible
i made sure i had l shaped connector on my headphones as was advised by previous poster on this product but when i received my comfort grips and inserted my psp the headphone jack which also doubles as the av jack is completely blocked and the external speakers on a psp are not very loud
the one consideration here is i have a slim psp  i do not know if this makes a difference in the accessibility to the headphone jack or not
if you dont use headphones this would be a great item for you or maybe the l shaped headphone connector caveat is applicable to the original psp models which would also make this a good item
for me with a slim psp and my headphone jack completely blocked off this only gets  stars and sends me back to the shopping cart ever heard of beatmania
probably not
beatmania is a japanese game where you hit buttons on a board and use a turntable to scratch with
it was first created in  when konami started their music game campaign in japan taking arcades by storm
the notes had to be in a timely order with what was on the screenfast forward to  and you have guitar hero
a game where you pick up a plastic guitar and strum to the modern and classic riffs of guitar bands
you had to play the notes in timely order of what was shown on the screenguitar hero is cool despite the yearold looking plastic guitar because of the music
in terms of innovation or orginality there is none
guitar hero is exactly the same game that beatmania is but it has different music
the scoring system is the same the level progression even the breaks in the song if you screw up the riffs are the same as beatmania
the only difference is you use a plastic guitar while with beatmania you hit big buttons on a board to annoying jpop songsdave chappelle said it best when he told his audience white people relate to electric guitar
this is exactly why guitar hero is so popular in north america right now
red octane simply took beatmania and made it for white people to enjoy
the music drives people to play this game and the licensing will get everyone from a metalhead to a gothemo kid wishing they were in a band after playing
this game will be a blast to play if you like or ever liked rock musicif konami never released their musicdance games red octane would be out of business
i think this game is fun for what its worth but in terms of innovation id give it a zero
i endured listening to jpop on beatmania so im glad red octane made something worth playing for people in the stateswas hoping for a fun game however graphics are bad game play is slow save your money and buy any of the silent hunter games instead
review bassed on  yr old stepsons inputa sudden unexplained urge came over me as i entered best buy with a group of friends and headed towards the video game aisle
i had known about this game for ages and had never even thought of touching it
in fact i had never even played an mmo before yet  years after the release of one of the worlds bestselling mmos to date i found myself exiting the store with world of warcraft and the burning crusade expansion
i truly could not explain my unnatural desires in fact it was only through the fact that a friend played that i succumbed to said urges
had i been wiser i would have taken heed his telling eyes cold and lifeless urging me to stay away
his words and affirmations were weak and unconvincing and for a reason
he did not want to play with me
he did not want me to play at allthis game has a sinister secret one that took me awhile to realize myself this game tricks you into thinking its actually fun
oh youll think its fun i did but after about a month it hit me this game kinda sucks
i played this game for a month and a half and immediately after cancelling my account played one round of team fortress classic and one round of battlefield  and honest to god had more fun in those  rounds than all the time spent in this game combined
dont get me wrong this game has its good points but they are not enough to warrant the thousands of hours youll have to dedicate to this game to get anywhere or do anythingfirst off it takes forever to run anywhere
i didnt notice this at first but after  hours you realize crap i just wasted  hours doing and then turning in  quests
im not exaggerating at all
it honestly took me about  hours to do  quests
people will be like well you get a mount at level  well wow thats level  and im level  and it took me a month and a half to get here
so no i really dont feel like waiting for some stupid mount at level  because it will take me  months to get it
speaking of doing quests at the beginning i read everything i was so excited
i never skip cutscenes in games and could honestly see myself as a writer for video games so i was kinda interested
after a while it pretty much boils down to some dude going get  goretusk gall bladders so i can bake this pie for my son which you realize after reading like  paragraphs
most all quests are like this and according to my roomate who played till level  and got sucked back in to play with me this time around all the later quests are here talk to this person halfway across the world and then travel halfway across the world back to turn it in
wow some good that mount does when you have to take basically the same amount of time to do the questsanother thing on a related note is that this game basically discourages you from exploring
that was one of my main attractions of the game and one of the things i thought id have the most fun doing because of the amazing art direction but then you realize theres always gonna be a quest that you could have done there
once you get in this mentality you will never want to explore anywhere and once you do do the quest youll have explored and never wanna go there again
and thats even if there is a quest there
so many times ive passed up a new area using that logic and then ill just never go there because ill never get a quest for that area
not to mention half the times therell be highlevel creeps computercontrolled enemies that see you from a mile off and hone in to kill youthe second thing that really pissed me off is the level differences
i got this game to play with my friend but unfortunately my friend became a level  in all of  seconds and i cant do anything with him
wow thats fun he kills some stuff for me in like  seconds so i get a quest done
wow lets do that for an hour or two this is amazing watching my friend instantly kill all enemies
my roomate started over with me and yet unless you both play at the exact same time always you run the risk of being different levels which again means you pretty much cant play with each other especially after like  or  levels difference because then you cant get or share certain quests because you are too low level
i dont really know how they could avoid this but it is just so frustrating
the level differences also make it impossible to cross anywhere on a pvp server without some higherlevel guy killing everyone including weak lowlevel guys just for fun
if you are saying play on a non pvp server well no see cause i got this multiplayer game and i like my multiplayer games multiplayer so no i will not join a server where i basically cant even fight the other team unless i get lucky that we both have pvp toggled and are magically within a  level difference
you can fight in arenas but whatever that doesnt cut itthe third thing is basically forget about this game if you have some semblence of a social life
unless you play this game  you will never reap the benefits of hitting level  the benefits by the way of reaching level  are basically not having anything to do anymore
you will be able to expore outland at this point but then all you really have to do is get armor and do instances instances are basically private dungeons that you and like  other people go in and usually have a big boss in the end
instances by the way are either really fun or really frustrating
they are a pain to put together and half the time people will leave like an hour and a half through right at the boss ive honestly had this happen twice and is extremely frustrating if you need to beat the boss for a quest
people in groups will either consist ofa dudes who take the game way too seriously and get so mad when you do anything out of line even if it is more fun to fight  enemies at once that might kill you
some dude actually told me to wait while he pulled the enemies and fought them himself and our other  party members just sat around waitingb little kids who dont know what theyre doing and get you killedsteal all your lootcheststime by leaving early because its their bed time at c guy whos not a priest
if you dont have a priest or paladin in your group which a decent amount of times you wont expect to have to run back for  minutes after being wiped meaning your party got killed and you get to resurect at a graveyard and run  miles back to the dungeon entrance and then back where you got killed in the dungeon
so basically there will almost always be enemies respawning on the way to get there in the cave or whatever that leads to the instance that will probably kill you a few times
yaythe fourth and probably final thing is that nothing in this game ever changes
this is apparantly the world of warcraft yet all you do is fight stupid little enemies that respawn in specified areas
even the actual players pretty much have to fight each other in specified areas neutral zonesarenas
there is no war going on
this game would be almost  times better if you could actually lose territories in the game
if a raid comes into your town and defeats the enemies there it should become that sides territory
things around you should change
im tired of going outside silvermoon city seeing some stupid soldier npcs  nonplayable characters aka characters in the game controlled by the computer standing around saying they are in battle and want you to kill some undead guys down yonder killing them and then having  the undead guys respawn and the soldier npcs who gave me the quest  and dont help you fight the undead guys by the way supposedly being in battle just stand there for the rest of the game
that is so stupid
i dont know what they could do at this point to change it but it just takes me out of the game so much to see stupid things like this all the timewhen i eventually decided to quit this game i felt its addictive nature take hold
my hand was hovering over the final confirm button and i honestly didnt want to make the little peon cry
it probably made up about half of the reasons not to quit
but the second i hit that button i felt the biggest sense of relief in my entire life
everytime i looked over for the next  weeks or so and watched my roomate who eventually quit taking ten hours to run somewhere to do something stupid to get something stupid i knew i made the right decisioni now waste my life playing different video games
they however are  times more fun and dont require a montly fee
oh and there is a th thing this game stole  and a month and a half of my life away and frankly id like it all back pleasein my quest to play every racing game on the ds it has become cartoon network racings turn
i guess i dont watch cartoon network as i have heard of absolutely none of these characters but i decided to try it out anywayits very much obviously a ripoff of mario kart yet lacks in the fun you can have in that game with both ingame fun and minigame fun
there are  or maybe  events each with about  tracks to race on
you get a selection of cartoon network characters to choose from with a heap to unlock later
each car has its own attributes and abilities and probably special power ups but i found this game to be one of those highly annoying games where its the karts you unlock later that go faster then the ones you have to put up with at firstthe tracks are much like a mario kart race from circuits beaches deserts and schools etc to race on
the handling is decent once you get used to it its a standard racing game one button to accelerate one to brake and one to use your power up item when you run into a block on the track
there is also a button to slide but its not for sliding drifting around corners its more a mostly useless button that you only need to make a sharp turn into an object or a quick slide to prevent hitting a wall however if you are used to mario karts slide then dont bother trying it you will just turn into a wall if you dothe powerups are identical to mario kart
boosters projectiles and things to leave on the track like mines and oil spills and what not
the whole thing is a watered down rip off of mario kart and it was decent enough to be slightly fun at first but it becomes completely annoying after a while when you are cruising along in first place and every few seconds an opponent behind you has projectiles something at you you see a warning icon which i couldnt figure out why it would bother as you cant defend it unless you have a temporary shield power up to activate but i got so sick and tired of seeing that warning icon then a stupid whistle sound as it collides into you and you tumble around in the air and land back on the track to resume racing even tho it does not slow you down all that much and you can continue on with ease in first place it was just irritating for it to keep happening every few secondsits also one of those games where you have to collect things on the track to earn tokens to unlock things these things are upgrades mini games new charactervehicles and some cartoons to watch but whats annoying is some cost a ridicules amount you can earn probably  or so tokens for each championship but to unlock the black sheep cartoon to watch it will cost you  can any one really be bothered playing the game for that long to earn that many pointstokenscoinsi can tell you now if you want to see what you would get by wasting all that time unlocking everything then when you enter your name for the game type in gimmie and everything will be unlocked but you will not be able to save any progress this was
this opens everything for you to see and you can see the rest of the characters to unlock might get faster and better to use but the mini games are a snore fest and the cartoons are a nice addition as they are short but full length episodes but as i said i dont watch cartoon network so they did not appeal to me but for someone who loves the shows then unlocking  of them to watch without just imputing that gimmie name code then you may be wrapped to be awarded with that feature to be unlockedoverall it just become too repetitive and more annoying as it went along
i just did not care to complete the whole game if you own mario kart you will see this is a major attempt to try and clone it but it gets it all wrong in the end
even tho the graphics arent all that bad and the controls are decent there was just so much more that was needed to improve this game
if the price is right and your kids love cartoon network then it might be a decent buy for them but i can tell you now it will get old quicklyi played homm v until i got to the end of one of the senarios where it would lock up 
i took the game back to the store two times  but the game still froze up at the end of the same senario 
so i sent the game back to the company like i have done before with other game companies 
ubisoft sent my game back to me with a letter saying i had to call  or email them for payment info before they could fix the game  and top of that the game looked like someone stepped on it 
it was smashed 
im not going to pay them to fix a game they could not make right in the first place 
i sent the game back to them with a letter of my own 
i never had this problem with any of the other game companies  because they would just send me a new game   i didnt have to pay anything 
i wish do was still making the homm series the game is beautiful the graphics are amazing the gameplay is very interesting
however there is a neverending lag
my computer exceeds the game requirements and i dont know where the lag is coming from
the game wouldve been great if it wasnt for the lagive played all the hmm games and was really looking forward to this one too
i was extreamly disappointed with it
i did not like the new graphics they seemed too cartoony to me
they did away with caravans which i enjoyed in hmm
i enjoy playing the side quests more than i enjoy the main quests and hmm didnt have very many of them
an ok game but not worth 
if youre a hmm fan  wait for the price to go downwas hopeful and perhaps deceived by some of the very good cinematics that came out before game releasea legitimate effort was made to implement at least partial  d while preserving  an impressive level of details
however overall graphics are very awkard a bit bulky characters out of proportion
finding puzzles locations can become ridiculously difficult to locate
initially liked the impressive towns graphics but quickly becomes cumbersomestory a bit weak
music is as always very good
overall reduction in fun vs heroes  and heroes of might and magic v is a giant step backwards for not only its previous incarnations but for strategy gaming in generalmoves towards greater story town hero troop and combat development have been completely abandoned and the game bears only a slight similarity to the might and magic seriesthe races and their units have more in common with kohan or age of wonders then they do with the might and magic series
the campaign game is not only linear there are no choices to make at all
simply solve one goal to move onto the next often to find out that what you were doing was pointless because of a plot twist
artifacts wealth generally your accomplishments in the previous campaign do not carry over to the next step of the campaign
many of the missions lack a city or army building component whatsoever and become forced marches on a board you can only get through by multiple attempts to uncover the best routethe storyline is generic and lacks imagination
it is poorly written as well
in the opening sequence just after the future queen has her wedding crashed by demons she laments maybe i should have learned to fight
in the very next scene she is in full plate mail telling her second in command that she has always been more comfortable in a battlecamp than in court
what the
if you must have the game why not wait a few months for the price to come down
it is simply so lackluster it does not deserve a price tag higher than i found a number of problems in this first unpatched pc release of scda and a few style changes that makes the game feel more like a console game than pc cant customize mouse buttons they are fixed on fire and altfire unlockable items dont unlock while using pistol to disrupt a light i was not able to holster the pistol until i fired a shot from it after i knock out a person the game forces me to pick him up
i dont want to pick up a person every time i choke them down game runs much slower than previous sc gamesa few interface changes i didnt like which are subjective sam looks like a walking traffic lightfor the stealth indicator a component on sams suit turns bright red yellow or green to determine how visible he is
this indicator takes immersion away from the character since it looks silly to see an agent walk around with a brightcolored light emitting from his back
it looks like he is trying to direct traffic rather than sneak around interaction interface uses big icons instead of textbased menu as in the previous games
its annoying to guess what icons are what when quickly trying to pick an option and i found the textbased options from previous versions bettergraphically the game does look good with hdr and levels appear more detailedoverall there should be more options and customization available for pc users since customization is an advantage of the pc platform
ubisoft should have left the game to cook longer with qa before releasegame loses  star for bad qa  star for performance and  star for lack of pc control customization
if you have to buy the game buy it used
who knows if and when ubisoft will patch the game to make it more enjoyable for pc customersif ubisoft patches the game to address these issues then i will edit and change this review accordinglypositivesthe graphics are decentthe voice acting is okaynegativesthe dialoguevoice sound is too low even though the sound options are on high in the game preferences
after googling the problem it seems that others have experienced the same thingwhen i start the game after the ubisoft and unreal splash screens go away it takes  seconds for the main menu to appearand any time that you go back to the main menuanother  seconds
its annoying and a waste of time
a longer delay happens when a saved game is loading  seconds
and if you alttab to windows and then alttab back to the game then you will need to wait for the game to loadagain
i havent played a game that makes you wait this much for menus and loadingthe new ingame menu is graphical big and right in the middle of the screen it is a step down when compared to chaos theory
navigating the ingame menu and computersemails is cumbersomethe story itself takes a very odd twist after the first mission why the twist occurs is unclear
at first it is not clear whyhow sam becomes a double agent and this makes the first jba hq mission objectives confusingwhen grabbing a rope or other objects sometimes you have to be precisely abovebelownext to the object
if you are just a tiny bit to either side of the object then it wont respondthe jba hq map is used  times in the game for  of  maps
maybe that is needed for the storyline but it adds repetition to the game
the kinshasa map is used  timesmore repetitionin the jba maps when walking down stairs you walk in slow motionweird and annoyingsafe cracking glitchbug for those missions that have a safe cracking objective you must be in run mode in order to crack the safe
if not then you cant move the safes cylinder during the safe cracking minigame
to be in run mode move your mouse wheel forward or whatever key you have run mode configured tosome objectives are really obscure it can be difficult to tell what you are supposed to do next and where you should go and why
if you get frustrated use a walkthroughthe ingame maps are cumbersome and uselessotherthe story is just soso
having both jba and nsa people talking to you at nearly the same times during missions seemed fake
i played about half of the game and then i quit playing
i just got bored with it and lost interesttom clancys splinter cell chaos theorywas much betterthe seller was phife
i bought it used and paid  bucksvisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsthis game has so many bugs which to this date are not fixed
i have the latest patch which is supposed to have fixed the big ones  such as the safe opening issues  but it hasnta part from the bugs the missions are just tedious not really much fun like previous seriescontrol is awkward evidence of a bad port from consolemy advice is to stay away from this onei was really anticipating the release of double agent for the pc
i loved the original splinter cell pandora tomorrow and chaos theory the encore version without starforce drivers
double agent has got to be the worst game of the series by fardouble agent is an obvious console port and not ready to be released on the pc
ubi is not offering any patches to really address the major issues with this game either
this game is highly unstable on the pc
several people have had problems with crashes and serious lagging
with the options turned down and no matter what kind of system you have you will most likely encounter some serious choppiness and lagging
it really starts to get bad in about the third level of the single player game
also if you make any changes to the video settings and hit apply crash back to the desktop
this happened to me several timesone problem that you will first notice with this game are the load screens
there are two load screens and they take forever
you just sit there waiting and waiting and watching the little circle go round and round until finally the level loads
as far as the actual game play its not near as good as the first three splinter cell games
its too linear this time around with lots of scripted and timed scenes
in the end double agent was just too unstable for the pc
the instability really takes away from the enjoyment factorlike most folks are stating this game is full of bugs
the story seems ok could use a lot more interaction and explanation of what is going on
its never really clear what happened to fishers daughter and why the nsa is targeting the jba
there are some significant gaps in the story
i missed the news stories from other sc titles that tied up the loose endsi have an intel x cpu and evga  gtx so i have the hardware for this game and it runs relatively well and looks great
unfortunately the  gtx has issues with the game and you need to run the game with a ll switch option
so my intro to the game was a crash to desktop upon starting it until i read about the work around
this was just launching the game goes down hill after thatseems the game doesnt really save the only saves that work are loaded using the load last save option
you cant load any other saves
as many fans know its real important in this game to have lots of save options to try out different solutionsseems the game doesnt like usb keyboards see gamespy review
this effects some key game play elements such as safe crackingthe designers introduced some imo terrible elements to the game that are not fun
an example would be a sequence where you need to put mines together
its not fun its frustrating and it has nothing to do with what splinter cell fans like
these new elements just slow the game downthe ui is also a notch below other splinter cell games and definitely hampered by the console influence of the game
from the option screens to the save and load screens its a bit of a fightas someone else mentioned the ai has taken a bit of a nose dive
it can be broad daylight and you are jumping in front of the npcs and they wont see you at times
sometimes youll be in complete darkness and theyll nail you
the light meter is useless in this gamethe tutorial is aweful
you are put into a virtual training room that is all white
kind of artistic but it doesnt do what its supposed to do provide training for the game
this is one thing the other sc games have done very welli looked forward to this game and was very disappointed with its quality
if you have an xbox  i suggest trying that version as i hear its hassle free
i want to make it clear that the story and general game play are still very much like other splinter cell titles its just that the quality of the pc version is terrible
maybe well see a patch or patches to resolve these issues though ubisoft has already stated there would not be future patchesthe only clue that this is a benoit sokal game is the sketch book like the one in amerzone
otherwise you would think that this is a creditable first time effort by someone
the graphics are average
the plot is cumbersome and tepid
the dialogue is pointlessthe first rule of a storyteller is to get the attention of the audience
here that is not true
the game starts off with several hours of puzzles which serve no purpose
imagine congratulating yourself on solving some five or six puzzles only to find out that they were totally unnecessary
not an auspicious beginning to a game
when the story finally starts it is rambling and uncertain
you wonder exactly what this game is about after all
this is completely uncharateristic of a sokal gamethere is a black leopard in the game
here sokal is at his best
the representation is amazing
however that is the only interest in the game
it is my belief that all the effort was directed to the sketch book and the leopard and then a game was tacked onthis is not a bad game but it is one that you will find easy to put downthis game isnt very fun
and the graphics are quite subpar for being a ps game
thank goodness i rented it because if i would have bought it for full price id be kicking myself for itis this a horrible game
no
but is it good
i dont think sothe worst thing about it is probably the graphics
everyones arms are way too long and that looks very tackythe gameplay is ok at times i tried to force myself to play with cool characters such as knuckles the echidna but that didnt change the gameplay much
you race on air boards and if i recall correctly there are special spots where you can get a boost
oh yeah and you have to refill your board with air to continue on after a whilei dont think this is even worth  bucks
if you can find it for  dollars or less go ahead and try it  you might like it for that pricebut if youre smart you wont purchase it at allbelieve me  i really wanted to like this game
i saw the commercial and thought it looked cool and im a big fan of some of the sonic titles sonic adventure  battle is my favorite but it just didnt satisfy my tastesa crappy nearlydeleted of all signs of life
if you wanna laugh then get this
but then the hysteria will quickly turn to tears i swearcover art binside art graphics fcharacters acharacter models f seriously
never in my godforsaken life have i seen them do this much of a pisspoor job with them
amy and the crew look like their arms have been stretched to all lengths of hell in some strange arse torture chamber
yuck
wait and see

ever experiencedyes
i said
worse
than
sonic
spinball
mopes quietly in a corner starscant get in to this one it is lame player is always moving forward no matter what not much control over game not good at all
may be for younger kids it would be fun just let the screen scroll and move the player around a little terrible gameas an adult gamer i thought id try this game and see what its aboutif you like driving or racing games this is for youit reminds me of pac n roll ds where the pac man rolls down lanes
this game is similar
you have to roll the ball with the monkey inside it down certain paths collect bananas along the way and race against time to the goal
thats basically it for this gamei can see where kids would enjoy this simple  cute game
the graphics are nice and in d
the stylus can be used in this game but the buttons are preferred for better controli am not into racing or driving games so in my opinion i gave this  starsprey is an id software title thats built off the doom  physics engine
it looks a lot more polished than doom due in no small part to the s hardware and it looks much brighter than doom  although thats not saying its a bright and cheary game by any stretchthe game follows tommy a cherokee indian who is abducted by aliens and must fight his way to save his girl and destroy the evil aliens
that really is by the way about as complex as the story getsthe game play is pretty linear but there are some interesting puzzles
the physics are really weird in this game  sometimes youll have to walk on walls or ceilings which makes shooting bad guys uniquely challengingbut this game is pretty short  maybe eight or ten hours on the story mode
its also not anything new
its your standard fps with weapons that basically behave like weapons youve seen in most other fps
the online mode is very laggy
to get the last couple of hundred achivement points youll have to play online
as bad as my experience online was im surprised anyone is playing this onlinethe game like doom  also lacks splitscreen play ie
you cant have your friends over to play prey deathmatch
this may sound like a small complaint but since online play stinks its really the only way to play deathmatch besides system link which would work if you have  soverall this game is a good renter  i was able to beat it in a weekend with plenty of time to spare
its game play is a little innovative and the graphics are quite nice
but once youve played the single player story youve really tapped out the potential for this gameim a fps freak
i love em
having recently finished gears of war rd person shooter call of duty  and time shift i have gotten very spoiled
all  of those games are second to none
so when i play a game my expectation bar is pretty highim only going to go into the major flaw of prey because for me its a deal breakerthe primary problem is the actual shooting of the aliens the main crux of the game
when you fire at them its hard to tell if you even hit them because all that happens is a little scene of blood splatter which may or may not be in the area you actually hit them
theres no realism in it at all
the doom  engine is just too outdated to compete with the other games out today
it falls way short of what i expect from a fpssure the scenery and the teleporation and other gimmicks are fun for about  minutes but if all im doing is going from dark room to dark room firing at aliens in an original xbox doomesque manner im getting bored very fast
so fast in fact i put the game back in the case after  of  levels
an xbox  game this is notif you loved gears of war time shift or call of duty  i would recommend staying away from prey
you will really be disappointedloose gamplay bad graphics decent storyline but i bought a game not a movie so if you dont back up your story with a game it is boring and dull
dont buy this gamei liked some aspects of this game considering when it was released
the interface wasnt great
i just dont see myself playing it very ofteni have yet to see this game played smoothly on any box
i have two high end systems that both slow to a crawl a key parts of the gamesame with my friends systems
maybe if youve got an sli setup with multicore youll see good framerates otherwise its a bigtime jerkfest
the minimum requirements posted on the box are a joke and are bound to lead to people buying this game who simply cant play it
it would really be good to see some game companies called on the carpet for their bogus system requirements
on any other product this would be called baitandswitch false advertising but game developers just get a passthe single player campaigns which is why i bought the game are pretty thin compared to other games of this type
they sure dont hold a candle to any of the warcraft titles
they are very brief and the actual control options are nowhere as near detailed as games released years ago
i wouldnt bother with this one unless youre an avid online gamerthe one good thing i gave to say is that the evil campaigns storyline is pretty cool
you get to play out an alternate lord of the rings where everything goes very wrong for the good guys
who hasnt wanted to smack a hobitfirst off the strategic level war of the ring is total crap
very simplistic and not very playable
again there are two prescripted campaigns good and evil
those are ok
but you dont have the option of picking your next battle by moving on a strategic map like in volume i no real improvements in design or playability just new races and units
i had expected morenot recommendedreviewed for big boss games by timmonster hunter freedomby capcomsystem playstation portable  pspthe story intro taken from the instruction book what storystory the story in this game is very weak
you must take a job assignment to kill gather or trap a monster
you get to carve any animals that you kill farm for more items to use to make a new item and repeat over and over and over till you toss your psp into a wallsound the sound in the game is good the music changes tempo when you are near a strong monster
this feature helps to keep you on the edge while trying to hunt down your target
the music also gives warning when to run from an ultra tough monstergraphics the graphics are in d
the game truly looks goodgameplay working as a team ad hocinfrastructure and hunting down a tough monster is tons of fun
when playing solo this game is not as great and at times a bit tiresome and tediousreplay value this is where this game shines
it supports up to  players in link mode allowing up to  players to join in on a hunt at one time
working as a team can make the most boring hunt funoverall this is a soso game
only the monster hunter fans from the ps game are going to love this game
i did like the multiplayer aspect of the game
it lacked story and that is one of the major reasons why i play videogames
oh and dont forget to carve
carve
carvethis game is way too hard and i wouldnt recommend it to someone who doesnt have hours to invest on it
the beasts are really hard to kill in this game from the start
i felt that it would have been better to have easier prays at the beginning
its just too hard and too time consuming to make any progress in this game
that made this game not worth playing for me since i realized it would take too much of my time to make a great hunter here
the graphics are not so bad for the time this was released but they are not so good for  the other thing i disliked about this game is that there is not an option for your hunter to be the fast type
at least not from the beginning and im used to use fast characters whenever i have the option and some beasts run away instead of fighting
i said that they are hard to kill so the smarter choice is to look for the ones that are not so strong right
the ones that might take some time to kill but are not as dangerous
well they always run away in this game
is it not logical
yes it is but stillits a game the loading times on this game are also long even on the psp there are two types of men in this world
there are men who like girls with a little class girls who have a grace and elegance as well as some sense of intelligence
then there are men who just dont care
these men would prefer their women to get down and dirty and would sacrifice iq for a bra size in the snap of a finger
in this sense the former men are playing tecmos dead or alive  the latter are going to want to play rumble roses xx insteadi must say that ive never laid hands on openly sexual or perverted games like leisure suit larry magna cum laude playboy mansion or even the original rumble roses on the playstation  rumble roses xx didnt break the sexual game ice for meit shattered it
it is a game of fetishes a place where the sexually intrigued or frustrated can enjoy watching cowgirls sm slaves and school girls bitchslap each other into submissionthis disturbing and extremely shallow premise doesnt make for much of a story and it seems to me that both yukes and konami preferred to focus on watching rather than playing because rumble roses xx is a disaster
none of the dozenplus roses control well and while wrestling games are almost always slightly sluggish rumble roses xx is painful by direct comparison
yukes prior to creating this total lack of class made a wrestling game that even i enjoyedwwe smackdown vs raw and it was extremely entertaining
the controls were much better and the reversal system that worked so well in wwe smackdown vs raw  is shot dead and butchered by rumble roses xx
on top of it all each rose has only a handful of striking moves and grapples few of which are very interesting or flashyits surprising to me even after playing rumble roses xx and swearing at the television that a game featuring sweaty men in tights is much better than a game featuring more panty shots than a years subscription to maximrumble roses xx only features a few different game modes and nothing pounds the trashy button like the humiliation mode
in this mode the loser of each match is forced to suffer through some sort of embarrassing event
the events range from tickle sessions to embarrassing poses
whichever one is preferred can be chosen at the beginning of each match and only an embarrassment meter and time limit stand between the player and a ridiculous display of virtual pixilated girlongirl play
of course there are traditional modes like tag team and battle royale for the few who will play this game for the actual wrestlingwhat might be the only real good quality about rumble roses xx are the character models
though theyre pretty similar in battle the characters all display a different sort of fetish and they animate perfectly
from an art sense theyre very interesting and respectably detailed
most of the characters are proportionally correct and traditionalists will be happy to know that there are some stars in this game whose bra size stays in the lower twelfth of the alphabet
its too bad that the girls are displayed in such a trashy fashion because a few of the characters namely the cover girl reiko are less trashy than eyebrowraisers like candy cane and miss spencer
also anything else that could be considered a visual oddity is lowquality the backgrounds and crowds surrounding the fights are boring and sometimes ugly the menus are confusing and almost randomly organized and the animation is stiff and jumpysometimes youll see characters initiate grapple moves from several feet away and clotheslines simply dont look rightim pretty disgusted that rumble roses xx is such a trashy fighting game because the dead or alive series has already proven that its possible to be sexy in video games without losing all traces of professionalism and decency
even more unfortunate is that the game actually plays so badly especially when yukes has had such an extensive a history of highquality grappling projects
if youre looking for a quality xbox  fighting game look in tecmos direction
i cant say that rumble roses xx isnt entertainingat least its possible to laugh at the outright indecency of the actionbut its not worth  and its not worth your timehonestly the game didnt really had much direction
the game starts with just with map with multiple places where you choose to fight and the locker room where the characters can wear different outfits and thats ittheres no storyline at all and you have no idea who these characters are and theres no explanation on how to play the gamei am a fan of the first rumble roses mainly because i did not take it seriously and i used to watch glow glamorous ladies of wrestling for you youngsters but this  game did not make any improvements from the last worth paying more than  bucks for
namely the content isnt pushing the envelope so to speak
there are episodes of benny hill that are more mature than this game
if you are going to make a game designed for mature themes at least make it mature and not some contrived doa ripoff
second the only way to unlock outfits is to keep playing match after dull and uninspired match
using the same moves from the first title
save your money folkswhen video game companies change developers midstream on a franchise you can only expect bad things see call of duty not unlike how john gruden wanted to make the tampa bay buccaneers his team apart from dungees bucssecondparty developers look to stake their own claimraise their own flag on a successful game franchiseand more often than notgamers pay the pricethis game was helmed by ubi soft shanghaiand man does it suck more than an overcrowded chinese subway
they tried to add a free will aspect which doesnt give you free will at all but instead gives you timed missions and added pointless stress that doesnt make the game more fun to play but likens it unto getting a root canalsure the graphics are greatbut i think in the four days since its release playstation  owners can tell you that in this day and ageand when it comes to gamesbeauty aint everythingregardless avoid this game if youre a fan of the other splinter cell titles
rent it if you havent picked one up before
all in all though this is a bigger balldrop than halo  ever dreamt of beingghost recon and rainbow six are some of the best games out there  this game isnt like those at all
im not doing a direct comparison but for those that are looking for more along those lines this isnt it
and even review this game by itself it wasnt that goodfunthe storyline intrigueing as it might be is simply overcome by slow and laggy controls bad camera poor framerates the action simply is not smoothyou find yourself missing takedowns because of graphical slowdowns and input lagthe story is tight but the actual technical product sucksit feels like they made this game for a more powerful machine and the  is struggling to run itdi am able to get online with the wii using this device but it is very touchy
my connection comes and goes seemingly at will
maybe im doing something wrong but i would not recommend this product if youre using the wii and not the ds
and yes i have disabled the firewall and my regular internet connection works beautifully so that is not the problemkonamis famous beatmania series hits the us playstation  in all the wrong ways possible
beatmania offeres the worst of both worlds as the classic beatmania djing gameplay is mixed with the worst songs in the series
a mixture of old and really old beatmania tracks give the poor impression on the average american gamer whose oblivious to the series
instead of konami aiming this game as a club style game like what they do with ddr they should have ported a modern japanese release with all the trippy music and anime which appeals to so many americans
get this bundle for the controller and import japanese beatmania games insteadthis game was ok but it was no where near as good as ddr
i liked the fact i could dance to my own music but the dances are not fun you have ti make them for it to be fun and it can be hard to make themi really like how you can dance to the music you choose
this is a huge plusi have to agree with the other reviewers
what is with the arrows
i am really good at other ddr games but i cant seem to quite catch the arrows at the right time
it tells me i have a lot of perfects but i cant figure out where the right timing isthe beat and tempo of the steps is odd too
like theres  beats to a measure or somethingits also difficult to figure out whether there are two arrows on the same line or if they just want you to him em really fast
if you play this game on a large tv ours is  inches you may never be able to tell with certainty
and the arrows are spaced far enough apart from side to side that you have to use crazy peripheral vision to catch all thats going onits still a fun game though
for the price id recommend itblazing angels squadrons of wwii looks like fun but in reality it isnt
its just a little blah and seems like its missing something to give it that extra something
the graphics at times are very good
being an xbox  game it should look good but some things in the game look pretty bad
major monuments usually look stunning which is a good idea because they are going to stand out
other things however like random buildings tanks and such look like crap
lets just say they would even look bad as an original xbox game
they just lack detail and design to give them realism
you could be flying around and be like hey look there its a cardboard boxwait thats a tank
now overall the good graphics outweigh the bad
at times it seems like by not much but overall the graphics are good
water usually looks good and so does smoke
again however when things explode etc
there isnt much detail involved
when a plane goes down for example it like catches on fire and makes its way to the ground
these types of things could have been amazing and detailed and would have really added something to the gameanother thing that seemed pretty unrealistic about the game was the ability to call the mechanic joe for advice when your plane was on fire or damaged in any way
now once or twice would be fine but you can pretty much use this option whenever you want to
you just have to wait for this little meter to fill up after every time you call on him
hell look in his owners manual and tell you what the problem is and then  buttons will be prompted on screen for you to push
once completed youre magically healed
i dont know but this just seemed a bit out there and very unrealistic
i in no way feel this function is useless because you will find yourself in need of repair at times
but the fact that you can pretty much use this ability anytime you want is a bit dumboverall this game was just ok its not my type of game and is definitely a rent for someone who just wants to try it out and see how it is
now there will be those people that think the game is awesome and love it to death
i for one am not one of these peopleunless youre a huge fan of ww planes dont get this i dont know what happened but if they spent some more time on this it couldve been decentbut they didnt from the begining it looks like they rushed this into production i meen you can see the game drawing the lines while youre flying around its pretty distracting and the gameplay and story line is just as bad n fact its so bad i dont even want to write any more about itthis best thing i can say about this game is that the graphics look good
you really get the feeling of flying as you cruise along in the simulated ww fighter planes depicted in the gamethe realism ends there
shooting down enemy planes which is supposedly next to impossible in real combat is amazingly easy in this game
the enemy planes are easy to find in the sky and a few well placed bursts send them crashing to the groundyou dont need to read up on real ww fighter tactics such as the rolling scissor to shoot down enemy planes
they wont work in this game
i tried them
the enemy planes are not visible when they are not in front of you
you do not have the nearly  degree vision of real pilots
you view the sky through your television screen and your field of vision is very limited
normally the first clue you get that an enemy is on your tail is when your plane gets shotthe only real challenging dog fights are against enemy aces
each scenario seems to have one which is prominently announced as they make a grandiose appearance
these planes require advanced flying manuvers to shoot down and seem to absorb more hits than the standard grunt planes but i was able to shoot down every one i have gone up against so far without having to do anything too complicated
basically you get on their tail and stay on it with guns blazing anytime they line up in your sights
you do have to lead your shots for turning aircraft just like in real lifeduring the battle of britain one of the most epic air battles of all time shooting down german fighters is easy
you have to mow down about forty of them just to complete the level
keep in mind to become an ace in the real airforce you have to shoot down five planes
this is considered an amazing feat only accomplished by a few highly skilled and or extremely lucky pilotsone mission which i found extremely frustrating and irritating was one in which my plane was unarmed and i was ordered to photograph three enemy bases in a desert during a severe sandstormthis mission is just plain dumb
first of all how is a photograph going to tell anyone where the enemy base is
it seems that the makers of this game think that the compass was not yet invented because your plane is not equipped with one christopher columbus probably had one of these high tech wonders
you wander the desert aimlessly unable to discern what is familiar territory and what is unexplored
i found myself just making random turns as i got more and more irritated with this missionthen miraculously you take your last photograph and you have to make a b line for your aircraft carrier
the only problem with that is that you have no idea what direction it is in the compass wouldve come in real handy here guys
you can barely even see the sun which only appears briefly during very rare gaps in the clouds
the enemy fighters which have been scrambled to shoot you down do not seem to have any visual problems in the sandstorm
they blast machineguns at you the entire time you neander in your unarmed surveilance planemaybe in a few days ill cool down enough to try this mission again but so far ive spent two hours trying to complete it only to be shot down again and again
i had to start over again because i ran out of time right as the mission was saved at the waypointi hope the sequel is more fun than this one but im not going to buy it
i might rent it but i seriously doubt it
life is too short to play irritating ill concieved games like this onenot as fun as i originally thought it would be 
glad i didnt buy it 
i love jet games which i mostly play on my pc
i rented this for my  and im glad i did before i bought it 
some may like it some may not its not a bad game just not fitting what im use to on pci want to like this game
the actual game play is enjoyable and would place the game in the company of games like tom clancys hawx
there is a certain top gun feeling to the game that would make it an enjoyable entry into airplane game genre
however the game is kind of buggy
the achievements are standard beat a level get an achievement
unfortunately getting the achievement seems to freeze the gamesystem and requires restarting the system and frustratingly replaying the level the achievement will be saved but the finished level will not be so the next time you beat you beat the level you can proceed without issue
so i played a few levels and would like to play more but until they patch this game there are other airplane games that dont offer the headachewe like more challenging games and this seemed to be more for younger players
we rated this lower because of what we like in a gamewhen i was told i could have this game i was pumped
when i loaded the game and saved my data it took  kb for rosters profile and dynasty
that and it was hard to play without setting everything good and taking about  kb
the only way to set the ball in the strike zone is to try and pitch it high
my way of hitting is to just swing and see what happens
hitting was fairly easy and playing on easy i was losing  in the rd
my favorite part of the game is to hit batters with fastballs
so overall  over  things that ruin mlb  poor graphics
very bland all around
the players all look the same
the createaplayer feature is just about as generic as you can get
the crowd is made of  or  nintendo quality models that all move and clap at the exact same time
the stadiums are all pretty eh
theyve got the basic look down but the detail is nowhere to be found
buggy graphics and sound the umpires are constantly facing the wrong direction the commentary which boasts more than  lines of dialog is ultra repetative and frequently doesnt match the gameplay fair balls are called foul youll hit a home run and the ball with go through the score board instead of bouncing off it i could go on for hours
poor gameplay the pitching system sucks
the ease of throwing a wild pitch is unrealistic and extremely frustrating
it seems like the batters hit the ball to the same  or  places every time  of the balls that hit the ground near the warning track bounce over the wall causing a ground rule double
apparently theyre playing with tennis balls
if you get caught in a rundown it is impossible to get back to your base as the defense runs  or  times faster than you regardless of the actual speed of your player
again i could go on for hours
long load times before and after each game played is between  and  minutes of load time
saving your progress takes roughly  minutes
loading your progress about a minute and a half
maybe not extremely annoying if youre playing full games with all the cut scenes but when you play in fast mode where games take  minutes its an extremely high annoyance
useless career tools of all the options youre given in terms of furthering your career  are useful
the other  not so much unless your goal is be the most hated man in baseball
i really dont understand why youre even given the chance to complain about your teammates
it really accomplishes nothing
some tools like asking your mgr
for more play time frequently give you puzzling responses
i was batting over  with  hrs   stolen bases in  games and was told i was being bumped up in the line up only because someone else wasnt performing not because i earned it
seriouslypros  copied many concepts from mvp  such as hotcold zones pitching meter anologue stick power
espn like replay quality with the two teams playing each other shown
good broadcastingcons  a clone copy of the two other games from last year
poor graphics
limited announcing phrases
wasnt having nearly as much fun as with usual video gamesoverall this game had more negatives than positives
i liked last years version betterim not here to really say anything about bofiii in generali recently replayed the ps version and the game has held up wonderfully over the years so i wanted to grab the psp version to add to my collection of other ps to psp ports because everyone knows the psp is portremake city
however despite sonys terrible decision not to release this and mega man legends  in the states we apparently need a sixth version of ffiv but a second version of bofiii is a nogo this definitely deserved another release
dont even get me started on my feelings towards squareenix anymoreim here about the nondata physical quality of this product
the copy of bofiii i got what i assume is the europeans version of the greatest hits label made me laugh with its quality
i know they cut corners on reprints actually i try and avoid greatest hits versions of anything because of that and it was stupid of me to buy this blind ill have to go on ebay and get an original print but we cant even put the umd logo on the umd
the absolutely destroyed case which wasnt a shipping issue as the fragments would have been there inside the wrapping was also a nice bonus
really if i didnt know any better id say it almost smells of bootleg
cant even have the bofiii logo on the freakin disc
looks like someone with a basic computer just typed breath of fire iii
yeah im a little bit of a diva when it comes to my video games and my standards are high ok very high but theyre my standards to have
anyways great game if you havent played it you should give it a whirl but i need to quit buying games where i cant see a picture of the exact copy im gettingthis is not really a game
you dont have a goal youre trying to achieving and youre definitely not tryng to break any records
youre supposed to groove to the music that you and the electroplanktons are making together
i bought this because i thought i could make interesting music with it while im away from my piano butits much more simplistic and in my opnion its for people who dont have any musical background at all
i found it unfun and actually frustrating because it seems im just peicing preprogrammed sound bytes together and not really creating anything truly my own
alas
oh but the graphics are super cutei dont like the mad katz brand
they seem  have problems with compatibility specially in the gamesharks
datels products are much better in my opinion
if you want a good ps cheat device get a codebreaker
they went outta business so youll have to look on amazon or somewhere like that for  of those
code twink is available for codebreaker codes if you need any
datel still has action replay
maybe thatll be a good substitute if you cant find a codebreaker
hope this was helpfulthey need age groups for ds games because this game is hard she wanted this bad and she gets frustrated she cant figure it out and hell eiother can i it is hard but being the princess instead of mario is a good changei have to be honest i love tales of phantasia but the game boy advance iteration of the game was a major disappointment
the music was roughly the same as good as it could be for the console but the gameplay took a serious hit when ported to the gba
if you are going to play this game find the downloadable super famicom version or get the psx version
both of those are much betterwith an extremely clunky unresponsive battlesystem and one of the poorest paced and written stories i have seen this game should not be nearly as revered as it is by its fanbasei think that this was an alright game
i know the graphics were a lot better on the psp versiob than the previous versions of tales of phantasiain the psp version i know that they have added some new content and some new skits
but the game boy game is still a lot of fun
some of the game characters were pretty funnythe battle system was kind of difficult a little to handle
i didnt really like how the battle system was like
other tales game seem to have much better battle systemsoverall i really liked the story that the game had and the characters each had their own personalities and goodbad qualities
just like in the other tales gamesthe animation scenes were not very graphical but as it was for the game boy they did a nice clean job so farat the end of the game after beating the game there is a gradeshop so that you can play the game over again with more added stuff you can buy in the gradeshop like the other tales games haveyou can play the game on a harder difficulty and it will make it a more challenging game the second time you play it
overall i give this game a  because of its great story and the characters i like
the battle system was ok like i stated before but its not as good comparing to the other tales games
especially ones for the other consoles
but its a great d gamethis is the gba verison and not psp or playstation
this game by its old graphics and poor redone voiceacting is not worth the price
the playstationpsp version has better voiceacting cutscenes and the graphics are much better
that version also has the option of listening to the game sounds in a radio feature
this is a cheap redone version without any of the original or additional features
the graphics are a cheap mixture between ps and snes
the battle sprites the shape of the snes but the dumped colors of the psas far as pricing goes it is a ripoff
this game can be brought at a much cheaper price but why buy this when the playstation version is better
i literally brought this game used for  bucks
plus oftentimes the game will slow down during battle even playing on a ds lite
not to mention the annoying crayola brightlight graphics
the original is superb in the smoothness of the fighting
why has the gba been released as though the original game was a slowdown is a mysteryit is highly suggested to get the original game for snes or the psp port
avoid this rushed poorly redone version of a good franchisecc games are old and primitive
much better rts games are available today
recommendedcodename panzerswar frontcompany of heroesrise of legendsww black golddawn of warworld in conflictground control universe at warsoldiers heroes of wwsword of the starsact of warsteel soldiersall available on amazon if you liked this review feel free to click my name and check out my othersi have played the first onimusha game from start to finish
you can check my other reviews to see what i thought of that one
i was hoping that three sequels later they would have fixed the glaring flaws in what would otherwise exemplify some of the prettiest graphics for the ps console
they fixed only one of the problems from the first gamefirst of all my biggest complaint has got to be the play control or the lack of it
sure they fixed the tank controls so at least you dont have to rotate your character before making them walk forward
but its still just a boring button masher
what fun is a game when you can practically close your eyes and just tap the x button repeatedly and win a great deal of the battlesduring the battles where a little more finesse and variation is required i found the controls to be sticky and delayed to an annoying degree
also considering that this is a game where the hero has a few different swords he can play with i was really annoyed that there was not quick way to switch back and forth
you have to press start and go through a menu system to select a different sword
what a stupid way to interface weapon selection in a combat game
if it had been an rpg menus wouldnt matter as much but in a hack n slash
come on guys try a little
i also have a personal beef that they choose not to add platforming
seriously now this is a game where we see the hero or other ancillary characters display superhuman feats of speed strength and agility and you mean to tell me they cant hop a threefoot break between two rooftops or hop up just one friggin foot to reach a stepladder that had the bottom blown off
its just lazy game designso lets get to the story
its based loosely on japanese lore and myth about warring factions in feudal japan but enhanced with mysticism and armies of demons and zombies
its also a highly convoluted story
its also full of cheesy dialogue and campy voiceovers that youd expect from most average anime features
i suppose that for many people that might be reason enough to get the game but its not a preference for me
take that for what its worth you very well might like it
theres also the token onimusha trend of having peoples diaries and random books of myth scattered about in the game to add detail to the worlds setting and atmosphere
to me this is a copout to avoid cinematic storytelling
then again some of the journals really add nothing and only serve to further water down the game
i felt like id wasted time just picking them up and reading themill be  honest with you and openly state that i did not play this game from start to finish
i played it for about  hours and then took the disc out to return to my brother whom i borrowed it from
other than pretty graphics this game offers me nothing worth investing hours of my time into
i rarely get flat out bored playing a game and this game managed to do itconsidering that my brother loves this game and hes an adult as well i suppose that means that there are people out there that this game was made for
people who are probably not diehard gamers and who like really simple gameplay impressive graphics and cheesy anime storylines
well heres your game folks
im honestly glad to know somebody enjoys the effort they put forththis game have good graphics good sound good playability but this game is the worst in the onimusha series try a rentalthis game is simply and solely an attempt to be call of duty
when will people realize that the cod series is the only truly good ww game series out there
this game can be a decent amount of fun but it comes across as an underfunded counterstrike clone with different graphics
well if i wanted to play cs id play cs
the weapons control isnt that greatand to top it off heres the worst part of this game  i went on recently and all the servers had a bunch of people in them
you know what they were
if you guessed bots youre wrong
they were fake people
thats right the morons running all the dod servers put fake names in their players list when the server is completely empty so that people will go to their server
of course then they see no one is truly in there and leave anyway so it doesnt even work
is this the most idiotic thing youve ever heard or what
one last complaint  where does steam get off charging all this money for these mediocre games and they dont even let you play a demo of them first
what the hell
ive never been pleased with a game bought on steamthis could be a good game if there was a way to play it other than online
unfortunately the description of the game doesnt tell you that thats the only way it worksthis game has so much potential and seems like it would be very good in a wide variety of ways
however it uses the steam authentication engine and steam does not work
i have installed and reinstalled this game about  times and the thing has wasted so much of my time i can not begin to tell you how frustrated i am
my other games work fine even those with internet verfication
do not buy this game or any game that relies on the steam network
hopefully the game producers will get the message that the game consumers will not put up with thispros nice models and graphics love the fire smooth game love dog good story fun to play not to hard and not to easycons too short for the money i felt cheated hated the ending first hour is just walking around with the gavity gun boring  is cut scenes same characters same weapons nothing new nothing fresh what happened to dog in the end
this game just felt too short for the cost of the game
i bought it saturday night to play on fathers day and i finished it before fathers day arrivedwe have dialup internet we live in africa and if you have to connect to this stupid steam program before you play the gameits hardly worth it
after a couple of days of downloading the steam updatesthen the game updatesi almost lost interest
unfortunately its a pretty fun game after all of that but ill never buy another game that requires a broadband internet connection to play it
if a dvd game isnt patched well enough to play out of the boxkeep it off the marketwell i played the nonsteam version so this isnt a review including steam which has put me off valve forever
never again will i wait for steam to update itself every single time i load up the game neveras for episode onegraphics it is admittedly starting to look dated
graphically it doesnt compete with the latest games fear oblivion or even tomb raider for goodness sakes but nevertheless it is better still than average
the halflife engine is still the best at creating facial characters at least visavis oblivion though this seldom matters
the textures particularly when you are close up are very dated compared to modern games but the water still shines in its subtle way
you still feel like you are in a hovercraft as there is no real sense of moving properly or stepping  you are simply sliding around no real sense of proper movement you cast no shadows and have no legs you are basically riding a railsound superb
this is where the game really shines
great sound effects and the music maintains the momentum of the scene in question to aid in the atmosphereai half life  was a step down in this department from half life  and this is still the case here
there are no tough opponents in this game and no clever tactics to defeat you that were present in the half life  and its brilliant sequel opposing force
much better things to be found elsewherestory telling
this is where valve has traditionally shined
the original half life was a masterpiece in this area
more recent games such as fear and farcry borrowed heavily from half life  and in some areas expanded on it
half life  though despite some brilliant set pieces was a step backward in this area from the original
episode  does nothing to bring back the atmosphere from half life  and does not offer and real answers to the questions being raised
when half life  was released i was working in the gaming industy
the game was hyped to the unbelievable and i bought it on the first day
after a week none of the gamers talked about it again as everyone had moved on to games with some substance
nothing will change with episode value for money you are better off waiting for the fear expansion pack or playing oblivion if for some reason you havent discovered it as yet
episode  simply doesnt offer a reasonable enough experience for the money
with so many new things just around the corner think crysis it is difficult to justify a purchase herei just won halflife  episode one on hard difficulty
i realize that its considered an expansion even though it is a standalone product but for the price i think i should get more than a partial evenings worth of entertainment out of it
total play time a little under four hoursthe good is more difficult than the original hl
 of the game is spent battling endless hordes of zombies and antlions and soldiers
 looks beautiful  excellent scenery and atmospherethe bad short
this is nothing more than a playable demo  an expanded lost coast
 plot
play the original hl or to a lesser extent the original hl if you want plot
hle is pure shooter
 a majority of the game is horrible escort missions
protect alyx  if she dies you lose
protect the citizens  if they die you lose
escort missions
argh
 runs poorly on my machine
even with accepting the recommended settings for my system which are less than what i currently have the original hl set to it runs at half the speedthe ugly level design is far less linear and intuitive than the original hl
sometimes this is a good thing as it adds another dimension to the game but after a while it gets annoying when the primary goal of the whole game becomes solving tedious navigation puzzles
 one new monster two if you count the stalkers which you see but never actually get to engage in hl but no new weapons in fact you get less weapons in hle than in the original hlanyone who enjoyed the original halflife  will get this game anyways regardless of good or bad reviews
id say that if youre casually looking around for a game you could easily find one with a far better fun to cost ratioi exspected a good game and i got a good game
what ruined the moment is that the game ended way too soon and the steam setup which is like a spyware on my pc
i did not like the fact i had to wait several hours to do the episode one download when i already went to the store and bought the game itselfi know steam is paranoid about theft but this system of theirs is idioticstill a good game despite the obvious flawshalflife  episode onehere is a transcript of my interview with valve softwares new scuritypublic relations director mr knute caseme hello mr case can i call you knuteknute case sure hackerme what
why am i a hackerknute well here at valve all users are guilty of hacking until proven not so guilty its our policyme oh that explains steam
well lets talk about the new game halflife  episode one
when i finally got to play the game it was great butknute wait a minute you figured out how to install it
you are a hackerme no i just realized that i had to uninstall all the steam software that was already running on my pc firstknute let me guess you installed steam where you wanted not the default locationme yeah well it is my pc after all
anyway i was able to install steam then i reinstalled halflife  then this gameknute but you still had to download the actual game the dvd just contains just a few pieces of episode  it may be your pc but the game will never really be yours hahahaha
so hacker were you able to download and decrypt the gameme yes i was eventually but it took a while
i still resent having to log onto a web server to play a single player game this seems kind of crazy
and what about giving us gamers some clear instructionsknute next youll be asking to be treated like a customer
clear installation instructions would be like giving you hackers free access to the source code
that is why we bury the episode one executable in a hidden folder deep inside your pcme knute the game also crashed a lot many graphical glitchesknute thats a new game feature we call suckervision we updatedfixed that feature in episode two
want to guess at how to get this patch now
i cant tell you directly but here is a cluejhusyoweokfjcnciej    me ill pass
also the game is awfully shortknute we here at valve have determined that selling a game in  short parts for twenty bucks a piece is better than selling a game in  parts for  bucks each
but we pass that savings on to the consumerme really
howknute we will be bundling the next chapter of halflife  with a free retina scanner and a dna sampler
this technology will make the game more secure and funfunfunme sounds awful
is there any way to play this single player game offline
i just want a few hours of fun minus the aggravationknute yes but that would be telling harharhar
seriously that will never happen  its valves game not yoursloved hl but that was when steam was only mildly annoying
now the steam activation system has reached a whole new level of sadistic pain
i wont rehash whats been described below but suffice to say it takes longer to activate this game than play it
the game hl ep  is ok but nothing new but hey who wouldnt rather spend  hrs trying to activate the game ala steam than play it
i think ill pass on hl ep  until valve comes to their senses
in the meantime if i want to frustrate myself ill go back to trying to purge my system of all the starforce subroutines i can only imagine what steam has bugged my system withcons graphically not that impressive
achievements that arent really that easy
halflife style vehicle driving but worse
repetitive gameplay
shoot a helicopter a million times and it wont die unless the game agrees its the helicopters time to go
far too easy to get killed a million times by someonesomething you cant even see
 steps to the left the screen fills with red and youre dead instantly  why
what killed me
oh it was a sniper i cant even see in the dark again for the th time
better checkpoints could have helped that but no luck so youll be repeating the same stupid thing over and over and over and over and over again
really no different than any other average shooter out therepros the disc spins in the tray
the game loads and workslook at the rating i got it and then returned it and exchanged it for call of duty  much much betteri only bought this because i really like racing games and there just isnt much out there for the  i shouldnt have not much to add that hasnt been said in previous posts just wanted to get my rating in and hopefully save someone else great graphics yes
gameplay bites
in addition to bug mentioned in other reviews it is very difficult to control your bike
i mean somebody greased the track with shortening difficulti played the free demo and admittedly it was tolerable
what do you expect from a prerelease demo right
then motogp hit the shelves and thankfully i rented this title for  days i played it for  day and it collected dust on my shelf the other  days i think at one point i actually decided to mow my lawn insteadvery disappointed with this lackluster effort in gameplayi own all three fight nights and they almost seem to digress
i loved the first one but i hated the announcer so having a fairly sophisticated announcer in the round  was a welcomed changeall of the upgrades in round  are disappointing
sometimes you swing and miss and your boxer is just frozen there to be punched for  seconds i dont know what is with that
before some of the fights you have to weigh in
fights break out but you can not punch so it just becomes a chance to block while your opponent drills you
the announcer says the same thing every fightwhen it comes down to it round  is still a good game but it is not quite as good as the first two fight nights
the graphics for round  on  are incredible but they are no better than round  if you do not have a  save your money until you dothis game simply fails to offer the richness of play of the gta series
in driver the buildings are simply scenery to drive around boxes painted with textures
add to that some very dodgy vehicle handling and traffic that edges around dumbly at snail speeds and you have a major problem suspending disbelief and getting into the game
i got bored with it about half way through and gave upafter playing this in the store i dont get it
you move the heads around untill you have matched four of a pokemons head in a row
i wated about  minuits of my life playing this game and i did not enjoy it
ever since pokemon dash these games are going down the market kids now like sonic and mario and are big sellers
dont buy unlees you want a pointless gamethis game is entertaining enough
however it doesnt have the best playback value and gets old pretty quickly
first of all i dont like the new graphic style of the game
when i turned it on the first thing i thought of was dexters laboratory
it has a very cartoonish americanstyle cartoon look to it and doesnt feel like a pokemon game at all
second whats with that story
you play as some girl who is a secret agent out to get people who are trying to steal pokemonprobably the dumbest thing pokemon has done sincewell since forever
since when does the world of pokemon have secret agents
it just doesnt seem to go wellthe gameplay is pretty fun
i love puzzle games and this one is challenging and it makes you think
you control rows and colums of pokemon that fall from the top of the screen one by one entire rows dont fall at once pokemon do and try to match them up
this is a lot like tetris attack in some respects except you move the entire row or column instead of switching individual places
you have to try to clear the screen of all pokemon
you control the pokemon from the touch screen but the top screen is also part of the level
if the top screen fills all the way up you lose
dittos are wild and there are rare pokemon that only appear in the levels every so often some of which disappear quickly if you dont combo them right away
since you have a pokedex the rare ones go into that collectionim not really a fan of the newschool pokemon  i liked it better when there were  of them and they were more creative come on what the heck is pineco
that gives me a bias against the new games to begin with
however as a puzzle game this game is really not all that creative
its fun for a few days and then it gets boring
you fight different bosses and collect pokemon for your pokedex
its fun but this is nothing new
check it out if you find it for a good price but otherwise there are much better ds games out thereive been with the wild arms series from the ground floor
the first game was very nice for its time with numerous extras an interesting story and an excellent quickpaced battle system
the second game was incredible with a search option built in an number of extras and a great story which was unfortunately marred by a translation which ceased to make sense on the nd disc in fact it literally makes no sense at times
the first ps offering wa was a very nice game
although the graphics werent great i liked the idea of celshading and the game itself was very fun and long
the remake of wa alter codef was a disaster of course but nevermind about thatnow this brings us to wa
i bought this game immediately upon release but for whatever reason i never played it
now i know why  this game is badtomediocre at bestlets begin with the story the cornerstone of any rpg
boring
unnecessary
insipid
these are words that come to mind
i dont mind that a game doesnt continue in the exact same fashion as its predecessors in fact with the sole exception of the suikoden series this is generally a sign of a decaying franshise but there is absolutely nothing interesting in this latest story set on filgaia
the game itself clocks in at about  hours less if you can make good use of lucky cards and the like and most of it is a dungeoncrawl
there are about  towns total in the game and you get absolutely nothing from speaking with townspeople
nothing
they dont add to the story  in fact their ramblings often make zero sense in the game itself
i wont spoil the story but it essentially steals from wa in a bad way and has absolutely nothing that will make you want to play on other than the desire to get through this stinkergraphics
not as important in an rpg and actually i kind of like the graphics here
the outlines of the celshaded characters have disappeared but this shouldnt come as a surprise  its been years since the last wa game was released
there is little to distinguish the graphics of this game from its predecessor other than that cited above however and the game lacks the ability to move the camera which is an annoyance when trying to spot treasure chests and by the way there are only  chests in this game far less than the last offering
this isnt surprising since there are fewer dungeons and towns in this game than in the last onegameplay
its a disaster
dungeons are long and boring and make up the majority of the game
the puzzles are easy but annoying requiring long outoftheway trips to obtain tools to light torches or the like
there is one light here  i love the option of turning off encounters when you fulfill certain conditions
it doesnt really make the game more fun but its an innovation i would like to see in more rpgs down the linebattle the hex system is a great idea that isnt utilized in any way shape or form
boss battles tend to be ridiculously easy cast slow down and lock and you wont lose and regular battles are either easy or cheap basically if the computer gets to take  turns before your characters youre gonna feel pain
otherwise youre in the clear
the strategy aspect is there but it is rarely necessary
one of the final battles is a nightmare however but thats ok  theres nothing that would prepare you for it anywayextras totally drops the ball in this regard
the arena has turned into a lot of tedious single battles all of which cost money and none of which give you any feeling of accomplishment
the sheriffs star the best badge in the game is an exercise in tedium  it take millenia to obtain the necessary ingredients and the rewards are meager ok you are now the strongest character in existence
the regular game bosses are still a joke and angolmois is still a nightmare
there are a few sealed monsters as in all the series but now it is an incredible pain to open their seals often requiring a ridiculous amount of backtracking because you lost the tool necessary to open the seal
i find it to me more ordeal than fun challengethere are also a few bugs in the game
it is impossible to find every monster in the game  some of them were removed from gameplay yet were not removed from the monster list
thats unacceptablei fear wa may be the last in the series
if so thats too bad  a great series has been marred by two terrible outings
i give the game two stars overall because in the hands of better developers there are some excellent innovations here that could really make for some interesting gameplayive read some of the other reviews here  i have no idea what everyone else sees in this gameafter really enjoying alter codef i was excited to see wa come out
too bad it didnt begin to live up to expectations
heres the bad uneven character development uninteresting story line the fighting system needs polishing potential here just not well refined terrible voiceovers there is a feature to shut them off  use it the game got rid of its old tool system for puzzle solving and added something that seemed like it was out a mario brothers side scrolling game
ok  not that pathetic but bad nonethelessthe good
well i couldnt really find one
the story didnt excite so the game devolved into a series of very boring fights without much point
the fights themselves didnt exite either  youll wind up using the same strategies over and over again
the hex system has potential  but it seems like the idea was rushed and not well refinedi sort of felt the same with wa although that game i at least toughed it through to the end and never touched again
this one i bailed out on after  hours of game play
maybe i missed out on the good part but i kind of doubt itonward to grandia  so far  that game rocks
pick it up insteadwhy will it frustrate the living crap out of you
spells either youll mix them up or sometimes even though you draw the symbols correctly the game wont recognize it
your main character keeps rushing to the front and gets himself killedi even try moving him to the back but sometimes i gotta move them all and he eventually goes to the front
very frustrating if you die you start back in the map and when you go back to the quest you go through all the talking or whatever all over againi wish i can just restart the level and get it over with or at least give me the option to do so monsters get blocked by walls or objects
like they dont have enough brains to maneuveur themselves around stuff
they get stuck and you gotta go and move them around the object imagine doing this when ur busy fighting something or racing against the clock
i sort of hate the clock thing you always gotta rush
theres more but thats my main complaintso seriously if you have high blood pressure avoid
it has its cool addictive side but its really old school
try it out but if it pisses you off you have been warned
this game might lower the life of your ds if you know what i meani must disagree with the other reviewers
the game isnt designed for the psp the gameplay and story arent bad at all but there are very important features ubisoft dev team didnt had in their mind and they should
the psp isnt a game console with a good outdoors screen and this game should came to players with game brightness level as option and there isnt nothing that makes very hard impossible to play outside unless at night only if you use sams night vision but not always avaiable during the game
joining this with the dificult game camera movement makes the gameplay dificult
we know splinter cell relays on sams missions on the shadow but the brightness are essencial on the psp and this game dont make the psp fun to use
for that big mistake i give only  stars and i advice to try the game before you buy iti have never played any games in the sc series which i think might be part of my problem
if you have some familiarity with the series i had read that some missions in this game were taken directly from the console versions then you probably have some idea of what is going on
i found myself struggling with the awkward character movement and unclear objectives
also and this might be my fault for not reading the instructions i could not save in the middle of a level and return to that point later
when i saved and turned the game off it always started me at the beginning of the level instead of where i left offi found the game controls to be very clumsy particularly when trying to manuever sam near the edge of a cliff or dropoff
it is really easy to send him fallingas some other reviewers had pointed out the settings in this game are very dark
you will need to use the night vision goggles most of the time which gets annoyingi played syphon filter before this one and found that game to be much betterr
if you are looking for a shooter i would stay away from splinter cell and go with something else
if youre a splinter cell fan you might enjoy this game if you can get past the annoyancesthis game is not action packed its really really slow and boringthis game may be fun for kids but definitely not for a teendont waste your money on this game it looks fun but when you actually play the game its really really very very slow and boringoveralldont buy it its slow and boring for teensthe game is rather fun but i have to warn you
there are parts thatll make you want to pull your hair out in frustration
that is all that you have to know about this game is that itll make you want to pull your hair out in frustration
if you want your sanity kept in check avoid this game at all coststhe developers of this game show very well that they dont realize what actually counts in making a game fun and that part is the fact that it has to be fun
frustration only sits there to impede on this
there are numerous issues for this game and ill explain the biggest ones belowfirst and foremost some of the checkpoints wherein if you die you get ressurected to at the end of the game are nigh and far between on the tanker level the second time you go in
youll have a part wherein its literally one minute time your movement perfectly or restart then you have to jump perfectly or youll fail and have to do that along with the one minute perfect moves again
why they didnt make it so that you could go back to the jumping perfectly area again after you die is anyones guess
i personally believe its because theyre idiots who dont know good qathe next biggest issue with thsi game is the minigames
they suck plain and simple they suck
there is no ryhtm there is rhyme there is no pattern
what they do is the equivalent of button mashing the controller at random intervals
this is how they do their minigames
some of them are optional some are not
the ones that are not are the worst
the very end of the game you have one that is identical to one that youve already faced except its a million times worse
its pure button mashing with no pattern at all also no indication of progress
also like the checkpoints in this game minigames have none
and this is one of them wherein if you mess up once back to the beginning
you have to be able to handle the leftright hand of the screen top to bottom along with being able to press all  of the face buttons at any given time without any messupsalso driving any vehicle in this game is reminiscent of grand theft auto except its actually worse
and you have to repeatedly drive a vehicle to beat the game
so unless you like failing time and time again id avoid this game
if you are a glutten for punishment since the controls are horrible then by all means enjoy this gamethis game has too many flaws to call it a good game
the issue here is how they designed it and i cannot give it anything higher than  stars
if you take out the horrible minigames and fix that there are badly placed checkpoints on one of the levels and the horrible controls when piloting a vehicle then this is definately a  star game the platforming is really fun there is loads of humor and the levels are pretty well designed
but to summarize it again avoid this game unless youre really into the jak and daxter series or are a glutten for punishemtn
i know that ill never replay this game again once im done thsi time its going to sit on a shelf and colelct dust
the games not worth replaying due to its flaws which make the game feel like they had no qathis game frustrated the hell out of me
i chopped up wood and stuff for awhile and tried to make things grow but really didnt succeed
i didnt really know what to do next and wasnt enthralled with growing things or the gameplay so i quit and escorted my copy to gamestop for reselling
you can get it there my wife is not a gamer like me but there are a few games that she likes
she has always liked the harvest moon series
shes played it since the super nintendo game and shes always enjoyed ituntil nowthe graphics are great the gameplay is great the touch additions are fun at first but annoying after a while the story is good and the game is just plain funthe problem is the glitches
the game locked up on her a couple of times which wasnt the end of the world but was a major annoyance if she hadnt saved recently
then one morning after a storm all of her feed bins dissapeared
they didnt reapear
she was so frustrated knowing that her animals would die without being fed and there was no way to feed themi sold the game on ebay a few weeks after that
she didnt want to start over
from my personal experiencedont buy this gamehonestly i found this game to be kind of boring
im an adult a woman and every once and awhile i like to set back and unwind with a video game
the graphics are not that great a lot of kids would get bored with how much dialogue is in the game
when you turn it on the first  minutes is nothing but dialogue
not impressedi never made it past year two without the game crashing
after the third attempt i gave up and traded the game in for credit
if you dont own it dont buy it
its not worth the twenty bucksi like some many others loved the baldurs gate games and then loved the jump forward that was neverwinter nights
ive been waiting for this game for quite some time knowing that it would be greatexcept its not
ive played it for a few hours here and there since i bought it launch day
i normally wait to read reviews before buying any game but figured this one would have to be awesome never again will i break this rulethe graphics are ok the design is very very clunky
you never quite can get things done rapidly enough in or out of battle
too many menus
the radial design of before is far superiori think the best way to describe this game is i couldnt wait for it to arrive and now that it has it just sits taking up massive room on my pc and doesnt get played while i play superior games like gears of war final fantasy iii justice league heroes and marvel ultimate allianceone of these days ill rush through and finish just so i dont feel like someone stole  bucks from me then ill get what i can for this clunker on ebaythe game lost me at the leather biker couple who hit on your sixteen year old hero
some of the absolute worst sterotyping and poor judgement by a game studio everthats ten minutes into the gamethe first release by the former squarenix usa had utterly failed me in less time than it took to get comfy on the couch
thats a record folks
now to be fair i figured the last shawdohearts game was good and the combat system is interesting lets give it another shot
it does get better but ultimately never rises above its inauspicious beginningthe wheel of destiny combat system is still fun and makes the nowolderthandirt random encounters experience more than boring but ultimately fails to deliver what i like to call the didnt waste forty eight bucks goods
this game is sort of meh from beginning to near the end where i sort of gave up on the whole mess and took it in for tradea seriously abused and overworked storyline and characters that seem like they were added just for the weird factor dont helpif youre gonna spend fifty bucks on a ps roleplaying game check out dragon quest  or final fantasy  if youve already gotten through those check out radiata stories or magna carta
or check out the shadowhearts covenant the last installment in the shadowheart series
its far superior to this trainwreckholy crap this game is terrible
absolute garbage
what a waste of time
they should of just stuck with the first two excellent shadow hearts and let the series end on a high note there if this is what they created after those two stellar games
ugh lets get this over withgameplay  if you played the first two and you really should if you havent you know about the judgement ring
if not heres the basic rundown
when you perform an action in the game like attacking an enemy or selecting an item in battle to use a ring will appear at which time if you stop the ring in the green hit zone youll attack or use the item
if you hit the smaller red critical zone youll deal more damage or the item or magic spells effect will increase
one of the few good things about this abomination since it keeps you focused on the battle instead of just letting you sit there idly
the difficulty of this game is actually kind of high where the enemy always seems to have at least  hit point left to attack you with on their turn
if you like challenging games this might be for you
however youd probably want to steer clear for other reasonsgraphics  i like the fmv movies but the ingame graphics made my eyes bleed
the enemies are inventive though ill give em that much but the characters are especially atrocious
they all have perhaps the most stupid looking facial expressions ive seen in a character screen shot in an rpg
they look like they just guzzled down mothballs and windexstory  i really enjoyed the humor of the first two games
a lot
they were genuinely funny yet expertly blended it with likeable characters and seriousness
not this game and the whole teen rating hindering the mature humor excuse falls flat considering covenant did it well
the characters are somewhat unique but not like in shadow hearts and shadow heartscovenant where they were both unbelievable and realistic
if you played the games youll understand what i mean
it seemed here they went for quirkiness a little too muchsoundmusic  the battle theme and boss theme are badass
the other music and the voice acting is horrible though
i felt like i was listening to a really bad merging of britney spears and the worst hasbeen hard metal band comeback
even the last boss theme sucked
by the way spoiler its who you think she isdo not buy this game
buy shadow heartsshadow heartscovenant but not this
or used toothpicks
or hair scrunchies
just dont waste your time or money on this piece of horse cheers and happy gamingnot much to cover here than what everyone else saidi got a good deal on it over the weekend being that the store i went to was going out of business disks  hrs of patching  reboots and tweaking the graphics card laterthe game plays like these guys are in molassessadly enough i got a  nvidia card on my board but the game looks like something from a p iii from years ago
i am just hitting the opening chapters of the game and i am frustrated with the camerawork and combatnot really feeling this game at all
if you a hardcore player of this game by all meansif notjust avoidi have started a new game twice and gotten so bored with it that i keep discarding it and ending up playing around with the toolset
ive discovered that this game is intentionally incomplete
the maximum level in this release for a character is  the old nwn with both expansions allowed you to go to 
continual flame is included in the toolset but is completely disabled when loaded into the playable portion of the software
i guess those continual flame whiners from nwn won
i cant get keen edge or weapon of impact to function at all even though it appears that they are supposed to
there are many high level spells which appear in the toolset but simply do not function in the playable portion of the game
conversations within this release of the game strongly imply that there are more crafting recipes available than those that are outlined in the recipe books and that does appear to be the case since many recipes stop at a mere  enchantment but the game is designed to take  or  in many cases
however why would anyone go through the trouble of trying to find them when they simply may not be there or worse theyre not there now but will be there only after the release and installation of the next expansion
crafting is now a huge part of the game such that my rogue character is now pretty much worthless when it comes to having decent items
i played around with a triple classed rogueclericwizard and found that with that combination youd come close to being able to craft any of the explicitly stated recipes with that character at level  i would still need to able to go up a few more levels to get absolutely everything
also why would i want to design modules for this game that will be inherently limited because i designed them without the limitdissolving future expansions
youd be foolish to design a module now unless you have no problem with it becoming completely obsolete upon release of the next socalled expansioni still cant bash items
i can not attack and murder nonhostiles
i can get my pickpocketing detected by the victim every time i do it and there doesnt appear to be any negative consequences in the game the npcs do not react or attack you
you can not die unless your entire party is killed
i see nothing in the way of dyes to customize armor and the light gems are gone
as i said before continual flame is disabled while keen edge and weapon of impact are present but doesnt seem to function properly
greater magic weapon sort of works but it borks around with the enhancement bonus all wrong
the inventory system is still borked  no dragging and dropping into containers and has unidentifiable artwork
crafting items is essential in this game but can only be accomplished with the help of multiple level  party members
they fixed it so it is impossible for a nonmagic caster such as a rogue to craft magical items not even if youre level  with a godlike ring of crafting with items and scrolls for all the spells you need
item and scroll casts dont count towards enchanting items
also crafted items are restricted to three enchantments each though items you find in the game can and do easily have more for some reason
you cant steal from stores always hated this about the dd implementations since bg
i like the character creation and the gameplay itself is alright
performance is good if i keep shadows turned off
the world detail is good though your movements are always restricted down one single path
no exploring here
the plot is okay so far but incredibly linear
load times are ridiculously long
i really like the fact that you can have four fully fledged controllable party members though the item use behavior turned off doesnt seem to turn off item use for that character
say goodbye to all your charges on that amulet if anyone that you arent directly controlling is actually wearing it
the biggest problem i have is the intentional incompleteness of this gamei am struggling to enjoy this game right now and the fact that it was intentionally released as incomplete really makes me mad
if i had it to do over again id only consider buying it in a couple years when their platinum or diamond edition is released with all the expansionsremaining portions of the game includedoverall this is an excellent game that is still in the beta stage
therefore  please do not buy this game unless your gaming computer meets the recommended requirements  not the minimum requirements  that is almost certainly not good enough
 even if you can run the game smoothly be ready for bugs
 be sure to download all the patches either  or  beta theyre huge   go to the nwn community web site and see what kind of problems are out there there are tons of problems  some of which you surely will encounter i wont go over them because there are simply too many to list and they happen too randomly
that is the few reviewers who criticized the whiners did not experience them
on the other hand there are a lot of nonwhiners who have absolutely legitimate reasons to complain over a game that is being released at least  months too early
i hope to be fair to both groupwith that said please let me repeat that this is still an excellent game that has major issues
graphic is good but not spectacular considering the game being a resource hog
oblivion albeit being a different type of gameplay truly has spectacular graphic for the same system requirement
however we all know that games should not be based on eye candies alone but on how fun it is to play and that is nwn s saving grace
gameplay is a big improvement over nwn
you now have almost full control of up to  party members  very similar to star wars knight of the republic  from the same maker obsidian with a touch of baldurs gate gameplay thrown in but do not expect the same level of high precision of control over party members as in baldurs gate or icewind dale
but that also means that you dont have to micromanage too much so its a give and take situation
it does take a while maybe even a great while or maybe never but if you can get over the camera annoyances and come to term with it the game play can really rock as this is really a fun gamethe story is excellent though not as compelling as nwn   once you get into it it will hook you and wont let go
this is simply what obsidian does best in this game and probably all their games
there is noticeable lack of a central character that you can immediately identify as both the antagonist and a protagonist and develope a lovehate relationship with such as kreia in swkotor  or aribeth in nwn   regardless it still is great story tellingsound is also excellent but also has lot of minor setback
to begin with there are very good theme and backgrougd sound and music as well as good voice acting
the complain here is that way too much are borrowed from nwn   if you ever play swkotor  you will probably agree that the obsidian team has plenty of musical talents that does not require borrowedmusic
perhaps the problem here as well is the fact that the game is being released way too earlyas is my biggest complaint is directed at the corporate suits aka the new archangels of the new god profit that pushes this game to release before xmas all for the sake of being able to make the timely offering to their newfound god
my next complaint goes to obsidian an extremely talented team ive played all their games  ive been a gamer since the late s that has the leverage to play hard ball but instead chose to bow down or or bend over to the archangels and take it with a smilelastly i should also complain about us the gaming community that apparently are beginning to think that it is ok to produce unfinished games
please take some times to think about this
if you have a real job you would agree that there is no chance in hell that you can release an incomplete product that did not make it through quality control  and worst of all think that it is ok to do so
if you want to be more precise then heres one a game should easily run with the stated minimum requirement printed on the box recommended requirements are purely for eye candies
do your own research and you will find that is not the case with nwn
with that said i will make myself a reminder to look for ataris contact email so i can whine at the right placein conclusion this is an excellent game if you have the recommended gaming rig remember recommended  not minimum and have the patient to deal with the bugs
your best bet however is to wait a  more months for more patches to come out and probably at cheaper price to make it really worth itps
dont even think of giving this game to some kid for xmas if their computers dont meet the recommended stats  oh the disappointment
thats simply too cruelfirstly despite having a system with requirements i have to turn all the graphics options way down to make it even halfway playableconstant fighting with the camera to get a decent viewing positionvery very long loading screens
even for something as simple as going through a door in an inn to get to a upper flooressentially dull gameplay as you have to space bar pause the game endlessly in combat to fight with the camera to even find the next target
thats just with the fighter i rolled a caster would be even worsewasnt enjoying endless dialogue cut scenes either
i held out through the starting area hoping that it was just setting the stage and teaching game mechanics
then the first character you meet outside the start zone is a dwarven monk who likes punching people in the face and woohoo youre in luck because we can trek all the way to neverwinter togetherrrrrrrrrrrightuninstall
toss game into the used pile on amazon
post review so as not to feel guilty about selling it to anyone without a warning stars because it might play better on some kind of zomg powerful computerfirst the system stats pentium  ghz gb ram video nvidia geforce gt mbthe game has some serious flaws that still need to be fixed before it should have been released
my system is at or better then the recommended level of the game and the game is choppy most of the time
even with the video settings lowered
game loading is extremely slow going from one area to the next actually took  minutes to load
game play is also infuriating monster target areas are extremely small and sometimes you player end up running to the monster and just standing there while being hit
also going through doors can take forever while the otherside loads
there is no control over your npcs you have no say on if they should join or you want to get rid of one
this makes assigning skills for your player extremely critical try opening chests after your thief leaves
the camera positions have problems where its almost impossible to get a view
some of the rooms are so cluttered your player or npc gets hung up on the items and gets stuck
the npcs are not very smart they could go running off at any minute to do battle with other monsters that arent even close
if you reach a monster first most times they will stand directly behind and will just stand rather then moving around to where they could attack
still the graphics are nice and might be a good game if they fix the problemsi remember watching the trailer for the first nwn and actually holding my breath
i had immensely enjoyed baldurs gate i  ii and all their expansions a well as the icewind dale series
i had been enchanted by the best crpg ever planescape torment
now the same game developers were delivering a d cinematic version that would make total immersion inescapable
right
wrong oh boy so wrongmeasly henchmen replacing our deliciously diversified company nauseating camera movement infantile designed objects slow battle movements low polygon characters and bland storyline
now nwn had its virtues no doubt
it was such an original approach that games like wow and oblivion borrowed heavily from its innovative concept of a thirdperson cinematic rpg
nevertheless it suffered from raising the expectations bar too high  and then not delivering but a fraction of its obvious potential
it eventually got accepted by the moding community that created numerous ingenious mods that saved the dayit has been over a year now and nwn does not seem to take off
it is as if no one wants to concern himself with it
and for good reasonthe much higher system requirements do not translate onto the screen
there are improvements of course but not by much
it feels more like an expansion than a sequelthe camera movement is even worse
much worse
supposedly it positions itself in the best angle well i found myself spending more time repositioning the camera than the interacting with the charactersdoes it have bugs
enough to make a horror bmovie
patch after patch gets released and the damn thing still stutters and freezes and crashes
another fine example of an untested product rushed to the market unfinished
while traveling everything seems fine
when the battle heats up though and spells fly left and right all hell breaks loose
tweaking the video and graphics settings helps but does not eliminate all problemsall in all a game to avoid if a crpg fun
if new to rpg games do not start with this one you will get disappointed and may be miss out on true gemsanother fine example of accountants and stockjockeys meddling with an artform they cannot graspread the other reviews to get a good idea of what you will be dealing with
it is definitely buggyeven with updates
i firmly believe a game should be fully functional out of the box
this game requires and will continue to require updates and patches
i have a prerelease copy becausei was a beta tester
i have played the retail release version for over  weeksforget this game and go buy elder scrolls oblivion
to be honest if you want the best of both fps and rpg environmentsskip this game
the graphics are outdated the concept is outdated and the inventory management system is horrible
just wait till you have  or  characters to manage
utterly frustrating and time consuming
if you like clicking around with your mouse all dayyou could just cruise websitesit wont cost you a dimeor you could play this gamepass it over especially if you played the first nwn game
not much new folkselder scrolls oblivion is still the gold standardi started playing this game a week or two ago and there are a number of things i like and dislike about neverwinter nights  nwn that i wish i had known before i purchased this game
you might say this review is really more a commentary on how this game starts out from a nondd gamers perspective
i am up to chapter  in nwn and so have not finished
still a games first chapter should be fun right
nogood the story and graphics are fine one of the better aspects of this game
if i ever finish this game itll be for the story the world looks good the dungeons have some great details moving the herkyjerky camera view around all the time was something of a pain
i like the puzzles in the dungeonsmixed bag the characterizations of the ai party members range from bland elanee qara to pretty good khelgar to painfully fingernailsonachalkboard annoying neeshka
in fact not knowing any better i started multiclassing my druid as a druidrogue just so i can rid myself of neeshka asapbad the game has a lot of dd aspects that will seem like an alien language to anyone not familiar with dd
 pick up a piece of armor and it is nearly impossible to tell whether the armor is good or bad for your character or party members
likewise the multiclassing stats weapons etc
buried deep in the dense instruction manual was a snippet advising druid players not to multiclass
ugh
its too late for me to fix that now
that is an example of the types of arcane mysteries of this game
if you think half the fun of playing a game like this is figuring out just what the heck is going on and you also enjoy reading a very detailed and quite boring instruction manual you will absolutely love nwn i found the battles often very weird and nonintuitive with ai companions constantly doing what i did not want them to do
you can tweak their ai somewhat but not nearly enough nwn should have introduced more of the remaining ai companions much earlier in the game as you are essentially stuck with the good khelgar warrior the bland elanee druid and the highly irritating neeshka rogue for most of chapter  which is a huge and at times tediously long portion of the gamemy advice to beginners in this gamestart with a melee class or roguebear in mind that weight in your bags and in your armor can encumber you and slow you down
sell stuff oftenrest often save your game oftendont just blithely accept the gamerecommended skillups
i ended up wasting a lot of points in crafting skills that i would rather have spent elsewherei am looking forward to cryptics coming online game neverwinter as i cant help feeling it will be a vast improvement over neverwinter nights  will i finish nwn
maybe maybe not
my main reason for getting it was to see what the world is like in anticipation of neverwinter coming in late 
as a nondder i have to say i am hoping cryptic makes the worldgame substantially more intuitive than this dd nerdsonly messso is nwn fun
yeah kinda
and i am still slogging steadily forward
however i may not ever finish itwould i have bought nwn knowing what i know now
no i dont think somy recommendation wait for neverwinter cryptic dungeon siege  andor dragon age   all coming in  if like me you enjoy quality partybased storycentric games and want to play one now id recommend dragon age origins guild wars andor star trek online the latter  being mmos in name only really they are more singleplayer games and pretty decent ones at thatobsidiani have a couple of questions for you
it is illogical for you to spend thousands of dollars for  years on producing a game only to release it in a mostlyunplayable conditionwhy would anyone do that
didnt you notice that the market value for your game has achieved a world record by dropping down by as much as  during the first week of its release
what does that say
can anyone in obsidian please tell me what in heavens name were your testersif you have anydoing during the production of this game
i meanthere are glitches in the game that just beg to be noticedwere your testers really working hard for their money
after the release of nwnat this critical time of yeardo you really think that gamers will trust your name ever again
especially after spoiling the name of one of the best games ever
especially since this is not the first time that obsidian screws uphinttemple of elemental evil
i dont know if anyone from obsidian will ever get the chance to read this commentbut if anyone doesthen please know that everyone would be better off by not having this game released especially at this time of yearsimply putwhat a shameas someone that loved the old infinity engine crpgs baldurs gate icewind dale planescape torment and quite liked the original neverwinter nights despite its issues i had pretty high hopes for this game
in fact i got it pretty much on the day it was released
you can probably tell by the date of this review that it rather failed to arrest my attention
nwn  is a game that by all rights should have been great
unfortunately it suffers from some very serious unavoidable basic flaws that totally cripple the fun factoras one can expect the game engine and graphics are new and improved
you can certainly tell by how much longer it takes to load areas and how big a drag on system resources this game becomes
even current systems at the time of this writing lag at some points in the game and if your machine is borderline you can expect major issues even if you have everything turned down to minimum
in fact nwn  is more taxing on your pc than a lot of games that look a whole lot better and on that note it actually does not look a whole lot better than the old nwn
character models are especially bad and before you say thats just a game engine limitation check out the witcher sometime it uses the same one
i dont know how obsidian could have neglected character appearance when its probably the most critical visual factor in a game like this but they did
sound and effects are fortunately a lot better and this makes it somewhat tolerable in the multimedia departmentthe gameplay is sort of a mishmash between baldurs gate and nwn
you have more control over companions and can do some things like determine how they level up or control them directly in combat if you wish
unfortunately you probably will have to take direct control because the ai is absolutely atrocious
you thought the pathfinding in baldurs gate was bad
it looks positively brilliant compared to this
nwn is a new low characters getting stuck behind each other or on empty terrain for no reason running right into a room filled with traps not attacking enemies directly in front of them spellcasters choosing to melee instead of casting healers not healing party members that are on the verge of death the list goes on and on
fortunately theres some free downloadable hacks that go quite a ways towards fixing the ai and if you want to progress through the game at anything approaching a reasonable pace these are absolutely mandatory
on an additional note you cant multiclass any of your companions in the campaign all you can do is assign points and feats which is a shame
your main character can pick up to  total classes though the level cap of  limits you somewhat limited in terms of viabilitythe nwn  campaign has an overhead map that may bring back memories of baldurs gate
however the campaign more or less shoehorns you into going into certain places in a certain order and isnt a whole lot less linear than the old nwn
theres some halfhearted attempts at side quests including some companion quests and a phase where you get to manage your own castle but its nothing like baldurs gates extensive character development and exploration
if youve played bg youll end up sorely disappointed for a while it looks like nwn  is headed in the same direction and then it all just sort of stops or gets dumbed down to boredom
its an improvement over nwn in this regard but it has a long long way to go to get to the level of even the original baldurs gate
as far as the campaign story goes its pretty runofthemill
no real surprises not particularly imaginative in short a whole lot like the lackluster original nwn campaign
ive yet to try out the expansions for this game and itll probably be some time before i do on account of how little i enjoyed this campaign
even on a loot note theres not a whole lot to be had
i started noticing a lot of duplicate items about halfway through and after checking the total lists with the toolset i was appalled by how few items there are in the game not to mention how dumb most look
most of them arent even provided with any interesting background just generic statstheres a few additional and new features that have potential
the game uses the dd  rules and is somewhat more streamlined than the original
it still takes a bit of slot juggling to figure out what stacks with what but a lot of the weirder things have been simplified or removed
there are new races including some that are more powerful than the standard ones and thus incur a level penalty not a good thing considering theres only  levels
theres a new base class in the campaign the warlock and a decent collection of prestige classes
unfortunately due to the cap and the fact that you cant multiclass your companions you probably wont get to experience most of the latter unless you either cheat or keep replaying the campaign which as noted above is not exactly great fun
theres also some new item creation feats and skills though in practice i found them to be too difficult to keep track of and not a whole lot of use anyway
theres also attempts at replay value in the campaign using the new influence system but most of these come very late in the game and dont have a very serious impact on what actually happens anyway
theres also not a whole lot of motivation for doing what few optional quests there are since most are quite boring and as with the original nwn youll hit the cap before you finish either wayas for character customization you can alter appearance name skills feats and class
in general you really want to stick with one type of class eg
if you choose to be a spellcaster you should stick with that and related prestige classes
trying to get your character to do everything makes you pretty weak all around since this isnt an epic campaign
then again if you dont really care about having a powerful main character do whatever
the game isnt particularly hard and your companions can probably take up the slack
as with nwn you can use skills in some dialogue choices and world actions though aside from bluffintimidate these are pretty darn rare
in particular skills like listen survival and intimidate are so rarely used they might as well have just taken them out
some reviewers have said that the game favors melee classes but this is definitely not true once you get out of the noob stage
in fact i would say spellcasters are favored in the latter two thirds of the game on account of how many huge packs of weak monsters you encounter nothing like aoe to clean that up right quick
you can rest almost anywhere and it only takes a few seconds which makes memorized spell limits a nonissue unless you get into a really drawnout fight not common
that aside seeing spells go off is one of the only real highlights of the games combat system weapon based attacks are so boring you dont even watch after a whilei do believe nwn  has potential and the expansions may manifest that
so could player made content since the toolset allows you to change practically anything
however the outofbox nwn  campaign is barely an improvement over the nwn original campaign that one fortunately got better with expansions but the original was a bore and really didnt hold my attention
it looks rushed unfinished in graphic and quest design and has tons of new angles that could have been really cool if they were actually done right
the simple sad fact is that theres a lot of better rpgs out there and have been since nwn s release which is why it took me so long to get through this game
in that light i really cant recommend this titlefirst of all this game was not from jonathan boakes although it is in the style of dark fall and he does provide voice talent
nucleosys is an argentinean studio and this is the first adventure game from argentinaon the plus side the graphics were exquisite the house layout was easy to navigate and there is an interesting albeit underdeveloped option to turn on hintsoverall its clear that nucleosys has the potential to do some really great adventure games
this isnt one of them though
there were enough bright spots of cleverness to give me hope for the next nucleosys game but many of the puzzles were incredibly nonintuitive
if you can finish this game without resorting to walkthroughs then i congratulate youalso the story was weak
the only goal of the first part of the game was tryingultimately unsuccessfully mind youto turn on the electricity
none of it was scary and some of the plot twists were tired please can we not have any more exotic african curses
i can never find enough games like dark fall and syberia so i recommend scratches as adequate entertainment until the next really good one comes out
maybe itll come from nucleosysits the ending that is disappointing
i had lots of fun and chills all the way through until i got to the end
then i was left hanging
many many unanswered questions
the ending made no real sense
granted its only a video game id like a little bit of sense in the end
its like watching a really lowbudget horror movie whose only motive is sensationalism and viewer terror
you walk through this game asking a lot of questions and making logical assumptions about what the climax will probably be
then tata
screams and horror with no intellectual value
if you like horror films that are simply scary with nothing else to offer this is the game for you
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbtatathe best games of this type immerse us in a world that requires to think in ways other than the usual linear mode we often use
this game doesnt do that
there is seldom any involvement with puzzles other than finding the various items scattered around the game and then combining them with something else that is usually obviousor annoyingly otherwisethis game fails most of all at plot
it would have been so much better if it had settled on one batch of gimmicks instead of mixing two together that dont add up  sometimes you gotta pick is it gonna be african tribal black magic or is it gonna be creepy sociopathic behaviour that drives the storymaybe with considerable skill you could try to work with both but the builder of this games plot doesnt have what it takesin the end despite the often impressive visuals it falls apartits impossible not to be reminded of the first resident evil game which has set the standard incredibly high for any game that wants to put a lone character in a creepy old mansion and then have ever stranger events unfold around that character
if youre going to play on that field you had better have brought your big girl pants
too bad the makers of scratches didnt give us the stuffthis game will be forgotten quickly i thinki feel misled by the positive reviews
i like adventure games when they are not all based on finding the right pixel to click on and when they are not soporific
unfortunately this is both
frankly it seems as if im back in the early s playing th guest
the graphics are utterly disappointing and very very static
you constantly run into doors that all look the same and most of them are locked
the music is eerie but so what
it seems theres nothing to do but open drawers find useless junk or yet another old tarnished candelabrum or not very mysterious clues or at best endless verbose journals that refer to a terror that is almost indescribable
lots of british accents some better than others couldnt keep me awakeas a fan of past football simulations from the commodore  days with head coach to the weak but fun football mogul series i was excited to learn that ea sports was going to make a nfl simulator
now ea really upset me a year ago when they took the nfl license and killed the best football series ever espn k
but i was willing to give them another chance with head coach
the verdict i am still mad at eai installed nfl head coach and already had a problem
it was telling me my directx wasnt up to date so i had to go to the ea site and hunt for a fix for it
once installed i was ready and excited to play out my life as a head coachi was pretty happy for a while
even though it seemed tedious the day to day was fun but i couldnt wait to get to actual coaching
i signed and drafted players kept my staff and started spring training
while i was sad to see little options on talking to players the practices were fun and i could see improvement in the playersthen came the preseason game
oh mythis is where the game fails
first of all you cant save midgame at all
that is a big nono to me
i sometimes cant sit and play for too long
then the ai in the game was horrible as my qb who is a pocket passer would run a lot and i could make easy plays often
and subbing players was a nightmare because you had little time to do iti havent made it to my second preseason game because honestly the ingame coaching was terrible and boring
this has all the workings of being a good game but playing madden  as a coach is better than this
i hope they do release one next year
and even though this has my favorite coach cowher on the cover it will just go with the rest of my steelers collectables for nowi love eas madden football games
ive been playing madden since the original madden hit the shelves for the sega genesis
but i was real excited when this game was announced because it sounded like it would perhaps be like madden except that you control the sidelines instead of being on the fieldwell after getting this on the first day it was released and spending a lot of hours playing it i can say that i am already bored to tears with it and highly annoyed by itthe main problem with this game is that they went way overboard on the what its like to be a coach thing
it is literally an hourbyhour head coach simulation during the entire offseason
there are just so many tedious things to do
everything from sitting down with the owner over and over and over and hearing all his nonesense
then you have to attend meeting after meeting with your position coaches which is just plain not fun
then running practices
blech
there really isnt anything fun about running the same play over and over and over in hopes of seeing incremental ratings changes of your playersthe college draft could have been a lot of fun but even that they ruined by insisting on running it nearly realtime
you make a pick and literally have to sit there and wait for half an hour until you get to pick again with seemingly no way to fastforward that
and again the presentation of the draft was very disappointing
for example they make it really awkward to try to do something as simple as looking up statistics on the players you have already drafted or the ones you have scouted much less the ones you haventit took me over  hours of gameplay just to reach the first game
and then what a letdown
the gameday presentation is just a shadow of what it is in madden and the games themselves are rediculous shams
the computer ai is poor the play by play is almost nonexistant
the statistics are presented in an almost unreadible way
and its buggy as heck
for example it tells you that you lost yardage on most plays where you score a touchdown
also its usually showing the results of a couple plays back on the scoreboard rather than keeping up with that game as its happeningargh
this game had so much promise but it was completely ruined by adding in too many tedious elements and obviously not game play testing this near enoughi really wanted to like this game i really did
i was very forgiving for a lot of things but as time went on i simply realized the game is just not fun
i love strategy games sports manager games and maddens franchise mode
but there are just too many things that nfl head coach does wrong that it really clouds the few ideas that the game does righti like the games use of assistant coaches talking to agents scheduling practice and i love the dynamic draft
one of my few critiques of maddens franchise mode is how the draft zips by and you cant slow the game down to see which players went where
nfl head coach goes team by team and even has suggestions from your scout
awesome and adds to the drama of draft day as you wonder if a top player youve been scouting and need will make it to your pick in the round
i also enjoyed making my own custom head coach and having an officewith that said there are just too many things that this game does wrong
some you may have heard these before but ill repeat just to emphasize what many have said already  the interface is one of the worst ive ever experienced in a game
this is classic laziness of a developer to copy and paste a console interface for the pc
the button colors are surprisingly the same for a psxbox gamepad but the keyboard buttons are extremely unintuitive
also every fact on your players and the league in general is contained in subwindows and deeper subsubwindows
ok this is tolerable barely but to get back to the main screens you need to go in reverse through all these screens instead of using a shortcut
it becomes very tedious
finally the game inexplicably forces you to go fishing for information about each player instead of just using the simple elegant design used in madden
i dont mind the game using maddens designs if they work well
the scheduling of tasks is way overboard
i understand what ea was going for here
they want people to really consider this a hardcore coaching simulation
let the casual players play maddens franchise mode
ok fine
but the use of tasks that force players to roleplay a coachs schedule hour by hour is pointless
players want the interesting parts of coaching not the tedium of office hours that limit you to a certain number of actions per day
a more effective break down of time is required
i hate to refer back to madden again because i understand they wanted to create a different product but different does not have to imply tedious
there are plenty of sports management games out there the front office series anything mogul the championship manager franchise for soccer that have successfully produced entertaining sports management experiences despite the abundance of player data game data and the time constraints of a season
i have never never never played a game with so many load screens in my life
it is unnecessary and pointless
just lazy lazy design
random crashes
particularly for me during practice session
which leads me to  the practice sessions are dull and repetitive
again i understand this is what coaches really do
but i bet they go to the bathroom and pick their nose too
i dont need those things simulated nor do i need to run through every practice
i would have been happy with just scheduling practice but not having to watch every
single
play
althoughg you do have the option to skip coaching practice you lose the ability to create money plays which are plays that you have rehearsed so often they have a high chance of success on gameday
also the game punishes your simulation of practices with higher frequencies of injury or players which are often not ready for game day
which leads me to player development
players are granted range of ability scores ex
strength  that change throughout the season
if a player is well prepared and practiced he will peak near game day
however these scores all plummet the very next day
players must then be retrained through practice again and again every single week
again it may be somewhat real but it is tediously dull
i guess the designers were trying to emphasize the need for between game and preseason practices
real
yes
boring
yes
it would have been enough to require practice to maintain player ability scores instead of the need for practices to continually replenish ability levels before game day
which brings me to  gameday
some people do not like the graphics used here
i dont mind
ive dealt with plenty of textonly or dotsonafield sports management sims that its refreshing to watch a game
but this is not a normal nfl game
first of all only  minute quarters are allowed
i understand this is to prevent the padding of scores with excess plays from button mashers but madden again
allows me to modify the quarter times
the  minute quarters are too short to produce nfllevel numbers for offense and defense
also on the field adjustments are nearly impossible in pc mode
it requires the fast paced button pressing of a gamepad
if you want to adjust your linebackers and tell your corners to enter bump and run forget it
the plays almost always starts before you have a chance
as for the game itself you are practically guaranteed to have at least  interceptions for both quarterbacks every single time
 is the norm
while passing for  yards
every game
maybe if im joey harrington sure but not for peyton manning
motivation mode is worthless
example
my qb just threw an  yard touchdown
i tell him hes doing a great job out there
he responds negatively and his stats drop
gee im sorry i complimented you
also you are limited to  choices for motivation strategy aggressive and passivecomplimentary but have no idea how players will react
whats worse if you use the same strategy twice on a player he may react positively and then negatively on the very next attempt
or vice versa
its better to just not use or even include this feature at all
to be fair i did enjoy the ability to tell individual players to emphasize particular aspects of their gameplay like concentrate on stopping the run or throw the ball out of bounds if you are under pressure
well done theredespite all of these issues i really enjoyed the idea of coaching my nfl team
but in the end i didnt enjoy the actual experience
in one particularly revelatory moment while wading through screens and screens of info i felt that not only wasnt i enjoying the game i wasnt even playing the game
it was as if the game was playing itself with the simulation screens watching the games without being able to adjust the rulestimeplays being shackled to an unnecessary daily schedule etc the i was just fighting to create my own enjoyable coaching experience which the game would not allow
so i gave up
guess which game i will be buying to get that experience
yes madden
its a shame
i always wanted a deeper version of maddens franchise mode but not at the expense of enjoyment much less playabilityin conclusion ernest hemmingway once said the first draft of anything is st  if nothing writing is rewriting
that philosophy really sums up nfl head coach
i think of this game as the awful first draft of a potentially great series
although there are multiple problems they are all solvable
in fact theyve already been solved in maddens franchise mode
its funny you can see them trying to make a different game to avoid complaints from players that its too much like madden but instead committed a worse sin they created an unplayable game
what im encouraged about is that all the good aspects of nfl head coach are all new ideas interviewing for your first head coaching job hiring assistant coaches designing my own coaching avatar the dynamic draft changing player strategy and dealing with agents
but i just get the feeling the developers decided to dump this on the public and design next years version based on the criticisms of this game dimensions of murder is the third installment in the pc version of csi
as a fan of csi i was entertained by the complicated stories the interaction between suspects yourself and csi agents and the general feel of the game dimensions starts to stumble with the same problems the others had
while i like having to search the scene for evidence and put the pieces together myself getting through an hour long stage to find i missed a single piece of evidence or forgot a test and comparison check is frustrating
having to find that last shred before you could question a suspect or perform a test was incredibly annoying as you could spot what was coming well before the evidence accumulated to the point that the game decided it was time to advanceprobably the worst condemnation is the fact that there has been no real improvement despite being the rd incarnation
the stages are still run as point and click and are otherwise not interactive
its a matter of patiently running your mouse cursor over row after row of pixels to spot the few items on an otherwise static screen and the almsot snide remarks for your fellow agents when time after time the remark nothing over there
way to be thorough
while the zoom inzoom out camera effects and thought play you know and love from the show are great i wouldve rather had an option to walk around in a basic d room crouch and stand have a sprite hand that actually open and shut doors and drawers
aside from the filmed sequences the only cgi motion is from the csi agents and suspects which is dull
the pheonix wright games from the nintendo ds had just as much motion to them as this didwhile id recommend this to any fan of csi as its a acceptable injection for those of you who desperately need a fix almost any other mystery game ive played to date can surpass it in almost every category with the exception of movie content and voice acting which probably got most of the budget
agatha christie and sherlock holmes games that go for  for  deals in the bargain bin have more of what it takes to make a good adventure mystery gamewhat an interesting journey i had with this game
i tried the demo got hooked played the full game and had the game freeze up on me requiring a hard reboot over and over and over
i couldnt figure out what on earth was causing this
i cleared all viruses spyware and defragged
then i googled and found that this game does not work with certain ati radeon cards
im using a  pro
i think i read it may just be this problem with the  radeon series
if the demo freezes on you the full game will too so dont waste your time or money
how can i play graphicintensive games like half life  fear call of duty  far cry the indigo prophecy etc
but i cant play this
they say this game makes the ati cards overheat
huh
i think the only way thats possible is if ubisoft screwed up the coding because these graphics are no big dealhow bad did i want to play this game
i actually switched out my radeon with an old nvidia card just to play it
and it was pretty good for a while
as a strictly cinematic experience this game definitely got it right
where it fails is in the interactive experience
the dialogue character and evidence are all incredible in my opinion
while at times all the evidence might get too confusing and complicated for the most part the stories were wonderful
but the gameplay ends up getting old
youre required to talk to one person then go talk to another person after that which of the  people
why find out by trial and error
fun
nope
every time you switch between people you get a loading time which is really annoying
this game is so reliant on the cinematic factor i almost think the game could have been better if they just told you talk to this person
now talk to this person instead of leaving you guessing
on the other hand when youre not stuck the game flows quickly and nicely
when you are stuck it just sucks
bottom line
this game is fun at first and then wears out its welcome
i think this could have been an excellent game if some more work was put into it to improve the gameplay
unfortunately youre left with a game that screams mediocre
at least its fun to play a couple of cases just to see how the story and dialogue goes and theres only  cases i think so youre not getting a lot for your money as far as quantity eitheri was hoping to get a bargain when i bought this for  dollars

its interesting to monitor your player development operating under a budget negotiate trades etcthen lets move on to the fair
the graphics are okay
its not as bad as what you may have read elsewhere but i think thats the best thing i can say about it
the pitching screen where you get the standard tv view from behind the pitcher looks fantastic
everything else is fair
the sound is pretty good the first time around but then it just starts sounding tired
worse during season or franchise play the game previews that play during load time reflects none of your seasonal progress at all
being a mariners fan i played the ms into a  game winningstreak only to have the announcer proclaim that the mariners have not executed well lately before the game startedthen theres the bad
remember when your coaches told you in little league not to wait for the grounder to come to you but to run up to it instead
well your infielders will almost always wait for the ball to bounce to them instead resulting in unnecessary close plays at first or infield singles at least it rolls both ways
the computer picks the wrong fielders for you every so often and before you realized that you have already moved someone else out of position
baserunning is alright as long as you dont have more than one person on base
otherwise its difficult
the wallclimbing plays are very cool but it needs to be cut down
torii hunter robbing people homeruns is awesome manny ramirez doing it twice a game is science fiction
there are a lot of little details that just ruin the game on the whole
sometimes after groundouts your hitter would just keep on jogging down the first baseline
outfielders would often keep on running along the wall after watching a homer leave the ballpark
in franchise mode where you cant control the weather it would often rain inside safeco field
yes guys it rains often in seattle and thats why safeco field has a retractable roof
all these details add up to show me that the developers forgot to actually play the game before selling it to the general public
had it been priced at  like the old k series games i would say its a good game
but at  what youre getting is a halfbaked product by a studio that essentially decided not to pay attention to the details in a video game that simulates a sport all about the detailspros audio commentary by jon miller and joe morgancons like all k games the controls are so overly complex that you cant pickup and play the game
even when you do understand the controls theyre so awkward that it isnt even fun theres no feel to pitching or hitting
a homerun feels the same as a single
pitching is a disaster graphics look the same as a ps game from  years ago
why does this game warrant a higher price tag
 game freezes messy interface difficult to navigatei cant imagine a worse baseball game
couple this with the freeze issues many people are having and this is without question one of the worst games for the i thought this game was going to be the best baseball game ever if they would have just upgraded the rosters on k it would have been better
sometimes change isnt good they change all this gameplay and didnt have the decency  have a tutorial
the graphics suck and games are not all about the graphics but k looks better
im a ea sports tan and ppl were downgrading their games at least they were realistic i notice on all the k sport titles that they have a habbit of putting in all these game modes and extras but they dont do anything  the graphics yal need to step yal game up k sports cuz all the graphics in your games suck this is definetly trade in bait
vote  ea sportsi was thinking what could be more fun than playing in the era of the roman empire
well i never got very far in the game because it was so slow and boring
one day when its really bad weather and im bored i will try it againokay if youve played lots of other harvest moon games beforemaybe you should skip buying this one and wait for the newest installment for ds coming out in junethe controlls are confusing to figure out and the beginning story and music you will hear during the games are very cheesy
like i couldnt stand it and had to turn it off cheesyi liked wonderful life for gamecube much better
magical melody tries to be kinda like friends of mineral town which ive already played so i was looking for new imporvements in the game
the improvements werent enough to maintain my interest in this one
yah you earn music notes but you earn a music note just for falling down
like i said i was unimpressedsonic is among the older franchises in games and also the more beloved famous and unpredictable
he has seen many good games and many bad games his first racing game of this century falls somewhere in between
while sonic riders has enough cool moments to be somewhat interesting it falls short in too many areas to be worthwhilethe story in sonic riders is absolutely terrible
sonic is made fun of mercilessly by the annoying jet the hawk whose voice cracks every  syllables for being slow of all things
jet leads the babylon rogues who are basically a band of three annoying thieves who think theyre all that
eggman holds a tournament to see whos the fastest on extreme gear hover boards the entry fee
oh just a measly chaos emerald
you know the ones hes always trying to collect and take over the world with
yeah those ones
but wait sonic and friends just give the chaos emeralds to eggman this time rather than protect them so they can race in a silly tournament where the winner supposedly gets all the emeralds
did sonic suddenly lose his brain or something
this is just painful
long story short the ancient city of babylon emerges when the seven chaos emeralds are united with jets mystical blue cube and you go in and race a genie and thats the end of the game
the story is so not soniclike has so many ridiculous plot holes and is so totally unfitting to a racing game that its just a pain to watch and the absolutely dreadful voice acting drags it even lower
the story can be completed in less than  hours which is bad because the game is so outrageously short but also good because it makes the story end soonerbut seriously who plays a racing game for story
i for one play for the races and sonic riders has its strong points and weak points in that area
the races are mildly exciting as you perform cool tricks and boost your way through the games  courses or  if you count the juiced up night versions of each
the gameplay has some exciting moments namely while performing flips and spins in midair which are executed with simple tilts of the control stick
the concept of racing on hover boards is really cool in itself too and causes a little bit of fun on its own
it gives the game a futuristic feel kind of like fzero only without the overabundance of quality racing or sense of speedlike fzero sonic games are all about going fast but riders pretty much fails to deliver that sense of speed
the speedometer says youre going about  mph most of the time but it feels like youre still flying through at less than  mph
the remaining gameplay mechanics dont work very well either
boosting barely increases your speed for more than a second turning is a serious pain you have to take pit stops and riding turbulence caused by other racers boosts causes too many frustrations that are out of your control
you often get caught in a strip of turbulence when you dont want to causing you to miss a needed pit stop or rings
pit stops also slow the game down considerably
you have an air meter which increases as you level up by collecting rings and when you run out of air your character gets off his or her board and starts running on foot until you get some more air at a pit stop or by going off a jump and doing some tricks
the concept of an air meter really hurts the concept of hover boards making the gameplay hard to call good or bad
consider that alongside the lack of a sense of speed and really its just averagesonic riders also has a wealth of other modes whose quality can only be judged by each individual player
mission mode offers a lot of gameplay but the missions are very repetitive and dont vary much at all
earning gold medals on each mission can be fun but it doesnt take long to get tired of mission mode all together due to the sheer repetition
tag mode pairs you up with another racer and you share an air tank and cant get too far away from each other
i found this mode to be a pain for obvious reasons
survival mode is probably sonic riders strongest mode
the special race type here involves one player holding an emerald and going through gates while holding the emerald and the other players frantically trying to get the emerald because once a player passes through  gates while holding the emerald they win
there is also a battle mode under the survival mode which i didnt understand in the slightest but it appeared decent enough for some people to enjoyin action sonic riders looks pretty nice
the graphics are very smooth animations are very nice and everything looks good
during an average cutscene the graphics look a tad choppy
in the rare cg cutscene however the visuals are very sharp and look about as good as an animated movie although nowhere near pixar quality of coursestill during the cutscenes it doesnt really matter how good they look because of the dreadful storyline and horrible voice acting which brings us to the area of sound
the voice acting is dreadful the lines are said in the cheesiest ways the voices are really poorly done and there are voice cracks galore
the sound effects sound good though catching turbulence actually has a really cool sound and everything sounds like it should
the music is really fitting to the games semifuturistic concept but as far as fitting the courses they fail
hearing the same kind of music on a jungle course as a city course just doesnt make much sense
none of the tunes are memorable by any means eitheroverall sonic riders is just not a very good game
the exciting moments and cool concept cant save it from its lack of control shortness and many frustrations
riders doesnt bring sonic down or up from where he is now it just solidifies his position as a character who can star in a game of any sort of quality whether it be good bad or just soso
as far as riders is concerned its just sosopositive cool racing concept some really fun moments survival mode is pretty solid animated cutscenes look greatnegative terrible story starring even worse voice acting outrageously short story although that can be a good thing too very few courses no real sense of speed too many things can happen that are out of your control pit stopsthe final verdict sonic riders has a cool concept and some fun moments but that cant save it from the lack of control general shortness and plethora of frustrations
riders is best left on the store shelfscore as a series devil may cry started and peaked with the original devil may cry video game for the ps
devil may cry  and dmc  special edition follow the same general formula as the original game
plenty of combat laden areas and cool looking weapons a hero and an antagonist seeking power
the storyline of the series has never been the main focus and that is apparent in this game
characters are brought in almost at random and with cloudy reasoning for their motivationswhat has always set the dmc games apart from the rest is the action packed sequences and boss battles
while dmc  has plenty of both youll end up lamenting purchasing the game due to its definitively tired controls abysmal voice acting broken camera system and poor storylinein deciding to make dmc  a prequel to dmc capcom presents a much younger version of dante
in an effort to project the younger version capcom also made him somewhat immature
while you may argue that this decision is appropriate youll quickly realize in playing the game that dante resembles a hyperactive adolescent boy
the sequences in between combat are laughable as any time dante opens his mouth its an embarrassment to the talented folks at capcommore than any other complaint  the terrible controls broken camera system dated formula  it is the voice acting that prevented me from liking the game
the script is cheesy at times and the voice actors are always unbelievable
stay awaylately there have been a number of games made based on classic movies from russia with love the godfather scarface and theyve all had mixed results and for those expecting anything halfway decent out of the video game adaptation of quentin tarantinos debut film should steer clear of reservoir dogs
the game basically runs parallel to the film with many of the scenes from the film redone in full cg effect though many of the cutscenes look pretty bad
your job is to carry out missions based on events that you only heard about in the film ranging from car chases dodging cops and above all taking hostages to survive
whats really sad about reservoir dogs is how quickly boring the game gets
while you can choose to be a violent psychopath or a smooth professional criminal either way the game gets pretty boring pretty quickly and taking hostages doesnt really do much to the already lame ai
the best thing about the game is by far the audio and voice acting even if michael madsen is the only cast member to lend his voice to the game
the graphics are choppy and the controls serve their purpose but beyond that there isnt anything here that we havent seen or heard before and it hardly does justice to the source material
all in all even if youre a die hard fan of the film this is better left on the shelfi am an avid adventure gamer and always have been
after growing up playing such wonderful games as grim fandango the monkey island series and the longest journey it absolutely pains me to see where the genre is going
i had relatively high hopes for this game seeing as its marketed towards fans of syberia but after even the first five minutes i could tell i was in for a boring experienceyou are a girl searching for your friend celeste at the dragonvale academy
think hogwarts without any of the charm or creativity
you arrive to discover the place deserted and come across a keepsake of celestes
this sparks a journey of discovery in serach of your lost friendthe premise for the game is okay but the delivery is just plain terrible
the voice acting is subpar especially when giants like dreamfall the longest journey are setting the standard and verges on awful at times
the character animations are clunky and they move at a speed that would make my grandmother say hurry up would you
youre holding us up
the pacing of the game is also too slow for its own good
perhaps youre on a journey of discovery but theres certainly no rush to find celestethe only reason i gave it a  instead of a  is because of the okay graphics
they dont blow you away and they pale in comparison to recent titles like the elder scrolls iv oblivion but they are by far the best part of the gamemy suggestion is take your thirty bucks elsewhere and buy a game worthy of your support
like the longest journey or dreamfall or syberia
i love adventure games but this is a new low even for the adventure companyprosthe graphics are okayconspretty much everything elsethe voices are terriblethe animations are clunkythe puzzles are boringthe story is boringnothing new herei bought keepsake a couple months ago and paid less than  for it because its an older game
its clearly stated on the game that it is ok with an xphowever there are two places in the game where when i clicked on a place my computer suddenly rebooted
and the reboot would stall
i had to unplug the computer and start it up again to get function
this happened in two places twice  clicking on the dumb waiter in the pantry and moving a knob on the dragon light puzzle in the garden
i went to the official website and found only one patch for voices
didnt seem like that was my problem but i downloaded it anywayi started a second game and printed out two walkthroughs one by wicked designs who created the game
i did this to make sure that i hadnt missed any triggers
sometimes when you do something out of order a game has hiccups
the same problems occured in the second game
i got as far in the game as i could without using these two steps
and then the same thing happened
in both places the computer would rebooot and there didnt seem to be anything i could do about iti have had trouble with other older dreamcatcher games where the box says it works on an xp but then it doesnt without glitchesim bummed because i enjoyed the game as far as i got according to the walkthroughs less than half done
i gave it four stars for fun and two stars overall
i love the game graphics  totally cool castle  and the gameplay and puzzles werent too easy or too hard
the voice acting is not that good and some of the dialouge was pretty cheesy
but overall it was fun to playi know people rant and rave about this game like its the best thing since sliced bread
i just could not get into it
the concept sounded cool and the visuals are cool but the fact that the dialogue is in some made up mumble is annoying
that fact alone is what made me stop playingblah ill make this review snappy
i dont care what people say this game sucks and its obviously made for kids only
the idea of using a paintbrush in the game is supposedly innovative
yet not fun or interesting
sure whatevergoing by all of the rave reviews of this game on amazon i thought for sure itd be a winner
so i gave it a shot
im a very flexible gamer and am not picky in the least but im sorry its really just not a fun game
at least not for me
while maybe its just that i havent gotten into it enough ive played at least  hours and i think that entitles me to a reviewthe opening to the game is pretty cool i guess but then pretty much right away it drags on and on and starts to bore you
perhaps my main gripe so far with this game is that its very easy to get lost and  or loose track of what to do  what youre doing
ive read that this game is comparable to past zelda games
i dont think so
this game is no where near that enticingthis is one i really just dont get
it took some time for me to catch on with shadow of the colossus but i got there and eventually ended up loving it
dont see that happening with okami
in all fairness im not a fan at all of the very detailed and layered japanese style games where you wander endlessly like a tard not knowing what to do next ie
metal gear
this game is the poster boy for such a genre
purchase at yout own risk this game is a borelet me start off by saying okami has great cell shaded graphics rarely done well enough to be note worthy but capcom did it right here but as we all know graphics dont make a game
okami was so hard for me to play i didnt know who it was actually made for or why the people who ranted on about it to me would ever feel the way they do thus why i think it is made for children also taking in consideration there is some annoying demon sitting on your head telling you what to do after running around aimlessly
you run along paths with some clearings here and there so to me it felt like i was traversing a great tree lined office labyrinth
while the paint brush tool is clever its pretty clumsy and simple
it would be one thing if i had to figure it out for myself when to use it but the little bug guy chimes in before you can think for yourself
oh we need to make some water here
oh well a squiggle or two should cut it and walla
i do like being a wolf but that and the eye candy alone dont make this a good game
also okami was released in  or  long after many d platforming greats such as mario  mega man legends or shadow of the colossus so i just dont understand what it is that makes people think this is either indy or fantastically originali can sit and play ff for hours even in k but this bugged me through and through in i am normally an extremely fair individual about reviewing games
i had so much trouble running this game on my desktop with win  bit and a dual processor that i tried to run it on my single core processor laptop
this still didnt work for me
after trying to get some product support which doesnt exist anymore i got totally fed up and just downloaded a pirated version
i figure i sure wasnt stealing anything since i owned the original in my hands
this should make all game producers take note of the drm fad thats sweeping the gaming industry
in all fairness though the game is really good if you can get it to run on your rigi do not yet have this game but reading the reviews it sounds exactly like the second game in the legend of spyro series
i am mainly reviewing to say that my opinion of enter the dragon hasnt changed at all give insomniac the reigns to the spyro series because they did it better
the original spyro games for the ps are much better
i loved spyro because of the collecting of gems eggs and other items not for the fighting and that is exactly what universal or whoever is making the games now has done is made into a long continous and therefore boring battle
all i can say is dont waste your money on the spyro games for ps ps or the wiithe legend of spyro  a new beginning for the gamecube tries to capitalize on the fantastic spyro series which i adore
however this is not a worthy sequel or prequelfirst a lot of the hype about the game is that they have great actors voicing the parts now
elijah wood frodo is spyro
david spade is sparx the dragonfly
it just doesnt work well
the sparx character really annoyed me at several sections of the game
they moved away from cute and fun to turn the sound off
speaking of which the background sound balance is off so that half the time you cant heard whats being saidon one hand the graphics are pretty  on the other hand the camera drives me completely insane
nice eyecandy jewels do not make up for frustrating gameplaythe gameplay feels more violent
the creatures scream in agony as you repeatedly flame them
im not sure if this is supposed to be darker or more brutal
either way it detracts from the fun to me
pretty much all of your game is beating up on things
youre missing the fun minigames and quests that other spyro games offeralso the game is short
at least if there was long playability here you could excuse a few other problems but for what youve paid for the game you barely get into a weekend with itim not quite sure what happened here
its not like the game makers had any question about what really works in the spyro game
the previous spyro games were huge sellers and had a very loyal fan base
why deliberately harm a franchise that was doing so well
why deliberately shorten it so drastically
it really seems like they wanted some quick easy cash and hoped that nobody would notice how poor the game was
or if they did notice that it would be too late because they already played the gamei highly suggest you rent this game for a weekend  youll undoubtedly finish the game over that weekend
if you really find you adore the game then great
buy a copy and enjoy
i really think though that youll find a weekend is more than enough time with thisrating this game had so much potential
excellent graphics good sound decent level environments easy controls new moves interesting breaths
but it was very short and very repetitive the main enemies were one character throughout the entire game they just changed costumes in each level only about  levels no portals these main characters also made the same sounds throughout a few different rivals are added due to the level you are inthere are constant film sequences interrupting game play some in which you can not skipand there is little to no reply value like the first  games in the series for playstation and the level where you learn your new powers can not be passed by this would be nice to skip if you have already beaten the game once note no more portals here
if you want classic spyro your looking in the wrong place
this game was disappointing
fun for the first run through
 suggested rent before purchaseso if youve played the demo you might be thinking cool  a game with some guns some melee combat and a dark cool story to go along with it
unfortunately the demo is very short and doesnt provide you with a good idea of how bad and boring the game is
for one thing the game is way too dark
its not that im against darkness in a game but this is just ridiculous
i thought doom  was the darkest game ever  i stand corrected
going around from room to room in pitch black is boring but not as boring as the melee combat
block hit block hit you cant even hit someone twice in a row or theyll hit you
yawn
the sprint function is the most pointless sprint ive ever seen in my life
your character barely moves faster and he also cant sprint up stairs huh
its very obvious the game makers should have made the character move a bit faster all the time
so youll be holding down your shift key the whole game for no reason whatsoever
youre limited to the ammo contained in guns you pick up so say you pick up a gun with  bullets you use those  bullets and then have to pick up another melee weapon
not a good idea
i really cant think of much good to say about condemned
if you want to play a dark game where you shoot things why not just go play doom 
and if you want a good story why not just go play an adventure game
skip this onei have been a fan since caesar ii plebs are needed anyone
and thoroughly enjoyed caesar iii battle preparation was fun
however i found caesar iv to be dull and sadly annoying
it took only about  hours of play to realize that i would never enjoy this game to the extent that i do both caesar iii which works great on my win  fx system and caesar ii which works fine running on virtual pc with win installed
everything is turned up to the max and looks good but the gameplay just isnt therenot sure if this helps anyone make a decision or not but i disliked the original tropico just not very good enjoyed tropico  thoroughly and very much enjoyed tropico   that way if anyone is familiar with those games well they can get an idea of my taste for city building and decide if my opinion is worth taking into consideration before purchasing caesar ivi just picked up a copy of spellforce  shadow wars today after reading the great reviews on here and hearing that it was a truly revolutionary contribution in the rts genre from my gaming shop
i believe it is only mediocre at bestspellforce  is indeed a combination of an rts and an rpg although it only manages to do both of those on a marginal level
it plays like an rts in an rts engine with a character leveling and skill development system built inthe first thing i noticed about it were badly dated graphics
warcraft iii command and conquer generals and warhammer dawn of war look far better and are much more polished than this title
the animations such as the way a character runs and walks are jerky and rushed the spells are boring and oversimplified in fact you dont even have control over when to use them the ai decides for youthe game runs well mostly because of its poor graphicsi expected originality from this title and that appears to have been the developers selling point
it fails to meet its only goal to be different from other rts titles
it has a very simple cast of units nothing out of the ordinary soldier crossbowman mage superunit the game box claims to have nine playable sides but there are only three in reality because the three factions have three races inside of them which each consist of two to four units and one or two buildings eachive played many rts titles and originality and depth go a long way with me
this title has neither and i believe the developer has no right to advertise either of those as its strong pointsif youre looking for originality in either the rts or the rpg genre look elsewhere this title fails to meet the quality expectations of a  game in both of the genres it tries to be simultaneouslynever tried the first spellforce so i dont know if it was supposed to be any good
but if the second is any indication i dont think ill bother with finding out
the game tries to be both an rpg and a warcraft style rts
what happens instead is that your characters wander through some hokey maps killing random monsters not very difficult until they stumble across an army that needs to be suppressed
at that point they build the necessary unit factories and march off to war using the same hokey maps
the rpg side of the game is a poor copy of diablo with a similar but relatively useless set of skills
the rts side is equally uninteresting with units that have few redeeming qualities
there is no point in developing any strategy harder than the classic rush em ie
throw everything you got at the bad guy no matter what it is youll win every timegot some what bored with this game after playing it a few daysguess its nice to see if you can improve your speed etc
but its to much over and over 
once in a while it will put on another test  or quiz etc to me its ok for a little while of doing it then it gets to be blahonce you do all the tests then youre done
and theres not that many
it wont record your progress til the next day  youd just have to keep a log of your scores to see if you improve
well to each his own i wasnt impressed with it i wouldnt recommend it as something to play alot of  maybe if you just want to see how you do from time to time not constantlyagain the reviews swade me thoughtit would have a lot of stuff to do to keep me interestedthis game has me thinking there not lot thought how it can be played
mystery at first but then your playing around in mecha and mecha to get around when airships ships and transits of norm still are useable on road
i not certain it was well thought therelot combat in itagainst machines they should give lot chests in here to make it so you can buy lot those customizations on there and items on therepersonally there is evil side or good sideon this game whatsoever
it says on the game you could choose sides and finally decide who you are in end but i doubt itgame has no well thought in music industry it kind sucked if you didnt play well you really never got enough funds to get placesif you played heavily in mecha you would get stuck or behind the story so i going have say two star overall on this game for replayability i wasnt stuck i just was annoyed there was no other options other to play good side and there was no union there just divide and conquer and not befriend everyone ingame of course there was lot of enemies
but too many strange instances where your always grinding i dont think beginner should play this as their first gamethey should understand replayability means to you can go replay all the levels without issue this game has too many tutorials to make person pull out their hairi so hate tutorials and cutscreens there is no cutting it short either
playing goodie too shoes gets boringand tediousplaying hero gets tad boringgraphics are cartoons and blockyto me music was good a while but gets to point where your muting itbig brain academy is a collection of repetitive games that test your memory and vision
you can choose to test yourself or practice
either way the number of game choices is limited  and unlocking practice games is a pain as you need to play the same game in each category over and over even if you score well each time in order to advance
im surprised the other people found this fun
well i got a b on my first test and in a couple days i scored an a  i guess maybe im too smart for this
but i admit i was stupid to have wasted  on the game so i guess im no smartie after alli totally regret buying this game
i bought it thinking itd be more like brainage and even got to play the demo of it but it was totally not what i expected when i got the real game
im totally disappointed bcuz theres not a lot of mind games and im sure everyone scores about the same and the way they score you makes you feel like your stupid
i should of just waited til i found a store that carried brainage instead
that game scores you by the age of your brain not by the weight of your brain
totally not worth your money
if you really wanna play this rent it from blockbuster or something cuz youll get tired of it real quick 
i know i did
ttif you have even an inkling of interest in playing this game let me point out from the start that the designers most likely had this as purely an ipadtouch screen game in mind because it took me a good ten minutes to figure out that i had to hold down the mouse button to move my line of sight
this isnt noted anywhere in the interface notesthough it does point out what the symbols which you cant see if you dont know how to move areand the budget packaging gives no manual presumably because its all so obvious that it needs no mention
boothe rest of the game is bland at best and the first episode made me nauseated from the games quirk of centering then moving to the next section with a fade transition which was aggravated with how apparently the main character cant just walk in a straight line down a hall he slips slightly to the left or right as he goes
there are more than a few places where the game is needlessly longtediousfor instance traversing the thick jungle of the third episode after navigating it even once i ended up having to do it five times
and the decryption puzzles were made miserably difficult because hunt could not hold up the reference material to the object he was trying to translate so after the first such puzzle i just consulted a walkthrough so i could get through it alreadyto get back to the subject apparently there are twelve or so games hunt is looking for but by the third episode hes only found two
are they at least fun games
eh not really
both are capturing games and they have the same problem as chess when it gets down to each player having only a few pieces left it ends up being a stalemate of moving pieces back and forth between safe zones until one player takes a chance
at least once you win you get to play them offline without having to play the main gameon the whole i guess its worth the budget price but definitely disappointing that unless you know what a collection of  complete adventures means theres no indication that this is only a partial narrative
since i had recently watched a cancelled tv show with a similar epic narrative that never concluded i would have preferred going in to know that the disc content ends on a cliffhanger
at least i didnt spend a lot but definitely no fond memories except i guess the beach of madagascar was prettycuando otros juegos de mayor respeto aparecieron ganando terreno rapidamente farcry tuvo ke luchar x su puesto como uno de los favoritos si la competencia no fuese tan ruda aunke siempre lo ser farcry seria el mejor fps del  sin dudo lo fuethis is one purchase i wish i hadnt made or at least i wish id waited for the price to plummet
i had read some of the reviews before buying this one but decided to get it anyway since some of the download sites have stuff that are based on the meshes from this fun stuff pack
that is not looking like such good reasoning nowprossome of the new stuff is actually quite cool especially some of the decorations and wall papers
any quality new variety is welcome hope that made senseconsno bug fixes that i can see
 is way too much for the amount of new stuff provided
this should have been no more than  or included in the upcoming pets expansion along with upcoming glamour life fun packin summary a few nice new objects for an obscene price
someone at ea should be thrown in jail for this robberyoriginally when stuff packs were mentioned as an option in the maxis surveys i was quite excited
the idea of buying a cd chock full of objects sounded like a great deal
but heres my problem
family fun has  objects thats it
for  here at amazon
thats not such a great deal to me
thats  cents per object
i think the face masks the floor globe and the hawaiian clothes are nice
the other stuff is plain icky
i like realistic furniture crayon green hot pink or purple is not my idea of realisticand apparently there are bugs with this stuff pack
if you choose a family fun outfit in createasim the outfit will disappear from the outfit choices
you have to have the sim buy the outfit at a clothing store until the patch comes out
its pretty disappointing that a patch is needed for a stuff packif this pack drops  perhaps then ill think about it
otherwise with the beautiful custom content made by sim fans out there and most kindly shared for free i could easily pass on this packif you like the classic rampage games then youll love this one
they took rampage to a higher level
it has some d look to it
still not allowing you to free roam through a city like war of the monsters does though but it plays like the classics
which is exactly what it was made to do
there are also  different monsters in the game
this is a great game to play and let out your rage
why destroy something small in your house when you can put in rampage and take out a whole city
i am a fan of the old rampage games so i myself really enjoy this gamei remember playing rampage on the nes with my brother  years ago
several versions have come out since then and nothing has changedthe controls are as impricise as it was on the nes
the larger selection of characters are just filler since they all have the same powers
oh yeah and d neighborhoods
no that is total bs
you can move left or right not in or out
how is that d
oh thats right  d characters d buildings in a d world
in my book being able to move left and right means that this game is dif you loved the original it is included or the  version also included this may have some value
if you wanted to check up on a familiar franchise to see how they have changed move onits another king of fighters game
dont we already have enough of these already
its not like this one is drastically different from the other onesits basically the same game as all the other king of fighters but with a  date attached to the title name which means people will notice it realize its brand new and buy it immediately
why do we continue to be tormented like this
in a world already loaded with more than enough tournament fighters i have just this to say find something elseyou have to be a very dedicated flight simulator consumer to get through the difficulties of playing this title
i was very disappointed that i was forced to go through many steps of training before i could start to play the game
all i really wanted was to fly and shoot
i really didnt need a precise accurate simulatorif youre really into detailed airplane operation and behavior this will be a great game for you
the quality of the graphics is great sound is good there are many user controls and settingsso decide before you jump into buying this title
are you willing to spend hours learning intricate controls and go through many training sessions then by all means buy it
if youre like me and just want some fun flying an airplane while shooting at enemy planes then be cautious because the effort involved here is greatthis game has a serious problem with the way they handle the d camera movement more specifically the zaxis vertical orientation
the d camera automatically swings up and down in huge angles when youre in cramped spaces and it really messes up the enjoyment when i cant target the mob im trying to fight and even when im not fighting who wants ordinary exploration to be an exercise of teetertottering your mouse just so you can get a good view
this is true for all guild wars campaigns namely prophecies factions and nightfall
one would think their developers and quality assurance people would have noticed this and flagged this is a serious flaw but it somehow went by ignored
i have played various d games both single player and mmorpg like everquest  i have never seen the d camera angle handled this way
fortunately most of the game terrain is not in cramped and enclosed areas so im guessing thats why they let this glaring flaw slide by but be forewarned that this can cause an inordinate amount of frustration when this issue rears its ugly head at the wrong timein factions more so than the other two campaigns they have made diabolical multitiered maps that zigzag like crazy making it very hard to find certain quest spots
right at the very first spot i started kaineng center it was already apparent that the designers wanted to waste your time so you can run all the way to a spot because the starburst on the map is telling you youre getting close to your target only to find out you are arriving at a dead end and have to traverse all the way back through your original path so you can try an alternate route
im sorry but in my book this is cheesy quests should not be an exercise in trickery and wasting the players time this way
i have played prophecies and nightfall and they werent like that but factions has a place called arborstone which i consider the map from hell
i had a quest there to protect some stone singers and i couldnt get to one area somehow
after more than an hour of running around in circles i just abandoned the quest
arborstone was also the place where the vertical angle swinging problem was really bad because the passageways were enclosed between very high ravine walls and the d camera was just going crazy bobbing up and down by itselfthis is really too bad because the game graphics is excellent better than everquest  best ive ever seen in mmorpg games paralleled only by some of the wellknown singleplayer rpg games eg
elder scrolls titan quest etc
but the game design is inferior in many respects to its competitors
for example the game allows people to group but they frequently end up in disaster because players dont have a good way to synchronize targets
in everquest  clicking a player in the group automatically makes you share his target usually group members must be attacking what the tank is attacking
in guild wars you have to ctrlclick the mob and the chat window will say name is attacking monster name
the problem with this is that it happens a lot where a group of monsters can have two or more of the same kind of monster so the team members can still end up in confusion as to which mob to target
this cannot be underestimated because there are groups that are very powerful that could wipe out your group fast if you dont whittle them down in number fastit is typical among games that quests require you to move around talking to various npcs to complete the quest
but this campaign factions a lot of the quests require you to move a lot and over extensive distances across a multitiered map
frequently id be on the rd level of the map and see my goal shown as a star on the map only to find out it was on the st level groan
it wasnt funguild wars also took the easy way out on typical aspects of mmorpg games
for instance vendors pretty much sell the same stuff over and over in the entire game maybe increasing by one or two items as you progress into more advanced zones
i feel no excitement when i see a vendor in a new zone because i know what to expect
there is also very little variety in terms of weapon and armor stats although they do have a good variety on the looks of armor
there are no player vendors no housing no mounts and a very poor feel of community since you only get to see other human players in town because all zones are instanced meaning you have a copy of the zone for yourself and youll be alone in there with your npc members unless you had invited a friend to explore that zone with you while you were in town
their beast taming is the lamest i have ever seen you can tame warthogs flamingos tigers lions cranes etc real lousy pets im not sure id like to use them to fight demons
you can have only one pet at a time and i am willing to bet that  of the beast tamers which is part of the ranger class dont know how to get rid of their pet because its simply so unintuitiveive been going over the negative things let me say the positives
ive already mentioned their beautiful graphics
they have no monthly fee
the entire game can be downloaded without the need of a cd so you can buy the game from their web site if you want and youll be given a link to start downloading
game is very stable ive never had it crash on me but i guess this can depend on how stable ones pc is too
the looks of the characters were excellently done it may not give you as much berth in customizability as games like elder scrolls but the faces and bodies look attractive and dont look polygonal
the creature artificial intelligence is excellent i have seen mob behavior in this game that ive never seen in any other game
as mentioned prior they do have a great variety of attire which you can mix and match if you want along with the ability to dye them so that people really do look different
each class has its own dance choreography and they are very well done smooth in animation just as all player movements are in the gamencsoft is going to start on guild wars  scheduled to beta on  i guess the flaws on guild wars is way too deeprooted in the framework and very difficult to fix or enhance so they just decided to rewrite and start from scratch
well i hope they do much better this time because if they would just retain their great graphics and add more uncheesy content i do have to admit it is a good feeling moving around in the game because their zones are very artistic and well done except for those with multitiered zigzagging zones that are meant to trick you into taking the wrong waythe only reason i didnt give this game a star is because the graphics are really beautiful and the sceneries are very well done
but it just goes to show that great graphics doesnt make a good gamei am not even going to try it
expansions obviously cant fix my main issues compatibility and server signal strengththe mystery of the mummy was quite possibly one of the most frustrating computer games i have ever played
one would expect in a detective game to be able to interview suspects but there is no one in the game to talk to
holmes simply wanders the mansion searching for items to use to solve various puzzles
and the puzzles
they are nearly impossible to figure out without hints
most of my time was spent pixelhunting trying desperately to find an object that i had read online was needed but that was so well hidden in the dark graphics that i could not find it
the plotline itself was mildly interesting but not well fleshed out and secondary to the tediousness of trying to find items to use on other items to get something else that could be used to fix something else
and so on
a huge disappointmenti have to come out before saying anything about final fantasy xi that ive never played a massivelymultiplayer online rpg before this game
i never gave them a chance because i was scared id play occasionally then become addictedfinal fantasy xi online for the xbox  probably isnt the best game to get an impression on mmorpgs because as both a game and an mmorpg it falls short
as a game its boring
as an mmorpg it just doesnt seem to be as exciting as other ones out therethe first problem i had with this game was the fourhour downloadandinstall time that i had to sit through before i could even think about making a character and playing the game
four hours of letting something installwhat is this 
cmon this is ridiculous
i understand that there are patches and expansions that were added on but i dont care
im not playing a game for four hours im waiting on a menu to leave the screenonce i actually began i came across the biggest fear i had final fantasy xi online gives the player no direction
it simply pops you into an open world and forces you to figure out where to begin
sure this isnt difficult for people who have played final fantasy xi on other consoles for years but a newbie like myself is going to have a lot of problems and something should have been done to accomodate for that
fortunately the ffxi community was mostly nice enough to help me out
some of them laughed at my pathetically low level which was to be expectedfinal fantasy xi onlines gameplay is very stiff
its menubased and has an awful interface one that is more confusing than it should be
in the game the characters move slowly and look like stiff mannequins while attacking and performing any simple action
the world itself is detailed to a minimal amount which is very disappointing
the enemy designs werent all that bad but from a visual perspective ffxi is lackingthe music and sound effects are also pretty bland
even the memorable final fantasy tunes dont sound as comforting as they usually do
like most xbox  games ive played i found myself with the custom soundtrack pumping and overriding the ingame scorei didnt have expectations for final fantasy xi online and its a good thing because id have been disappointed
i can see where the addictive qualities are
its fun to complete missions
its satisfying to level up
its funny to watch a newbie player like myself get killed by the forest hares at the start of the game
but i cant find myself getting into thisi do recommend that anyone looking into this mmorpg try it on the xbox  since it contains the original game and every one of the expansions including the new treasures of aht urghan which was also released on the playstation  and pc
but if youre looking for an xbox  rpg id tell you to pass on thisan extremely slow game that took me hours to make any headway
combat is automatic and restrictive in what actions i could perform based on a cooldown system that prevents players from doing anything beyond basic attacks more than once for certain amounts of real time so i couldnt steal anything from monsters more than once every five minutes
the games presentation can be a mixed bag with slowdown and graphics that are plenty plain by todays standards with only the music standing tall as being noticeably goodi personally found this to be an overall dull game
i did not sit well with the fact that a plodding experience like this is something one pays for especially not how it is on a monthtomonth basis
id rather do something more immediately gratifying or worthwhile like playing an actually fun game or reading
i sincerely hope final fantasy xiv this games onlineonly sequel lives up to its promise to deliver a faster more enjoyable experience and does better for itself and its community
we dont have all the time in the worldmy advices each box of the game have a password therefore you cannot resell or len it if used its online only
you need an broadband internet connection you have to pay a monthly fee    a  gb hard drive will fall short in the meantime you need an usa credit card with local address install it overnight while you sleep because it takes a long time to download the updates and patches not for casual gamers
it will take several hours a day
its like a job
if you have a life of your own you wont enjoy this gameif you like shooters this is one and in some ways it is a fair attempt to be in a ballpark with the other military games
the graphics are not even close and the story and game become a bit of a bore halfway through the gamewow
ive played a lot of games for the past twenty years and ive come across some stinkers
usually a game has no imagination is boring or buggyubersoldier is all those things
i couldnt believe the lack of effort the creators of this piece of scheisse put in
it couldve been interesting with a zombie fps but there is nothing done here which could pass for entertaining or credible
ive seen crappy scifi channel flicks with better plotsthe most atrocious aspect of this game is the voice acting
there have been kindergarten plays with better acting
its heinous
truly truly truly the worst ive ever heardi could go on forever explaining how bad the gameply is poorly designed levels limited weaponry sluggish movement insipid story etcachtung
do not buy or play thisoh dear where do we start
my brother bought me this game on a whim because he found it for four dollars
where did he find it
donno
but apparently four dollars can buy you one hell of a frisbeegraphicsobviously the first impressions of a game are going to be the graphics
being released in  should give you a vague idea of what it looks like
its kind of stuck between current and next generation engines
they just missed the mark
not incredibly bad but no wow factor especially for today
being able to see heat is probably the only notable thing about it
think far cry meets call of duty  actually cod looked better than thisstorylaughable
even for a videogame
i swear a  year old must have written this monstrosity
something about super soldiers rebels and that nazis have to die
i honestly have no idea what it is about
honestly
i think you play as a german in ww but you fight against germans
thats about as much as you are going to get out of it
then they go off and kill off the only character that you found remotely interesting in a weak firefight but i swear you see him later in the game or that may have been someone else i dont know all the character models look the same
but in all seriousness they dont explain anything
its a clusterf of bullgame playrun of the mill fps
you run you gun
you spray you pray
the inventory menu is something like prey where it shows you what weapons you have up top but you can only carry one of a certain type of gun
thats lame
i mean i want the cool heavy machine gun but i only have  bullets for it and i know im not going to find any ammo for the rest of the level
so i have to stick to the gun that every german soldier that i encounter has so i have plenty of ammo but it has terrible aim and i need to unload an entire clip into a guy to bring him down
stupid
just let me carry all the guns
the story is unbelievable enough let me believe that my super soldier can rambo it and carry loads of steel
also the enemy ai is a tad too aggressive
especially when you can spit more accurately than shoot
this is the first fps ive played where aiming down the scope doesnt actually help
you walk into a room or stand in front of a door and you know a handful of baddies are going to run in and they all know exactly where you are
even when you are hiding behind something they pour bullets on top you with pin point accuracy
maybe im supposed to make use of my superpowers or should i say superpower the time shield an interesting concept
by pressing the q button i can put up a blue bubble around my character that stops bullets from reaching me
okay thats pretty neat but give me something else
geebus i was bored with it by the second stage in fact i forgot that i even had it because it only lasts a few seconds before it has to recharge
and whats with the hud
i can understand the health and ammo numbers but whats the blue bar
does that have something to do with my time shield
what are the skulls and symbols for
somebody clue me in on this preferably the developers
and saving dont get me started
i got hella far in a level and had thought that i hit a check point because a small message appeared when i reached a certain area
but when i walked up a stair case some nazis shot something that exploded right next to me killing me instantly
i thought to myself okay thats alright the devs probably just wanted to make it fun by having me learn from my mistakes and retry the area knowing the ambush awaits
however i was pleasantly pissed when i found that i had to restart from the beginning of the level
i shut it off and walked away
i can only take so much crap in one sitting
is it so hard to make an auto save featurelevel designor lack there of
each location is tedious and awful
some doors open up to rooms with absolutely nothing in them no ammo no health pack nothing
just some chairs and maybe a window
they serve no purpose and in these types of games i dont exactly feel like exploring
this beats the doors that dont even open
i normally wouldnt nit pick at that but when the doors that are painted onto the walls look exactly like the ones that do open it gets a little frustrating
change the color put a symbol on it make it flash something
the general layout of each level is either predictable or awkward
narrow alleys maze like complexes long stretches with no cover it never endsaudiothe fx is decent but the voice acting is what i really wanted to rant about
this is some of the no this is the worst voice acting ive ever heard
i would say you need to hear it to believe it but i hope you dont subject yourself to this game in order to find out
just take my word
it lacks emotion proper casting and general talent
some say that it is on par with far cry but i respectively disagree
its so far below and i thought far crys voice overs were awful
i cringe every time the protagonist speaks and the female lead does a wonderful job at making me laugh with every line
the nazis dont help either
they sound remarkably like americansbottom line this game is not worthy of your time nor hard drive space
even if it were gifted to you i would say it could be used for something else like replacing that sugar packet that stabilizes your kitchen tablei was really looking forward to the sequal to the longest journey
although in longest journey there were many long long conversations the storyline was enjoyable and movement uncomplicated
unfortunately dreamfall is disappointing
first of all the movement through the game is difficult using the computer controls
it is easy to be trapped in a situation because of this movement
also there is combat
i was looking for another game which utilized strategy and puzzle solving
unfortunately there are silly combat scenes which distract from the game playing and are frustrating to a player like myself who is not interested in an arcade type gamethe positive aspect of the game is the graphics which are superbapparently from the other reviews i have read they have left the story hanging at the end in order for a sequel to be made
im not sure i would be interested due to the negatives i refer to earlieri am pretty far into this game hopefully at least halfway and i think ive played it plenty long enough to give a fair reviewso far the story is vague and disjointed enough that its often hard to tell whats going on
maybe it all comes together in some fabulous way at the end but im getting to the point where im tired of waiting for answers and pretty much dont care whats happening any morethe gameplay is mostly terrible
the itemcollection puzzles are very easy as there are only ever a couple items in inventory at a time
the shapematching type puzzles are okay but nothing special
and then there are the stealth and fighting areas which are some of the worst gaming ive ever seen
they are simplistic and boring at best horribly frustrating and offputting at worstyes the graphics and voice acting are pretty excellent but i really have to compare dreamfall to other recent adventure games such as the syberia series which are pretty but have almost no gameplay value whatsoever
there are definitely a few moments where the plot is novel and interesting but theyre just barely worth playing for
i cant wait to finish it and be done with this gamewell after waiting for such a long time for a sequel
this is not the genius the first one was
to much running away fighting and pc play was extremely difficult
sorry not my choice for a good sequeldreamfall starts off as a promising sequel to the longest journey
the visuals are great and even at high settings they dont slow down a decent system
the voice acting is excellent as well
the camera is generally tolerable
the game immediately feels more like an interactive movie than a pointandclick adventure game but this is initially a welcome break from the previous game
the longest journey had still d screens to explore but dreamfall is a d world that begs to be explorednow for the bad news
first you cant fully explore the world
many objects and doors that you encounter are simply there for decoration or for your character to make an inane and irrelevant comment about
the game also attempts a kind of combat that is clunky and unsophisticated it adds nothing to the game
to make things worse that interesting story that opens the game begins to deteriorate and fragment fairly quickly
the writers were trying to pull off a tour de force when they should have focused on developing an intelligent script and plot
the story simply gets out of hand
there are too many characters and motivations and they pass by so quickly that its difficult to care much about the later characters or anything that happens to them
the dialogue also becomes irritating repetitious irrelevant and the voice acting likewise degrades
the disappointing ending to the game feels like someone on a deadline ran out of time
theres actually no game play for the last twenty minutes of the game  its all dialoguei was also turned off by the amount of makeup on the protagonist zoe and april ryan
they have more eyeliner and mascara than a streetwalker
this might be believable on zoe who is a young cute woman and may not be able to make herself up appropriately yet but april is older and lives in the middle of a swamp where it isnt likely that makeup is a priority for survival
at any rate these ugly character designs were a distractionfinally the puzzles you would expect in an adventure game are neither difficult nor interesting although a few of them are tedious and dumbi had a good feeling about this game for the first hour or two
then it just tanked
i hope they abandon this storyline for the next game and start over
this one is not worth continuingi resend my original review
after completing the game i can tell you it is a masterpiece of art
the puzzles are extremely easy but the artwork in the game is of the highest qualitythe controls are bad if you do not have a game controller
if you have a game controller then the controls are easy as with most gamesits great and i now give it  starsi wont lie to anyone
the game looks as good as any other re game made
it looks great
but the controls system is the worst system ive ever used
i bought it for the pc because everyone knows that shooters work best on pc
gamepads arent accurate and a mouse is the way to gothere are no control mapping abilities in the main menu
when you go to the controls screen it only allows you to invert the aiming and switch aiming preset keysthe book is no better
it says what each key does but the game will tell you to run by pressing 
 has nothing to do with running
the right ctrl button controls running
i found out the game meant enter
i kept pressing it and then while running it said press 
 again have nothing to do with what it wants you to do
i tried the number keys and the keypad
i tried finding what  meant on a keypad and use those keys on the keyboard
nothing happened
i cant go any farther since i keep dieingthe website has zero help in the matteri agree with the other rater that said the box lies and says a mouse is compatible
yeah rightgreat graphics  baaad gameplayi bought this for my psp so that if i was traveling with the kids they could play it as opposed to their leapster
well it is too difficult for them and for me as an adult it is my last choice
for a  year old it is probably good i just cant rate it high for myself or my kidsthose are the only two pros of this game
if you want to play the classic nes mario games on your ds then buy this
if you want a challenge or something new and different then do not buy this
you will be sorely disappointedthis is the same stale gameplay that plagues many generic platformers today no matter what console
just because it is mario does not make it any better
the worlds themselves are mostly recycled with some variances from super mario   the boss battles are exactly the same
the only time the touch screen is even used for the gameplay is if you want to use the power up you have savedwith the incredible potential this game had it is wasted on rehashing the old nes games with better graphics
once again buy this only if you want a portable nes mario game
everyone else stay awaymicrosoft games has proven they can make excellent rts games
my two favorite rtses age of empires  and rise of nations were built by themlike many i bought this game because i adored rise of nations
i knew itd be different but wow i did not expect this
the gameplay is completely different
the removal of gathering different types of resources is discouraging
the three teams are relatively uninspired
graphically its beautiful but great gameplay is infinitely superior to good graphicsthe game is not inherently bad but it isnt very good especially considering all of microsoft games potential and the high expectations for this gamei was not impressed with the reviews and the game features when this game first came out so i delayed buying until now in order to pay less
i was expecting a rise of nations game but with fantasy factions
when i first played i was bemused and was barely able to figure it out
on my second attempt i played an easy scenario and got to the latter end of the tech tree so to speak
i must say the resource gathering city construction and technology advancement actually grew on me and i enjoyed my  second game
the graphics are fairly decent and the eye candy is appealing
looking down the line i already know that the game will become tedious because unlike rise of nations it lacks any sort of epoch system and thus units are a slight variation of the ones previously available
i was also very unimpressed with the scenario editor
maybe i need more time to get used to it but the first time i used it it crashed
it is not a patch on the original rise of nations editor from my experience
the editor seems over complicated and more programmer friendly than gamer friendlystopped playing after  the way through
why bother
i have consistenly not liked the ms games anyway so i guess i should not have been surprised
there are many with opinions contrary to mine so i guess my best adivce is to see if there is a demo and if so download an play it first
maybe it will suite your tasteshail flaviusi really wanted to give this game a chance
i really did
it looked very nice visually in the screenshots released
but unfortunately there was an utter failure to deliver
the concept of one single linked city was nice
ill give it that
however the core mechanics of the game units etc were horrible
i would have to say they were even less creative than those of some of microsofts older games such as age of empires etc
so in addition to the game mechanics feeling clunky they also felt outdatedbasically overall the story wasnt that good the units were uninteresting to say the least and given the multitude of other options and i really wish i could have had those hours backon the upside it is very lovecraftian
original graphics
but not much investigating going on
no need to read clues just start shooting the badguys open doors pull levers to solve the same gay puzzles on every other game and on and on an on without any development in the plot
innsmouth is less like a town and more like a straight alley
start here do this then go here then do this and only afterward can you do the next thing which is just like the last thing you did and shoot up all the citizens of innsmouth
the initial getaway level is decent
the citizens are breaking in and you go room to room and out the window and across rooftops but after that the whole game is downhill
i recommend clive barkers undying
instead
its not very investigative either but it feels like more of an adventure and its just as creepyyou are dead
you will see this screen over and over and over again
you cant skip the many cutscenes so you will have to sit through the same ones over and over again
you cant save so you have that to add to the frustrationin only the second level of this game called attack of the fishmen you will want to hurl this game straight into the trashcan
so very frustrating
you are forced to quickly lock doors behind you in several spots open windows and make perfect jumps while being chased
you must do all this without any slight error in timing at all
there are no saves in this game except for checkpoints in other areas so you will repeat these types of scenes over and over and overthis game also has a strange feature that you cant turn off in the options
the main character evidently has a panic attack constantly which makes the sceen constantly go blurry with a loud beating heartbeat
this blurriness makes it down right impossible sometimes to make the many jumps required
it also makes you wonder if this guy chose the right career path or maybe he left his blood pressure meds at home
it is very distractingthe game is also very linear with cutscene after cutscene
there are so many cutscenes it feels like you are watching a movie sometimes instead of playing a game
the forced timed action sequences should never be in a game without a proper save functionthe two games i would recommend as an alternative bridge commander and starfleet command  are both near impossible to find nowadaysyou know that you are in trouble when the pc game recommends the controller for the console it was ported from  and when you find ai files from star trek armada dated  in the installation directoryit is difficult to change the control settings for novice users
there is no ingame menu to do such  you are required to edit a file in notepadtextpad to do thisthe graphics settings constantly reset themselves if you try to edit the config files to actually make the game look decentthere is little to no tactical depth you can warp right in to planetsasteroids and it does no damage to your ship
there is no factor in a battle beyond your ships stats versus whoever you are fightings stats  so the bigger ship wins alwaysit would have been nice to run into an asteroid field as the defiant  zigzagging among asteroid while the romulan warbird chasing you ends up getting plowed by an asteroid because of its sluggish controls  weakening it enough so that you can turn and do some damage while it is hurtinstead it follows you in shrugs off all the asteroids and then kills you in  seconds because you cannot warp out of the asteroid fieldshield facings are irrelevant so no tactical decisions there
the only relevance and it is small is the range you are before you open up with phasersthere is excellent sound and voiceovers in this game but it does not save the trainwreck that it has become
i was expecting a lot more and i wish the extended development time and multiple pushbacks of my shipping here at amazon were used to improve the programming not sticking with header files from a  game instead of just recording voiceoversit would be nice if the developer opened up the game for modding teams to save
asis i think that mad doc spent more time on the intro movie advertising their company than they did on the gameshameanother disappointment
another casualty of the console driven push for style over substancefirst understand that this is a shooter light on the tactical
if you are expecting an adventure or the depth of say bridge commander or even starfleet command you are in for a surprise
the voices of five captains are all you get as far as frills go
you will never see them
you will never see cutscenes
there is no bridge view
you get a map and the standard space view and that is all you will ever see with the exception of the menuthe graphics are lovely for the most part but seem to carry with them unrealistic system requirements
i far exceed the suggested system yet my game stuttered in the strangest seemingly least demanding places
i chalk this up to poorly optimized code
audio static and skipping was heard at the main menu and during playback of the extras which stuttered as well while the bulk of the game ran smoothlycontrols are an unresponsive nightmare minimal and cannot be changed
word on the official forums is to use an xbox  controller 
 im sorry but i find this insulting and proof positive that this is a console port
 controller buttons are even mentioned in the manuali never did try multiplayer before uninstalling but a patch has quickly been released to allow people to connect i suppose
i think its worth bringing up here that it took almost ten minutes to uninstall
all of these issues lead me to believe the game was rushedstill even in full working order this would not be the star trek experience i had hoped to have
this is a shooter
very plain and very simpleeven so it worries me that pc gamers are seeing more and more of these rush jobs more and more of these console ports that promise cutting edge graphics and little else
even if this game worked out of the box it would still lack soul depth and creativitysadly bridge commander is still the game of choice for meprosthere are xmen in this game wolverine iceman and nightcrawlericemans levels are pretty good hence the  starsthe voices of the actors in the movie are used which may have cost so much is explains the consconsonly  decent cutscene in the whole game and all curscenes are drawn like moving comic pages like putting a comic in front of your face and impersonating an xmen characterwolverines levels are poor he has about  different moves only and hes the worst part of the entire game
nightcrawlers levels are just frustrating and should not be played if you are tired of life in any waythere is no comparison between this game and class games like xmen legends they both begin with x comparison abruptly endsyou may be thinking i love xmen im buying this anyway
buy  enjoy as much as  possible but you have been warnednot always is a game based off a movie bad
there really are some good ones out there
however there are some that truly are bad and should be avoided
xmen the offical game is that game
the game overall is pretty poor
the developers didnt seem to take it seriously
the game is meant to connect the second xmen movie with the third one
unfortunately the game just reeks of bad quality
perhaps if it had spent more time in development the game couldve been good
instead its rather blandthe game begins with a training mission with each character
this is simply to get you adjusted to the gameplay mechanics
later on youll come to see these training missions are just a waste of time
playing the game is already simple as can be
afterwards you go back to alkali lake as nightcrawler and recover parts of cerebro
afterwards youll be given a choice between which scenario you wantthroughout the entire game youll only get to play as three characters
wolverine iceman or nightcrawler
each of them have their own abilities and their own scenarios
once you pick one character youre stuck with them until their scenario is over
you wont really run into the other playable characters a lot though
neither are the scenarios very hard or excitingxmen is pretty much a simple beat em up game with little bits and pieces of story thrown in for good measure
the story isnt really impressive though
its hard to follow and the game doesnt put an emphasis on it
what voice acting there is isnt so bad
at least the voices that come from the stars of the film
youll recognize them instantly
those who arent voiced by celebrities dont sound all that great
the story also unfolds mostly through storyboards rather than cinematicsbut what emphasis there is on gameplay is simplistic and mediocre
all youve got to do is beat people up
you might have to open a door or something but thats about it
it isnt that the game is a beat em up that frustrates me
its that theres nothing more to it than button mashing
and there arent a lot of combos to perform either
as i said its simplisticoutside of beating up your enemies you may have to telport as nightcrawler
nightcrawler does have a healing ability and so does iceman but im quite sure they didnt have one before
icemans levels are a little more interesting than the others seeing as how his are constantly moving along
the bulk of the game however is simply beating up your enemies
and as i mentioned there isnt a whole lot of variety to beating them upthere are moments when the game can be hard
well frustrating actually
the game doesnt provide a lot of difficulty but it does provide you with having to charge at your enemies head on toyou guessed itbeat them up
youll have to run through bullets to get to most of them and that can be a little annoyingboss fights arent really exciting either
those consist of you performing a simple little dash and hit sort of pattern most of the time
they have predictable patterns and dont really do a whole lot to get you
again this makes the game rather easywhere the game really hits a low point are the graphics
there are some glitches that might make you question the graphics
for example you can knock an enemy into a wall and theyll get stuck there unable to get out of it and unable to damage you
sometimes enemies will pop up out of no where and theres no explanation
if these sorts of things only happened once or twice i wouldnt mind
but they dont
they happen numerous times and constantly
i wish i could say the game looks good but for the xbox it looks rather lame
its a bit more colorful than the regular xbox version but it looks disturbingly identical in all respects
so if youve got the regular xbox it really isnt all that differentits also rather annoying that the character selection is only limited to three characters
there couldve been more characters than just wolverine nightcrawler and iceman
they each play a little differently but theyre the only three characters
thats rather disappointingthis is nothing more than a cash cow game
its nothing but a beat em up game with little variety
if it had spent more time in development it probably wouldve been a better experience overall
there are better games out there
ones with a bit more quality than this
i cant recommend this one
not at allthis is a good game but way too realistic i mean no cross hairs u die fast characters are slow and stiff if i wanted so much realism i would join the marine corp i just want to play a game this is stupidoriginal review  i wish i had purchased this device from the beginning instead of the usbtocontroller charger
this thing charges fast allows for the simultaneous charging of two batteries and a light indicator lets you know when the batteries are fully charged
now this may be a plus or a minus depending on who you talk to but it plugs in to a wall outlet and not the usb slot on the console
i look at that as a plus as i have many near by wall outlets and like to leave my usb ports open for other possible peripheral
that said the product comes with the cord charging station and a spare battery for under 
its a great deal
update  so after about  year of owning this thing and maybe using it two dozen times it has shorted out
id like to lower the rating to  stars simply because microsoft has produced yet another shoddy product in my eyes
yet another waste of money on my partafter a few weeks of use the right charging bay stopped working
i find this rediculous because it is a xbox brand
i would be skepticil about buying this againtwo star game five star fun
how does that work
now to begin the only reason im giving this game two stars is because it is warning to people who have no clue like i didnt what this game is
i was at the store looking to buy san andreas but they didnt have it so i opted for this one title now dont get me wrong this is still gta material but this and vice city stories is a remake of the psp version into the ps version which to me it doesnt quite work
the fun is still there but the graphics arent as good and the movement arent as crip which after playing vice city i had raised the bar high for gta
like i said this game isnt bad if you know what youre buying but if you dont have a clue id suggest you rent it first to see what youre gettingthis game is not a full fledged game like virtua tennis
it is fun to play with others thats about it
there is no shelf life for this game
gets repetitive and boring very fast
they should have thought about modes minigames and other stuff
rent or borrow and play it for couple of days
buying it is not worth iti purchased this headset after the one that came with the xbox broke  do not buy this headset buy an overear one
this one is hard to get into your ear very uncomfortable and goes so far into your ear and gets covered by my brothers ear wax  also the mic is not that sensitive and my  friends can not hear a thing i say online
you cant even bend the mic towards your mouthdo not buy it
get an overear version
this is an updatejust yesterday the mic started going bad
my voice is fuzzy  i wish i could give this a negative ratingonce again do not get this headseti was so looking forward to this title
it looks good but runs very badly even with a m card
the controls are really bad
i turned the sensitivity down to zero on the joystick and still cant keep from crashing into everything in sight
forget about winning a race
i also had to turn the graphics way down to even make it playable
this was such a great title what the heck happened
and whats with the  discs
watch out theyve flat out taken the fun out of flatout too badsuperman returns did you notice flying dragons destructive robots flying saucers and monsters in the movie
no
this game has you continuously and i mean that very much fight against these creatures
you have to destroy them with heat vision freeze breath or basic attacks over and over again
then once in a while you get to fight metallo multiple guy bizarro
again you use heat vision or basic punches kicks grapple moves to defeat themdoes this sound like the movie
no
the only connection to the movie that this game has are the cutscenes
once in a while there will be lois typing on the computer someone tossing a newspaper with the headlinesuperman defeats 
i was hoping for a connection to the movie like spiderman  had
but nothingfreedom
never
yes you get to fly around metropolis which looks nice but then every minute you are stopped by an emergency
time to extinguish buildings defeat monsters or villains and just make sure metropoliss health bar doesnt reach zero
thats it
the end of the game has something new
stop a storm
yay
well after the third time you do this it is no longer any fun
no visits to the fortress of solitude
no major conversations between supermanlois supermanlex or clarklois
you dont get to save lois
the cutscene does that for youso does this seem like the game they promised
the fighting is ridiculously repetitive
it has spiderman s xp
you fight the baddies and gain xp
then you move onyou do not get to fight lex luthor
the cutscene does that
anyway the graphics are good but the gameplay is horrible
barely any connection to the movie
no freedom
no romantic plot with lois
there isnt even james marsdens character
theres no superman jrif you want freedom a beautiful city a connection to a movie flying high above buildings saving people  then buy spiderman  at least there you fight the villains in the movie save mj and race the black catplease  rent before you buythis game is terrible
this game has nothing to do with the superman returns movie accept for the voice overs
it just an annoying copy of spiderman  which was the original free raomingsandbox videogame
the bosses and enemies are tedious and annoying
the combos are way to complicated and you have a health meter which is stupid because superman is invincible
the bosses are way to hard and this game had a small budget
the graphics are terrible and this game will freeze your  badly
i returned it got another disc and that disc was defective too
instead of superman buy marvel ultimate allianceoh how i looked forward to this game
i followed through screen shots and trailers that were released
i also accepted the delay when ea said they were tightening up the game quality
man i would have hated to see it before they tightened up the quality
like another reveiwer said there is great potential for this game that ea failed to find
for one yes the game is terribly short
that may be good or bad depending on how you feel about the game in general
you can beat this game within  hours
the game was fun for the first hour or so and i still enjoyed playing it just for the feel of flying around
ea caught that pretty good
if you ever played the spiderman games just to feel the sensation of swinging through the city you may have more tolerance for this superman game
i bought this the day it came out before the reviews came out
had i waited i would have only rented this gamethe game loosely and i mean loosely follows the plot line of the movie
one of the coolest moments in the movie was when superman had to rescue the jet liner
i would have thought for sure this could have made it into the game but alas it wasnt to be
i would have been happier if ea could have followed the movie plot more than just throwing in repetitive boss fights that happen again and again and again and again
i hope you see the point in reiterating again and again
you cant even really just enjoy flying around the city without a fight beginning
i dont even consider the graphics to be worthy of a second generation game for the  not with titles like gears or war or the incredible rainbow six vegasif you are a true hardcore fan of superman then i recommend a rental and if you could care less about superman just plain stay away from this game
i play it still just to have the freedom to fly around but i normally switch to another game as soon as the fights start upi have never been a huge ea fan
i felt that need for speed most wanted was a great game
aside from that ea has always been a mid quality publisher and developer
i consider the top games to come from ubisoft
just look at madden when ea got the exclusive contact with the nfl there went the competition and madden is now the only nfl licensed game out there and the lack of competition means you get the same pitiful game year after year now
i think ea has gotten to big for the pants and should focus more on game quality than just shipping out game after game
hey it works for ubisoft
also if you want to see how ea is only interested in making the money just check out battlefield  lolas for superman there is a great game hidden under the trash that ea made available
maybe next time someone other than ea can have the chance to make a great superman gameand this is not a positive
let me state i am a superman fan
he is my all time fave
this game had a kind of sweet trailer for those that remember that came out around the time of the movie trailer
it looked like they may finally get a superman game rightwell not so much
although the flight of supes is kind of captured the game play kind of sucks
starting with an odd series on krypton which take a little getting used to and can be difficult
you must beat this level to get to metropolis which is where the real fun of light occurs
however once in metropolis its the same action  fighting robots or lex bots
it is kind of lame just like superman returns the movie
thats about it
what is interesting to mesuperman returns would have probably been more satisfying had he spend  minutes fighting robots and lex bots in metropolis
and conversely this game might have been more interesting had it followed the movie plot with more ability to freely roam the cityunfortunately the closest anyone has come yet to capturing what it must be like to be superman is lego batman  which even throws in the john williams score
id skip this onekeeping with the tradition set by superman  superman returns is a bad game
really bad
super bad
stay awaymost gamers hold a certain prejudice against movie games
games like superman returns supports the assumption they are all bad
this may be better than superman  but it still feals like a half hearted noeffort attempt
its been a few months since ive played it and ive done my best to forget everything about it but what i do remember is that  its awful and  its really weirdeverything in superman returns is mediocre and repetitive
graphically
as a game
its a lot of cut and paste
youll find yourself doing the same missions over and over no matter what chapter youre on
fighting the same enemies
in a city populated with buildings that have been shamelessly copied and pasted everywhere
trying to do mundane tasks like grabbing the hidden kittens is a nightmare because the city all looks the same and missions will randomly decide to start just as youre about to grab a cat
it makes for a very miserable not fun experience
superman says it best himself when he delivers a here kitty kitty in the most lethargic somebody put me out of my misery expression possiblethe other really weird thing about superman returns is its a movie tie in
as in it should be based on the movie
strangely as you play and advance the story youre occasionally treated to a cutscene with lex luthor following the exact same plot as it exists in the movie
outside of that
nothing at all to do with the movie
nothing
so what does the game have you do
fight robots
metallo is featured a lot in the game
put out burning buildings
fight dragons dragons
what
fight aliens
and thats about it
repeating ad nauseum until you reach the chapter finale mission only to have it start all over again for the next chapter
it makes playing superman returns difficult
there are games that are difficult because they are hard
then there are games that are difficult because they do such a good job of making you hate playing it so much you want to stop which is what superman returns does so well
i was nearly in tears begging for the game to end six hours in
theres no fun to be found in this game
not even if you want to try and grief citizensif youre thinking about buying this game because hey
easy achievements
forget it
it takes effort for them
theres an achievement for playing a certain number of hours
you may think that would be the last one to get right
nope
took me  more hours of flying around in a circle for the distance flown achievement
made me thankful for the invention of tape and rubberbands
i should also mention the game is buggy
kinda good and kinda bad
my first time playing i had a few cats disappear on me and i was absolutely dreading the thought of playing the game again not kidding im not easily frightened but the prospect of playing through again had me terrified but thankfully progress is shared between game saveswhere to begin
let me start by saying that ever since we were treated to et on atari with rare exception moviebased games have generally been pretty awful
the reason for that is simple a developer knows that a products name will entitle it to a certain number of sales just because of the name
theres no extraincentive for you to inflate the budget of a product if you dont expect to recoup that dollar amount in sales
superman returns i really thought wasnt going to fall into that developer trendmy expectations were raised oddly enough when the game was delayed and the demo was released
superman was originally supposed to come out in may of  to coincide with the release of the feature film
when it was delayed i mistakenly thought that was the staff at ea saying to itself ok theres more interest here then we thought lets sink a little more time and effort into this one
the game was subsequently pushed to november to match up with the films dvd release
then the demo for the game hit xbox live and i was legitimately impressed
metropolis was huge the environment was interactive the flight mechanics were solid it reminded me of ultimate spiderman just with superman
the graphics and the combat system were a little belowaverage but i wrote that off as a problem theyre working on
it was just a demo after all i expected it to be a little rough around the edgeswhile nothing that i enjoyed about the game was changed im disappointed to say that none of these issues i had were fixed for the games final release either
not to mention theres very little to the game outside of the demo i played
instead of using the extra time ea took to get superman released to add content ea seemed to just seem to multiply what was there already
just for example there isnt enough diversity in the enemies superman will confront
you fight metallo and his minions fairly early in the game
youll be fighting those same annoying robots the whole game
there are only about five or six actual boss fights in the game none of whom i found particularly difficult
one of which is the same character twice
id have loved to have seen more of supes rogues gallerythere arent many side missions you have to distract yourself with either
it would have been awesome to involve more of supermans supporting cast to pass along side objectives
as i said before theres not more diversity its as if they just doubled what was already thereas far as the previous superman games go this is definitely king of the hill
some of those games were flatout awful this is at least playable
its just that i wish they took the nugget of a good thing they had going and fleshed it out a lot more
for now its nothing more then a  could of been
rent it if you want to check it outthe game is a disappointment to say the least
the entire game consist of beating the same enemies to advance to the next chapter
theres no real missions in this
no objectives other than beating up random enemiesnow if your a superman fan you may enjoy playing as superman doing all these things with his powers
the powers are pretty fun but thats all there isi dont think they depict his strength very well in the hand to hand combat either
he must throw cars at enemies to most of the times to kill themi am a superman fan so its worth the  bucks i spent
i wouldnt buy it if i wasnt a hardcore fan
so im giving it a  not as a superman fan but just giving the game what i feel it deserves interms of quality overall for gamers in generalthis headset is better than the one the comes from microsoft but its still not greatit does what it is supposed to do
i can talk through it on xbox live and hear othersthe main problem is that these headsets are not made to last
this one snapped after a few months
i tried to tape it up but it was uncomfortableget some turtle beach headsets
they are quality last a long time and are worth it for games like cod
i am glad i did because i kept wasting money on the cheap plastic onesthis item was working great until people on the other side of the gaming world could not hear my son
he can hear them but the mic on this item gave out
i already tried to fix it by jiggling the wire but it just doesnt work anymore
it probably worked for about  months weekends only because my son is not allowed to play on school nightscame as described and sooner than it was supposed 
most def will buy from this seller again  game was fun but really hard to play i thoughtgreat graphics nearly impossible to follow levels  theyre not hard just its hard to figure out whats next
very little help is given you just end up restarting levels and heading off in different directions hoping to find what your supposed to dothis is alot like mechwarrior if you take all the cool things about mechwarrior and either removed them ir significantly complicated them into a list of muddled messesthis game plays like a brain tumor
it just badthe controls are awful and even once you get used to them the camera controls never seem intuitive or usefulthe process if personalizing your mech sorry hound is more like analyzing a spreadsheet of data than it is like equipping a missile launcher its borderline indecipherable from just making the player perform multivariate calculus in their head while listening to bad electronicindustrial musicthe missions  are more like trials of tribulation that you not so much complete as you master since you will undoubtedly play them over a dozen times before you decipher the actual meaning of the briefingobjectives and fugure out what all the novel symbols on the abortion of a map they provide you with meanavoid
at
all
costsafter watching the commericals i thought the playbility was like the gta series
not quite
it is like risk with drugs
i am disappointed in this game
lots of cussin and movie clips then a risk like game board
then more cussin and movies then back to the risk board
mega boring however i should have know this when i saw the sierra games logo
that is the universal gaming logo for wait until it hits the dollar binbottome line not recommended for folks that like gta like playabilitycontrols are alrightthere are  skins for each character and each skin can be vastly customized
except customization cost a ton of there are a couple different modes like survival and arcade but other than that the game gets so repetitive
dont get me wrong its fun but the fun fades really quick
i just wish there was more to do in the gameunless you are a hardcore fan or you are insanely in love with psp fighters dont buy ita freeroaming sandbox game where you play as the ever popular man of steel in a fully explorable metropolis with lots of bad guys to beat up
sounds too good to be true right
well apparently it is
perhaps if superman returns wasnt a tiein to the movie of the same name it wouldnt have been such a disappointment but sadly that seems to be the norm for these kinds of video games
seriously the only games that didnt suffer from that trend were the ones based off the spiderman movies maybe activision is better at planning things out with the movie studios
anyway this game had a great setup and premise you play as superman through the events of the movie sort of with all his available powers including true invincibility
thats right in this game superman is just as invulnerable as he is in the comics and movies therefore he possesses no health meter however the city of metropolis is indeed very vulnerable and does have a health meter
true to form its supermans job to protect metropolis from being destroyed by his enemies that means defeating the bad guys before they empty out the citys health by destroying vehicles light poles and other parts of the landscape
as interesting as this sounds on paper it just didnt work out in reality
the enemies superman faces need only take out a few cars about four or five in order to empty metropoliss health down to half so defeating enemies quickly as they appear on supermans radarcompass is crucial
unfortunately groups of enemies mostly robots and aliens from what i saw in my one hour playthrough pop up so frequently that its practically impossible to keep up and these groups often appear at the same time as other groups just blocks away pretty much just like the random crimes in the later game spiderman web of shadows
so while youre dealing with one group of enemies the other group has already emptied out about ninety percent of the citys health
plus if superman grabs any of the aforementioned cars or light poles and throws them at his enemies which he does all the time in the comics all he does is make it easier for the bad guys to empty out the citys health meterin a way this game is the opposite of the incredible hulk ultimate destruction since its all about keeping any form of destruction down to a minimum
what the developers for this game should have done was ignore the property damage and have the citys health meter lower itself only if too many civilians get killed that may sound cruel but it makes more sense
picture it wounded citizens would have separate meters over their heads that empty out the longer they remain wounded and superman can grab them and either quickly fly them to a hospital or set them down away from the battle zone and take them to the hospital or a nearby ambulance after the enemies have been destroyed
if supes takes too long and the citizens die from their wounds then some of the citys overall health would go down a bit
again spiderman web of shadows does something similar to this and thats what this game should have done
it would have forced the player to act quickly and think strategically by deciding when it was time to move civilians to safety or when it was time to take out enemies as fast as possible in order to prevent further loss of life
the games graphics were somewhere between better than spiderman  but inferior to ultimate destruction
the characters appear a little too small and lack detail and while metropolis itself is enormous it doesnt look all that impressive
in fact it all looks the same pretty much everywhere you go lots of tall white and pointy buildings
the fighting and movement controls were okay but could have been more fluid
its pretty fun to slam enemies repeatedly on the ground and shoot them with heat vision but these moves quickly lose their flair after doing them the first ten times so more fighting combos would have been a good idea
one thing this game did do well was the implementation of supermans flight you get quite a rush making superman fly beyond supersonic speed through the air with the wind blowing past him in a defeaning roar
however as awesome as the flying was it wasnt enough to save this game from its many other flaws
i dont suggest anyone buy or even rent this game except maybe the more loyal and obsessive superman fans who will no doubt be able to look past this games many flaws and appreciate it simply for what it is a video game starring their favorite superhero
its a shame with more time developing the controls and creating a better balance in regards to how frequently random enemies appear and how vulnerable metropolis is against these enemies this game could have been awesomesuperman as a character in a video game hasnt worked yet for  main reason superman himself can move in any direction at any time
getting this to work realistically and properly in a video game whereby the user has full and perfect control is daunting to say the least
when flying fighting etc its nearimpossible to move around successfully with good control
you just sort of hope for the best that you dont hit all those cars or burn all those people
also superman has a lot of powers and getting these to work intuitively is a diffcult task as well
this game tries a lockon approach which really isnt as helpful as youd think
gameplay is weak too theres no real plot
you just sort of save the city over and over and over again
its not that much fun
graphics suffer too in that because you are superman you can move with incredible speeds so that when you move from spot to spot the buildings still better look good when you get there
the graphics in this game are weak to compensate for this very pointlets reviewgo anywhere in metropolis right away exploring the first openworld game that extends from the street all the way into the atmosphere so what  the graphics are weak because of this very point
plus there really isnt much to do in this openworld game
its a pretty boring world
nonlinear gameplay and innovative flight rescue and combat mechanics let you create your own experience  over and over and over and over again
nonlinear is right but its still the same thing repeatedly
play through missions inspired by over  decades of superman stories plus filminspired events with voiceovers by brandon routh kate bosworth and kevin spacey  some of these missions are entertaining but quickly become tiresome
hey at least we got spaceys voice in a videogame finally
master and upgrade supermans unique powers  like superman normally would right
wrong
upgrading is the only way they could tiein some sort of achievement into the game
supermans success depends on metropolis health  so tedious to keep saving the town over and over again
argrent it
youll see what i meanwell i learned my lessonnever ever buy a video game before reading reviews from magazines and fans
had i done that i would have saved myself  on superman returns
supermans history on video games has been pretty abysmal and this game does nothing to change the poor track record
first of all despite the title this game has little to do with the film it is named after
lex luthor does make an appearance barely and superman will find himself battling villains like bizarro and metallo
that is just the beginning of this maddening game experienceyou get to use supermans powers like flight superspeed heat vision superbreath and frost breath
only the heat vision is really useful in battle
superbreath just blows your enemies backwards with minimal or no damage
theres also several combo attacks that you begin with and gain throughout the game but the best attacks seem to be the simplest ones such as just grabbing a guy and hurling him into a nearby wall or slamming him on the groundfirst i really hate the controls
while it may be fun to soar around the skies above metropolis the control is clunky
trying to fight while flying is a royal pain
it starts with zooming around trying to save metropolis from a meteor storm
youll still be flying around trying to find the meteors as they crash down on the city and this is all on the first level
its also damn near impossible to control superman when running at superspeed as you go crashing into buildingsnext your transported to monguls warworld
what this has to do with superman returns i have no idea other than explaining supermans five year absence from the earth
here youll battle various gladiators in monguls arena including a maddening guy named outcast who changes size from mansize to gigantic
when in giant form he can only be hurt by throwing objects at him while he sends waves of energy out in a full circle at you
superman
nopeyoull have to grab an object then quickly run away to avoid his blasts and hope to have a two second opening to hurl your projectile at him
supermans health bar is actually a favored gladiator bar
i never did figure out this thing
my bar was going down even when i wasnt being hit
i guess the crowd didnt like my duck and running for cover in between trying to find an object to throw
making it worse there is so much clutter in the arena that half the time you throw something it never makes it to the target because it hits something else
it is frustrating beyond all belief
to top things off once your health expires you have to start the whole stinking thing over even after defeating several foes easilythe game on the ps doesnt really look so goodyes metropolis is huge to explore but who would want to
theres no character to the buildings really you cant go inside structures making the whole setting lifeless
the music
the music is okfairly dramatic an all but guess whatthat familiar john williams superman theme is no where to be found
what a disappointmentthere is just nothing much to recommend in this game
i wish i would have rented it firsti debated between this one and marvel ultimate alliance and i think i made the wrong choicealthough the menu looks a lot like it
i bought this because of the final fantasy iv complete collection which i still havent finished being that the psp isnt very fun to play on in my opinion
the screen is to small and this one cant be outsourced to a tv
some later ones had that ability
i shouldve researched more
i just assumed sony would be smart enough to make that a feature
i wouldve
i now have final fantasy crisis core which is pretty fun but the screen is still too small to see whats going on
castlevania symphony of the night looks and plays good on this system
pretty much the only game that does though you still cant see things like numbers due to the small arse screen
the internet feature on this also sucks being that most sites you go to look funny or the psp doesnt have enough ram to load things saying stuff like not enough memory change your settings
i already did
damn thing
also a monster hunter game was advertised as being really really good
it sucked
i shouldve gotten my money back but all i have is a game ill never play
all in all this thing is pretty much a piece of junk unless you have nothing else to play on
the free games i downloaded on my cheap nokia lumia  are more fun that this piece of crap
that is alli just brought this system about a week ago and its amazingly great but only if you have the right amount of cash as well as computer to go with it i say this for many reasons because when i bought my it needed a larger memory card that will cost you at least  dollars and then if you dont have wireless internet then you cant go on the internet with it and if you really want to put things in it such as musicphotos and video you need a cable that connects the system to your computer and what makes it worst is that your computer may not reconize it and then you can try to fix the problem but it really is hopeless i even contacted the company and they didnt even care and also said it was hopeless and should get a different computer
overall i couldnt take it anymore and return the system for my money back and brought something else  so im trying to warn you do not buy this system unless you have the cash and the right computer or i promise you ll regret it
like i do todayive owned one of these for a brief period but only for a day
we ended up sending this back to the store because we later found out that the game prices for this thing were outragously expensive sorry about my spelling
i probably wont get another one of these until i go to college in two years then maybe these will be cheaper and ill be able to do a better review on these
however this is what i thought was kind of coolgraphics hey you cant go wrong with the graphics on this thing
i watched one of the movies that came with this and the graphics are awesome beyond wordsthat was the only thing that was really neat about it
in the meantime these were the cons about this itemit was very hard for me to take the mini cd out of the compartment that you put the games intoi didnt realize untill the last minute that you couldnt play regular playstation games on hereso really i would have given it more then  stars if it hadnt be for those two cons i put but maybe by the time i go to college ill actually be ready to own one of these im not taking my ps to college with me if thats what youre thinking in that case id almost rather own one of theseit was a frustrating experience trying to get videos to play on the psp
the files have to be named a certain way and created very specifically to the psp
also the mp player interface isnt very good at allin terms of gaming the screen and graphics are quite nice but the games on the nintendo dsds lite are a lot more fun to mein the end i was disspointed in the psp and sold it
i am quite happy with the ds lite it simply does what its supposed to and doesnt worry about trying to do everything
the psp tries to do more but its practically worthless at doing them
the fact that you have to spend additional money to buy a sony memory stick to be able to save games with the psp sucks alsoif you like dying a lot and by a lot i mean a lot without every getting anything done this is the game for you
controls are crap gameplay is crap and you only have  game days to beat the gamethis is a great game make no mistake about it
a gtastyle sandbox game only set in a mall during a zombie outbreak
anyone whos a fan of romeros dawn of the dead owes it to themselves to get this gamethat said there is a serious technical issue with this game on standard definition tvs
the mission text you are given throughout the game is tiny and blurry making it all but unreadable
that means youll go through most of the game with no clear idea of where to go or what to do
this is a real shame because just about everything else in this game is executed flawlessly
buyer bewarethe story line is sloppy
some scene just makes no sense and you dont understand why you doing this or that occasionallythe gameplay is boring and repetitive
yes its quite cool to kill and swim in the zombie sea but after one hour or two you got hell tired of thisas many ppl mentioned the games saving system sucks
if you missed something important you just cant go back
if you happened to save when you low on hp you may waste hours to just get to somewhere that you can heal
in a word the gameplay is just horriblethe graphic is just ok the zombie models are abundant meaning you dont see a lot of them in the same shape lets say games like resident evil  there are only about  kinds of zombies hehe however our lovely photographer just seems abnormal when he runs you can see how weird his motions are
the sounds are poor the voice acting are poorid not recommend this game to othersthis is one of those games that if sober is fun for about an hour if drunk maybe  hours
after that youre done
its just a lot a lot of running back and forth doing stupid little quests and killing hordes of zombiesi bought this game thinking that itd be like a left for dead type of game
its an okay game but the save system is horrible
when you get killed you have to restart the whole game over which can be very frustrating
hopefully when deadrising  comes out theyll fix this problem
the gameplays pretty decent though
if youre thinking of buying this game rent it first otherwise id wait for the sequel to come out to this onehow many times can slashing up zombies be interesting before it gets very very old
that is the question dead rising asks its players as you play as a photojournalist sent to willamette colorado which must not be too far away from raccoon city to investigate a zombie outbreak in the town that has centered around the shopping mallyoure dropped off to the mall via helicopter and have a little over three days to investigate the truth behind the matter
now this game uses a levelup system to increase such abilities as speed and attack power as you kill more zombies find out more scoops rescue survivors and learn more info about the outbreak
you level up via pp points
the good news is you carry over these points for as long as you play the game meaning even if you start all over again or play it again after gettin gto the end youll still keep all of your power
the bad news is the first time you play it youll be so weak and incredibly slow that you wont get to find out the main storyline behind the game
this essentially makes you have to replay the whole thing over again just to be capable of playing the true part of the gameas you spend days in the mall youll be tasked to save survivors and find out more about certain stories scoops that are going on within the mall
all of these are mostly optional but the main storyline of the game is what you want to focus on
all of the scoops either involve saving trapped survivors in certain parts of this huge and very poorlydesigned shopping mall complex or will be a boss fight between large and dangerous psychopaths who have gone crazy in the chaos of the zombie infection
the problem with all of these are the time limits and the time limits are what kill the fun you couldve or mightve had in this game
although im sure some people like the challenge of the time limits the fact of the matter is the simulated time in the game moves much too quickly and the scoops that come by are way too many for you to handle without full lv
 status and even then you wont be able to do too much more
you wont be able to save everyone or do everything in the very short amount of time given especially when you play for the first time and all of your skills are pisspoor
if you cant get to someone in time you will miss out on being able to save them or get a good scoop
and when you first play your poor skills will result in you missing virtually everything
and when that happens all you will have left to do is to cut and slash your way through a neverending horde of zombies until your helicopter arrives to pick you up on friday
i tried to be superman and save everyone
but this only resulted in people getting killed by their own stupidity of not being able to simply follow you or missing out on saving other people or doing optional boss fights against psychopaths
or in the most usual case boththe thing i hate too is that the zombies never stop coming
i mean you can spend an hour clearing out a thousand zombies in one area making it safe for when you have to go rescue someone only to have twice as many zombies respawn in that same area
i mean thats so stupid
it makes most of the killing pointless
i could understand if they came back within a few hours and in the meanwhile the area would be safe for escorting people back to your security room base but nope
its never safe and rarely ever easy
it wouldnt be so bad if the survivors ai wasnt so so bad
all they have to do is follow you and yet the ai cant even do that right either not being able to run around simple objects like a desk or being too stupid to follow youand like i was saying the zombies never end which i guess some players might like
they say the town has  residents in it right
so assuming  of them get infected youre dealing with roughly  zombies in one oddlyconstructed mall right
so youd think if you killed say  of them the game keeps a tally of how many you kill and rewards you a little bit for every  to  killed it would make a difference right
nope
this is what makes the game as tedious repetitive and as boring as the game crackdown
just like in that game no matter how many enemies you kill it never makes any kind of difference
and as the difficulity increases the chances of being able to save people becomes even harder
but this doesnt result in the game being challenging or fun as much as it does in being just plain old annoying and frustratingcould the npcs in this game be any dumber
you tell them six times to follow me
only to have them stand there like idiots until a horde of ten zombies advance of them
then you have to go back and save them while more zombies advance on them while they still stand around like idiots not following you
this game has a lot of problems like this
it can be annoying even with one survivor but when you get to escorting five or six at once it becomes close to impossible to keep all of them alive unless youve got a good stock of queens saved up which kill a large group of zombies all at once
sometimes youll have items that dont work right or ai that is beyond legally retarded
i mean the only npcs that this game actually got right are the zombies
even your main character cant do much as all of his moves are either useless incredibly complicated to pull off correctly or only good for when youre already being attacked
youd be surprised how many combat moves you get for when a zombies already attacking you and how few there are to prevent them from doing that in the first place
other than the knee drop and jump kick all of franks moves are really hard to pull off and you end up almost never using them which is just as well as franks melee strength is beyond weak anyways
i also cant tell whether or not zombies get more aggressive as you level up and get stronger or as time goes on and they presumably start to get more hungry but either way zombies will soon go from being harmless and ignorable to vicious and aggressive in the way they attack you
this seems to be the only ai thing that actually makes sense in the game
they fail with everyone and everything elseweapons in the game are okay but some are mostly useless
you get blunt objects sharp objects like knives and swords firearms and heavylarge objects like benches and trashcans that you cant carry around with you
your objects go into your stock but so do your food and health items
once you use up a weapon which is rather quickly with most of them you automatically are given the next weapon in your stock to use
sadly though both weapons and food are in the same stock
the stock system is poorly designed so i cant even begin to tell you how many times i accidentally used a food item with full health because they switched me over from a weapon that just broke
ill be slashing zombies then switched over to my orange juice and accidentally drink it
this happens so often
plus frank is so slow with actually using the food items
you know how many times ive died during a boss fight because i couldnt use my juice or food in time
you have to sit there and wait for him to drink it all or eat it up before it heals you
this takes like three seconds
and instead of that animation just being skipped when its interrupted by you being hit it just cancels out
so yes you can die quite easily because frank is too slow to drink something up
these are the small problems in the game that quickly add upyou know what else is slow and takes too long
your scoop messages
that otis guy is so annoying
during the heat of a zombie fight you may get a call on a scoop
but when you take that call you have to sit there and wait and wait and wait for the guy to give you the info
again if you skip it it doesnt count and hell call again telling you how its rude to hang up on him
well im sorry if thats so rude that i dont have time to wait for you for a full thirty seconds to get some useless scoop info while fighting off  zombies
you know a text message would be so much simpler and convenient
how could they not see this as annoying
waiting for his slow insane rants about someone needing help for so much time during a few thousand zombies coming at you in the mallthe main storyline once youre actually strong enough to go after it seems to be written as something that sounds greater and more epic than it really is
but once you actually sit back and take it all in you realize that a zombie outbreak connected with the american beef industry actually makes no sense at all
one thing they do get somewhat right is making you feel for the characters given
some people will survive and others will die and when your allies die the nonmall survivors you really feel a little sad for them given how much time youve spent with them
not to give too much away but the true ending is probably less desirable than the bending where you just make it out of the mall after  hours because of what happens to frank during the true ending
and just to bring it up they misspell true a lot in your achivements
at first i was like whats a ture ending
isnt that hilarious
how could they not spell check something like thatextra things in the game include you showing off your photography skills via franks camera
you get points for how good a photo you take that range in the genres of drama horror violence comedy and sex
if you grab the right books in the game mainly the visual cue book the photography can be quite fun
especially when youre trying to snap the elusive perfect photo during a boss fight or survivor conversation
its fun to use the camera but i also havent played any other photography video game since pokemon snapoverall this game is just tedious and often times frustrating with too many game design flaws and poor gaming decisions
like dying for example means actual death
there are no checkpoints or continues or anything and you have to reload from the last time you saved or youll just stay dead
interstingly enough in a game where timing counts for everything youd think thered be a manual load screen in the options or something for when you make a mistake
but there is no load screen
who ever heard of that before
if you mess up you either have to intentionally die or log out in order to restart and youll likely be doing this a lot so not having a load saved game option is pretty bizarrethis game seems to try to be good given the multiple endings the variety of weapons and items the photography minigame and even the different outfits so im not going to say that capcom didnt at least try
they even have some really good songs in here the rare times you get to hear any
however the problem is that they just make too many mistakes and the over game ends up being more annoying and frustrating than fun and survivorhorroresque
the zombies arent as scary as much as they are just a pain in the behind
this game is not in the league of resident evil even and that series while popular isnt even the best zombie video game out there
dead rising is maybe worth renting if youre a zombiehorror game buff
or if you like taking photos and investigating useless scoops and news info
id say the game is worth  stars
while there is some interesting gameplay to be had here like investigating the true story behind the zombie outbreak the time limits npc flaws playing on weak level and simple game design mistakes just suck all the potential fun you couldve had out of this
unless killing endless zombies is enough to thrill you
navigating the mall is also annoying as no kind of real architect couldve possibly designed a mall this inane and oddly constructed
what kind of mall only has one entranceexit anywaythe best thing i can say about dead rising is that the storyline is a bit unique and the characters are somewhat worth caring for
the worst thing i could say about dead rising is that the leasttalented people at capcom had to be the ones who designed and created this game as this is far below capcoms usual quality
if they make a dead rising ii then hopefully the numerous mistakes and bad game designs will be taken care of and the game will end up as the fun horrorgenre title they probably envisioned while originally making thisthe game play is fun
bashing zombies with batspipesplants all well and good
i actually really like the idea of the missions saving people who will all act differently when met with a zombie
the game itself isnt even that difficult
what is beyond frustrating for me and several other reviews that i have read is the saving system
where you can go to save is not displayed on your map and i have spent hours trying to accomplish one mission because the mission itself is difficult and walking to get to the mission can take up to fifteen minutes
because you respawn where you last saved which in this case is the complete opposite end of the mallthe graphics are okay considering when the games was made
difficulty is challenging
aiming is total garbage be it a gun or a cash register throwing thins has never been this difficult and the speed at which you move your gun is lethargic
another thing that bothers me about the game is you can only use a weapon for a certain amount of timehits before it disappears
this is a great idea and adds a good degree of difficulty
however i dont see how swinging a cactus play and a lead pipe could deteriorate at the same speedthe missions are at times ambiguous and must be done a few times before you figure it outinteracting with characters there is no audio just subtitleseven though your character does level up you have no control over your characters evolutionthe more i write this review the more disappointed i am because the game is actually a lot of fun better than any other zombie game i have played but it sucks up too much of my time for not enough progress
you can play for two hours and accomplish nothing because turning the wrong corner can send you back to the beginning
and more time is spent walking from the warehouse to the corridor than actually playing missionsso ultimately you have to buy the guide or keep your computer with you if you ever expect to get through this game
which i am not a fan of because then there is no room for you to be creative at handling tough situations
my advice would be skip this game and go to the sequel
i have heard they fixed a lot of these problemsdead rising finds you in the shoes of a reporter investigating a quarantined town in colorado
you have little say in the opening part of the game your character just kind of hops through cutscenes into the first part
that lost a star immediately i dont care for games that use convenience to move the story rather than player choicethe point of the game at first is to survive a specific amount of time and collect evidence
when you collect sufficient evidence your character will start to put the pieces together and learn what is going on in the town
obviously zombies are involvedthe game takes place in rd person and the controls are easy enough
when youre fighting hordes of zombies it is a buttonmasher style of game
switching weapons and checking your status is easy and straightforward
the game scores points with intuitive controlsthe story and its unfolding drama feel a bit weak and adhoc
it was hard to get involved
i felt led by the nose in this linear drama
the story seemed sterile uninteresting and just plain boring
the characters never impressedthe graphics are greatsometimes too great
the gore is excessive in some plays but i guess its appropriate given that youre mutilating zombies with an array of insane weapons
the sounds are gutwrenching and create a nice horrorfest atmospherethe game is fun to an extent
i was expecting a stronger more involving storyline and was disappointed to find it very linear and uninteresting
story points are revealed but you have no idea what they mean until much lateri hate that concept of showing you something you cant possibly understand until the end
its a game not an indie filmtheres a ridiculous amount of carnage which should appeal to gamers who enjoy visceral action
anything can be used as a weapon plants skateboards chainsaws guns lumber golf clubs etc
the mall that serves as the games setting is alive and full of shops to exploreall in all this game is a decent buy for the price but dont expect too much
its a slugfest that will make you smile but a story that will make you frowni just got a copy of dead rising
now i know how much i dont particularly dig zombie games
this one has a decent premise and it reminds me very much of one of those zombies at the mall movies
the execution is fairly decent for a third person romp  stomp with control that feels roughly like gta
but it just doesnt quite cut it for me
im sending it back
this is the second ever photographerhero game ive ever played
the first one was on nintendo with those pikachu characters remember them
you get points for taking cool pictures of the action in the game
with zombie violence its a bit voyeuristic and considering the clumsiness i felt with these controls i lost interest is trying to score big with it
the hero runs like he has bad knees and the gun has no reticle
its rather cool that you can pickup objects like steel bookshelves and cash registers to beat upside the heads of your pursuers but it gets tired
i got two miserable achievements and its back into the orange envelope
nice try guysive tried really i havei cant seem to get into this game
i have it and plan to finish it it is a zombie game after all but these are so many little things wrong with this
lets start with the basicssaving games what the hell having to find a bathroom
what are we in the s
save places save points save puke
you should always be able to save wherever the hell you want
come on guys this was an easy onethe fighting mechanics they are horrible
most rd person games have horrible fight mechanics
only gears of war has rd person down patthe story not goodcut screens also not goodside games just annoyingmixing to get odd useless weapons so tiring and not funive been waiting a long time for a great zombie game im a horror and zombie fan and i guess ill be waiting longer
this just didnt have anything i was looking for in a zombie game short of the setting and lots and lots of zombies
worth trying out or buying when the price is nice and lowfirst i was expecting like a realistic game and more open world but it is cartoony and its just in a mall not the streets and you only get  hours to finish the objectives  i do not recommend this but  if you like the cartoony style of gaming you might like iti got this game on sale and all i can say is its fun in small chunks to let some frustration outbut it has some bad flawsthe text size is small for those that dont have a hd wide screenthe save system is annoyingyou have to find a break room or go back to the safe spot to saveif you find this game for under  dollars like i did buy itbut be aware of the repetitive zombie kill festi liked the demo enough to buy this game but after a few sessions i got bored
the game is sort of open ended in that you can save people but dont have to
you can also take pictures of carnage to boost your abilitieslame
however you have a fixed time to catch a helicopter out and there are certain missions you must complete or the game ends
the whole storyline just felt slapped together at the last minute
you can search the mall for new weapons and kill them in funny ways
you can even try on different outfitsits fun to kill zombies in childrenswomens clothes for a bit
but eventually i just wanted the zombies to get the hell out of my way and complete the missions
one impressive aspect of the game is that there are literally dozens of zombies moving on screen and i never experienced any framerate lags
however the graphics were only ok and it was annoying to see the same zombie models over and over again there are maybe a dozen or so distint zombie models
try renting first before taking the plungethe text is terrible
i turned the game off after only about an hour of playing it
the idea behind the game is fun and exciting but the way capcom carried it out is pure garbagei wish i had read these reviews before purchasing this game used
even paying  bucks i feel ive been ripped off and will be dumping this pos back on ebaythe graphics are statusquo the text is horrid
i havent even played far enough to really get into the save issues simply because i was disappointed with the lack of freedom involved in this game
it would have been a lot more fun if this were a game like gta where you can pick and choose which missions to complete
an even better spin would be to be bitten and to walk the path of a zombiei must be fair and give this game a  i got to one part where i was able to use a lawn mower to mow down like  zombies
that was funny but the game is still a pile of fat fertilizeronce again a game ive been looking foward to play and once again am left disappointed and ask why
im not going to go in to  a great deal of detail about the whole gamei will say the good parts firstfun killing zombies in different waysvoice acting nicely donegreat graphics and a large area to explorenow the badbuttons are mapped incorrectly making it confusing and cumbersome to userandom people calling you in a middle of a mission or when a bunch of zombies are about to surround you and tear you apartyou run like one mile an hour at all timestime and map not correctly displayednow the ugly and these really cripple the game to the point that youll lose excitement and encouragement very quicklythe first major one is save points or lack there ofyou can only save at the security office and if you die you actually start the game over and although all your stats and abilities are thereall your missions youve completedall the items youve collected are goneand your time that you were on is present when you start over so lets say when you died you had  hours  minutes thats what youll start off with when you begin the game againand thats another thing that mad me madthe time limiti am not a fan of games that puts time limits in games especially ones of this typei feel it artificially adds difficulty and rushes you way too muchyou never get that gtatype feel where you feel free to do just whatever or choose to do a jobdead risings approach is to always have one mission activated with a time limit so you have to drop what you are currently doing and run half way across the mapweapons like guns you get are practicily uselessyou cant auto target which is essential in this game or should have beenyou have to select ithold down r and you stay there like a statue most of the time completely vulnerable and with a little tiny reticle try shoot someone with a high powered machine gun while youre left with a weak pistoland most of the stores are bare of weapons and practical usagesand really everywhere you dont find much weaponsand the weapons themselves disinigrate after  usagewhat can i sayoh i knowrent the game do not buy itif you do buy it the first half hour will be left with boring opening with the arrival of the shopping mall where you escort peoplethen bs aroundsave your game and then try to kill a man who has an pdie and start the game over not knowing that you have to start the game over from the very beginningthats it in a nutshelland if anyone else has the patience to over look these damaging flaws and enjoy this game more than i have then you have the patience of a buddhist monki hope they make a sequal to fix all these flaws and learn from their mistakesbecause this game is certainly what i call a mistake of monumental perportionsthe good puzzle fighter ii turbo is a blastthe bad the other  games are not not many extras  variations of buster bros why even botherhere we have another collection of games that are almost completely worthless
capcom was never well known for puzzle games so why not just stick these in another larger collection
all we get are  lousy puzzle games and one good one
buster bros has three variations
the game sucks as it is why do we need three
the only worthwhile game is super puzzle fighter ii turbo
blockblock is just a breakout ripoff and is less funhonestly even puzzle fighter looks like crap on the psp
these games were poorly ported and with such a small selection who would want to buy this when the back says  games
i played the entire collection in less than  minutes and was done with it
buster bros consists of shooting arrows straight up that are supposed to pop bouncing bubbles
its extremely difficult and no fun at all
puzzle fighter is a gemtetris hybrid that many may be familiar with
chibi street fighter character punch each other when blocks fall
your goal is to chain colors together and drop the breaker block to set the chain off
your blocks you broke then fill your opponents wall
its a lot of fun and this is the only game i could go back to
however there are more fun variations of this game puzzle kombat from mortal kombat deceptionmk for dsthere arent even any great extras like in other capcom collections
the game is just dull and boring and even if you bring a friend along in adhoc youre just going to waste their time as well
if capcom were to have included some newer puzzle games from their catalog or just added these in to other collections it wouldnt be such a big deal
as it stands theres not much to really say about  small games
its not worth the money or your time as even a rental
just stay away from this and enjoy your memories of them insteadive been a silent hill fan from the begining so being the owner of a bright and new shiny psp this purchase seemed like a no brainer after i did a little research on the item
it features the entire comic collection similar to the metal gear solid graphic novel on umd some select songs from the games sound tracks and some behind the scens stuff for the sh movie but in the end it just felt more like a seperate special features disk for the movie rather than a special treatment for the silent hill series
the comics were in my opinion disapointing having thin nearly laughable plots poor characters and very little to do with the silent hill mythos or the games
the behind the scenes features for the movie were interesting at best but felt limited and i wouldnt be surprised to see it all included with the dvd release of the lackluster film any ways
the songs are the only redeeming feature for this title but instead of including the collection of stunning soundtracks in their entirety we are treated to only about four or five songs from each of the game titles
in short this really is just a collection of the worst parts of silent hill in my honest and unflinching opinion
were i a new comer to the series and started with this i would be hard pressed to pick up an actual game
i am praying that the actual portable silent hill experience will be the release of the up coming silent hill origins but as for this title for the hard core completists onlyget this you get the original game but it can only be played by activating it through valves tribute to intrusive software steam
the funny thing is that the original game can be played without having to mess with that garbage if you have the original sin cds i do
so what piracy of sin is steam trying to preventsteam is simply spyware i disable it as soon as i get emergence launchedthe emergence game cd will not install properly if you have older versions of steam installed in a custom location on your computer
reinstall this spyware before installing sin if you really want to play this gameemergence will crash the first couple of times you try to run it and will continue if your video card drivers have not been updated recentlypersonally i am sick and tired of having to check in with valve every time i want to play one of their games
these crazy control freaks at valve are ruining the computer gaming industrythis isnt really a review but a warning to parents
do not let your child download the tweak that allows you to see the female characters in the game nude
there are no sex scenes in the game like gta but beware
otherwise this is a good gamethis game made me realize how stale the fps genre is
asides from a few gems there just isnt much new here and this game is a perfect examplethe levels are uninspired and boring
we have seem almost all of it before
there are a few cool details such as the jetpack enemies that are flung around by the physics engine when you shoot them
towards the end of the game it also gets a little better in the level where you work your way up a highrise building
this level is ok and would do nicely but it can not elevate the game to greatnessoverall i was rather bored by this game
not that there is anything really wrong with it but it simply made me feel like i would not miss a thing if i never played another fps again
also like most sourcepowered games this game makes me nauseous
i guess the problem is more with me than the game so i wont deduct any stars but stilloh and in case you want to play this game because a game magazine wrote this puts the hooters back in shooters if you are over the age of  there isnt much in this game youd find titillatingthis is also another steamgame which means that you have to install steam and be online to play the game even though there is no online component to the game
due to steam it takes forever to install the game this is supposed to be an episodic game  a concept inspired by tv shows  but it takes twice as long to install this as it would take to watch an episode of a tv show odd
also steam will now sit on your machine and deliver advertisement to you and generally keep an eye on the things you do
valve has now fixed steam to a point where at least it wont take you days to unlock the game but i still do not care for it
i have also bought half life   episode  together with this game but unless it blows me away completely i will probably not buy another steamgame in the near future i might have actually rated this game a  overall it if wasnt for steamnot since final fantasy i have i been so frustrated with a game in the series
earning money to buy things is incredibly difficult
unlike previous games in the series enemies do not drop gil
instead they will sometimes drop loot which you can then sell
heres the caviat enemies dont always drop loot
stealing anyone
i find more time stealing items than i think is necessary for the gameplay
also there is the fact that you have to buy literally everything in the game
weapons armor and accessories i think are reasonable to purchase
but you also have to buy your spells and abilities
this makes stealing and looting essential
you can also poach enemies for additional loot this however will prevent your characters from earning the experience and license points you could obtain by defeating the enemyi also have gripes about the ability system
every ability requires spending license points which you obtain by defeating enemies
however in order to equip better armor weapons etc
you have purchase the necessary license
this becomes incredibly frustrating since you need to purchase equipment licenses and then need to purchase spell and stat licenses as well
this game has forced me to grind so much that its ridiculous
im at about  hours of gameplay and from what ive seen im a little over halfway through the game
this is insane
i prefer my rpgs to be able to play through in about  hours total i like to get back to my normal life at sometime
occasionally i will come across a lengthy rpg i can digest for long periods of time or repeated plays a la mass effectas far as the story goes its ok a lot of the story elements in this game remind me very much of ff vi
there is not a lot of new ground here but im usually ok with that if there is a good flow to the game
since i have to grind so much when i do play the story elements ive forgotten things that have happened up this point
also the characters are not very detailed or developed very well
the main character vaan seems to be lost in the mix of the main plotline and is actually one of the weaker characters of the game although most of the characters are fairly weakly developed baltheir is the only worth a damnsidequests are almost a must
these occur in the form of hunts which will grant experience and loot
in most rpgs im not a sidequest player
i usually stick to the main story elements but sometimes when there is a world i find to be incredibly fun or gorgeous i will so sidequests i will also do them if ive already played through the game once without them to vary the playing experience
this game almost makes sidequests a must which just about makes the story drag and pause for unacceptable amounts of timethis is a game that i think looked good and had great sound a good concept but very poor execution
some of the game mechanics are annoying and irritating
i wouldnt buy this game unless you can get it for less than  and have the patience to play a ridiculous amount of hours
ive never given up on an ff game before but this is the first
ive completely lost interest at this point and am hoping that ff will be redeemingthis isnt your average final fantasy game
completely different there is no random battles you really dont need to use magic at all other then to heal and with its own class system where anyone can be and do anything meaning nobody has there own strengths
this game has had some very mixed reviews some think its actually pretty good while others think its utterly horridwell im leaning more towards the horrid
i absolutely hate games with out defined characters job systems just are a bad idea
magic is pretty useless other then for healing
and to make money you have to sell junk you attain from battles like stones and pelts
the battle system isnt that great either to start a battle you need to get close to the enemy
battles are very sparse so it takes forever to level but if your just running somewhere there are enough monsters to annoy you
while the graphics are absolutely beautiful graphics just dont make a good game
i stopped playing it after level when i first read the description i had though that this game would be the dynasty warriors version of final fantasy but it isnt even close
do not buy this expecting a lot of button mashing action
buy it if you enjoy good graphics with bad british actors and if you never liked casting spells during your final fantasy adventuresi picked this game up for  and i plan to get my money back from it
i did not like this game at all
the opening cinematic was truly amazing though and the soundtrack doesnt disappointwant really made me hate it was the real time battle system
i am a pretty true final fantasy fan but i also love action rpgs
with the real time stuff it felt like i should have been mashing the attack button to attack action rpg style
but no
i just stand there waiting to attack while the enemy attacks me until my action meter is full and then i attack with one hit then wait again
it is very tedious slowed me down and boringanother thing what happened to the character design
the characters in here look so terribly ugly it was pathetic
they are just not pretty to look at
the graphics overall do look nice on the other hand
it is what you would expect in a newage final fantasy game but not the character designi did like how it was set in a middle ages type setting with advanced technology but still talk old english
that was nicei only played for  minutes but i just could not play it any longerits been a while since i played this game but i thought i should give it a review
lets start with the good i am a huge fan of what they did with the battles
a lot of people arent
i appreciate that they tried to go in a completely different direction from the previous ffs
setting up what you want your characters to do during battles was kind of fun and did take some thought
the hunts were fun but could get rather annoying and most of the time werent worth the rewardgraphics were great
slightly improved over ffx my favorite ff and video game btw
some of the cities and areas are some of the best looking places and interesting places in all of video gaming imodonethe badhere we go oh my god this has to be the worst cast of characters ever to be created in any rpg
i kept hoping the main character would just die
he is the worst main character out of every final fantasy
he is completely and totally pointless
the rest of the characters were really bad but i kept hoping that one of them would kill him and take over as the main character
any game that i have to play some prepubescent kid that just tags along with more important characters is not a good game
he was so bad i used the same three people through the last half of the game and he wasnt one of them
the only character more useless than van was his little friend penelo
the rest of the characters to me the only one that was worth a crap was balthier
he was witty and had some backstory to him
his playboy bunny fran was the equivalent of ffxs kimahri but less interesting
ashe was an attempt to copy yuna but instead of a good backstory and personality just remove both and make her completely uninteresting
basche was decent as the strong guy of the party but still not that great
the enemy
basically a human seymour guado with less style and once again less interesting the story
where was it
basically a hodge podge of people trying to overthrow the emporer who has invaded their country
thats it
no real plot twists no real oh man i didnt see that coming
now i have to finish the game to see what happens
i kept waitingand waiting for a good plot twist
but noonce againdisappointment
want me to sum up the story for you
country b invades country a country bs emporer is killed by his son
group of uninteresting people from country a unite to try and overthrow the new emporer
the party finds out about these rocks that augment your power and magic ability
the new emporer is using them and he goes kind of mad
party is able to overthrow the emporeryep thats about it
ohand there are some box shaped god like creatures in here too that play a small role
anyways i found it to be similar to ff which i consider the worst ff of all gameplay
a license board
really
talk about your carbon copy of ffx but removing everything good about it and replacing it with bad stuff
talk about destroying the classic jobs that ff does so great
once you get to a certain levelhalf way through the game every character is basically identical
need a mage
put on a robe and give himher a staff
change your mind and want a warrior
well give himher some chain mail and a sword
this might sound cool but really its not
take ashe the princess
you might think hey she would be a natural white mage and you would give her a rod and a robe
but give her a sword and some armor and she is just as good as basche the knight as a warrior
give me a break
its not realistic
no high and mighty princess is going to be able to cut someone up just as good as a knight
dont get me wrong
i know this is a game
but i do like a little realism in my games
the sidequestsall pointless and annoying except for the hunts
the hunts were cool but most of the time even those were not worth the effort
i cant even remember any of the sidequests and that should be evidence how bad and pointless they all were
i can still remember some of the awesome sidequests from ffx and ix and i played those before ffxii
the ultimate weapon was a spearwhat the hell
the ultimate weapons are a huge factor for me and this one was a stupid spear
bahh
gilgamesh
hes in this one i know hes been in others too
im a big gilgy fan
i liked that they returned to the comical gilgamesh unlike the uber serious summon from ffx
but what was the point of fighting him
he was a hunt and i was so looking forward to fighting him the last timebut i didnt get anything for it
the strongest sword was a sunflower
there were so many cool things they could have done with this game but they all just seemed like they were going somewhere then just stopped
the item creation thing had some potential but a lot of the items were just ridiculously hard to makeoverall i almost suggest just not playing this game
thats hard for me to do since it is a ff and its one of the numbered ffs and not just a spinoff
however i think you should play it just to maybe get an idea of what they were trying to do
also it makes you appreciate the other ffs more
this game is basically for the person that wants something pretty to look at and be fooled into a game that has a story
its basically ffs version of an fps
no story
no character development
pretty visuals
i cant say enough how much i hated this game
im really hoping  is a great gameor at least decent
squeenix has a lot to salvage especially since ffx was a homerun and this waswellsomeone that shouldnt have even left their house and went to the ballparkwhere do i even begin for this one
final fantasy xii is the only final fantasy i havent finished
i managed to get in about  hours of gameplay and even with that investment i think im still only halfway through the storywhich reminds me where is the story in this game
this is the first time i played a ff game where i honestly cant even remember what its about
i tried picking up where i left of some time ago only to give up in frustration again
the characters are about as boring as they come
vaan the protagonist is a whiny teenage boy what a surprise who is rebelling about something and he wants to be a pirate and hes pissed about some stuff and the other people in the party are angry about something too though you wouldnt really know it since they appear to have no emotions whatsoever
the dialogue which is hidden somewhere between the endless monster grinding and sidequesting is about as bland as natural flavored oatmeal
there are no witty oneliners there are no heated debates they just tend to walk along stating facts making dreary comments about the sociopolitical problems of their world
if i wanted that i would watch cspan not play a video gamewhat this game really lacks and desperately needed was a bad guy
oh theres some prince or whatever whos manipulative and sneaky but its so dull
bad guys need to be bad they need to have an evil laugh you need to see them torch a village to the ground so you can hate them and want them to die
ffxii has villains but theyre not interesting theres no drama theres no excitement or anythingthe gameplay is really contradictory the battle system has you auto attacking for basically  of all battles
then theres about  different macros or gambits that you can make to help make the game even more dull
but wait its not gonna be that simple you have to find all of the gambit parts first oh and if you want to cast spells you have to first buy the spell and then learn the talent for it
that wouldnt be so bad if the spell buying system wasnt so completely frustrating
oh you want this spell
sorry this store doesnt carry it but you could go past a dozen loading screens and check the other store which probably doesnt have it either
which brings me to another point loading screens
my god this game is absolutely plagued by them
the maps for all the towns and places are divided into dozens of subsections
getting to the sewers in the main city will probably mean you need to get through  or  loading screens
and i hope to god you have all the maps memorized you dont want to have to look them up since getting to the map where youre at will require you to load about  screens because when you bring up the map you start completely zoomed out instead of zoomed inthis game just goes out of its way to frustrate people
and no matter how hard i tried i couldnt get past how badly it was made
the soundtrack is so dull its lacks any sort of emotion or creativity
i usually buy soundtracks ahead of time because ff music is always worth it
well it wasnt for this one it sounded like a regurgitation of the ffta soundtrackall in all theres about a hundred rpgs id recommend for play before this one
if you missed this title and are afraid youre missing out on something then dont worry this game is something you can miss without regretyeah the xbox  gets warm but this doesnt do anything
its like the nightly news they use fear to sell product
you are supposed to think something is wrong and that your xbox is going to blow up if you dont have the cooler
the xbox gets hot but this is ridiculous
save your money for a game or some fast food lunches
this is pointless
im reviewing my friends because i wouldnt be fearful enough to buy thismine hasnt melted the  yet as with other folks but it did develop a horrible noise problem
the  is already noisier than it should be
the intercooler adds even more noise although more like a normal wisper fan would  still its noticeable
and now only a couple of months later it makes a horribly loud sound
cant see how anyone could use the hddvd addon with as noisy as the  and intercooler are even when they do work properlyother than that does it work
i guess
it blows out hot air
does it create more hot air since it powers from the  to blow out as others have suggested
who knowsi used to be a big proponent of the intercooler
after three straight hours of gow my  would be hot enough to fry an egg on it
at least the intercooler kept it at a low sizzle
but lately its been causing my  to act like its possessed
they tray sometimes wouldnt close when the system was off occasionally the fan would even stay on
the last straw was when i got the three rings of death
at first i nervously laughed it off and restarted the system
things were fine till it happened again and then again
i went through the standard troubleshooting checklist ie
unplugging the power cord removing the hard drive shaking the system up and down etc
i finally removed the intercooler and my  has been running fine ever sinceforgive the short review but the subject pretty much sums it up mine actually helped in terms of cooling and made a noticeable difference but it is so ridiculously loud brandnew out of the box you will be debating if you even care to use it
then after a few months when the bearings in the fans get dusty or whatever it gets really loud after it runs for a while it quiets back down but still inexcusable in an era of bearingless fansnot recommendedwhile the  can run hot if not properly ventalated this plug in fan doesnt stop the  issues out there
you  and power supply needs to be in a position where air can flow thru easily
try and avoid having your  and power supply on the carpet or areas where there is little airflow
that being said i do believe this cooler helps to cool the  slightly
the intercooler has  fans running and it plugs into the back of the   then you plug the cord into it
i have a problem with the fact the intercooler uses the voltage from the  instead of its own powersource
the fact its taking amps away from the board is theorectically not a good thing
you dont need a cooler unless you cant put your  in an open area
if you have to get one of these may i suggest the  stand instead
some of them have batteries or they plug into the wall
that way no power is lost from the   these things dont extend the life of your  and they will not stop the  crashes that have plagued the system since birth
ive have talked with techs at two major repair centers and they all say this will not solve the  crash issues
if you have to have one then get the stand that uses its own powersource
you have been warnedthe nyko intercooler is a bad design as so many other people have stated
the one problem in particular i was having is that it liked to become loose for seemingly no reason and the  wouldnt turn on because the intercooler and  share the same power source
seriously it would get loose just by loading and unloading games
mine never had a chance to melt because i got rid of it after it came loose a couple times
the unit did work when it stayed plugged in technically so it gets a big star rating from me
a star rating would be justified though
i mean it didnt even help to hold the  up vertical it didnt make the base any wider than it is stock wo the intercooleron the bright side i found the gameshark intercooler as a replacement
it works great
it has its own power cord so no more problems there
the gameshark version is also a battery charger comes with mad catz rechargeable batteries and a white  controller pack vertical base and it has a slot to hold the  media remote
the  cooling fans also have an onoff switch so it doesnt run nonstop
the base of this one is about  inches wider than the  base so it actually does make a good base for a vertical xbox
unfortunately amazon doesnt sell this version of intercooler so you will have to check out your local game store or other online seller
the gameshark intercooler would get a  star rating because it works as advertisedexclusively on the sega genesis tmnt  hyperstone heist was the scapegoat to the successfully popular tmnt iv  turtles in time for the snes
while turtles in time got rave reviews konami decided instead of porting the game over they would just storm up a new installment for the series for the sega genesisunfortunately this title lacks much when compared to its previous kin
the fighting is shoddy unfair at times and the traps lasers and daggers that shoot out of seemingly nowhere make it almost impossible to beat without getting frustrated
and to boot the game is only five levels long
i dont know any game that could be considered decent that only had five levels of gameplaythis game was rushed feels horrible to play is uninteresting and instead of creating  or  good levels at medium strength they pack an unfair amount of difficulty into five short levels level four which is arguably the hardest and most boring consists of two go screens with optional foes and four bosses
when you continue a character you must start over from the beginning of the level
talk about frustrating especially if you are on the last bossthere is no good scenery save for the ship level and the production of the game seems sterile and uninterestingthis one gets two stars from me even if i did wear it out as a kid
playing it recently i realize why the game sunk to the back of my collection as a kid
it was too hard and not even fun to playif youre looking for a good vintage turtles game check out turtles in time
way smoother more fun to play mapped out great and better scenery overalli adore rpgs but i absolutely hate this one
the battle system has you waiting sec or more for the moon to make a full rotation before you attack
once you destroy and enemy on the map it comes right back so you must clear out of the area
while you are accessing your menu you can be attacked
your weapons break after a couple of battles so you have to constantly by more materials to make them
you need materials to make everything or you buy them at super high prices from the store
so if the enemy isnt dropping enough items then you cant make weaponspotions you need bc you wont have all the components
while crafting the character can fail then you lose materials
worst of all you spend most of the time running back and forth to the same places
from sepnia forest back to jade city thats like  min running on the map to get back and waiting for screens to load
the maps are terrible
while the map is popped up it covers most of your screen and you cant see where youre goingbut wait the most awful thing about this game is lack of save points
there are hardly any so if you are in a dungeon in this game places like the lunar tower youd have to go back quite a few screens to get to a save point then battle your way back to where you were b if you get tired of playing or want to save before  boss fightfinally to nitpick the japanese language part of the game the main characters name is shane but the english text is calling him lancethe lack of save points the shoddy and extremely slow battle system constantly breaking weaponsthis game pisses me off on so many levelsi really wish i never bought this game
unless you are extremely bored with a whole lot of time on your hands and you dont mind running back and forth to the same towns over and over and over dont waste you timemoney of this load of crap gameif you are unable to rent this game before you buy it i suggest you skip itoh youll be taken in at first by the pretty graphics and immersive environments and you will want to like it
you may notice some idiosyncrasies here and there a save system that relies on save points that are few and far between an almost entirely linear path from the starting point of the game to the end ie
there is literally one path from the first town to the third town and travel between the two is time consuming and tedious an inability to truly pause the game between enemy encountersif youre like me though youll over look all of that  at least until you get to an unexpected boss battle and youre caught unprepared because all of the enemies in the area were incredibly easy to slaughter and you didnt save at the last save point because of that fact and the boss picks you off without difficulty and you have lost an hour or more of tedious repetitive workand those themes start to shine early on tedious and repetitive
in combat in story in quests
i still dont like disliking this game
it is some sweet eye candy but i cant get over how shallow the game is in the other more fundamental aspectsyes once upon a time when the rpg offering on the psp was much more limited than it is today this game was something of a beacon of hope
today though youre better off spending your money on something likecrisis core final fantasy viiortales of the world radiant mythologythis is a middling roleplaying game
the plot was ok and it was holding my interest
the game ran too slow on my year old xp machine
it ran ok on my new vista machine but got buggier as i got further into the game
i finally had to give up because the final quest crashed both computers
there are better games out therei have always liked madden games but i found this one to be hard to control the players
and it lacked in graphicsive always tried to get into football gamesmy friends really digg them and we usually have similar game tastesi dont watch football and ive never really entirely understood it i of course get the basics thankyouverymuchthis game has one of the worst learning curves ive ever experiencedi love when i can pick up a game and have a general understanding on how to playthis is not one of those gamesmy son played the pc demos of this game with no problem so i purchased this game new and gave it to him for his birthday
he was excited but that turned to disappointment when the game didnt install because of a corrupt data file
it saidlegos star wars ii errorerror a  a file that is required cannot be installed because the cabinet file e defaultcab has an invalid digital signature
this may indicate that the cabinet file is corrupt
error  was returned by winverifytrustso the cd is corrupt from the factory
somehow i found the troubshooting file on the cd
it said to go to their support web site
to get support you will need to send them a dxdiag file from your computer download and install flash player download and install mozilla firefox
now open your new web brouser and type in their support website to get help
it tells you to insert the cd and open their patch
lo and behold the first thing the patch does it to repair the corrupt cabinet file
so why does a big company release a cd that never should have left quality control
i emailed them and am still waiting for an answer
so unless you are prepared to do some major troubleshooting buy your child something else
all three sw games that i tried had a host of bugs and needed patchesbuyer beware
i wont be buying the first legos edition since i hear it has even more bugsjust like its predecessor lego star wars  the original trilogy is a strangely fun and addictive take on george lucas classic fantasy universe using lego blocks for just about everything in the game
this makes the game series not only family friendly but a blast to play regardless of your age
now the series makes its debut on the ds and while it still provides some of the fun found on the home console versions something has noticibly been lost in translation
taking advantage of the ds d graphics capabilities lego star wars  still has most of the same charming look that youve seen on the consoles and the levels and areas are nicely designed as well for the most part
however as you further play through the game the more and more apparent the bugs and glitches become
from a schizoid camera to graphical glitches to some mind boggling ai issues the game is packed with bugs that nearly ruin the game
however i said nearly and thanks to the games lack of difficulty and use of infinite lives its not impossible to get through the game
then again it wont take you long to get through the game either
now just about everyone whos played the console versions knows how short the game is
now imagine that shortness decreased even more to fit onto a ds card
this is a big disappointment but unlike the games many glitches and bugs this was to be expected
there are some multiplayer features here as well which are a blast to play through and are worth checking the game out for alone
that being said unlike the home console versions and even the psp and gba versions lego star wars  the original trilogy for the ds is worth a look but is better left on the shelflego star wars is perhaps one of the best games to be released this year
its absolutely fantastic in its execution
as usual though the handheld versions get the short end of the stick
the psp version of lego star wars is just about the same as the console version
i was expecting the ds version to be identical but on a less graphical scale
i was wrong
theres more changed in this than ever and to be honest it just isnt all that its cracked up to be on the nintendo dsyou begin in the mos eisley cantina
this is the hub and where youll be able to select an episode you wish to play
at first youll only be able to choose episode iv but after you complete the first chapter youll be able to dwell into episode v the empire strikes back and episode vi return of the jediplaying through these levels isnt nearly as exciting as it is on the console counterparts
the game is fully rendered in d and youll have all sorts of characters at your command
youll blaster toting characters jedi ewoks chewie and plenty more
characters also have their own unique moves
leia has her slap chewbacca can run up to a stormtrooper and rip his arms from his sockets
jedi can use the force
jawas and ewoks can do down shutes and reach places characters cant
characters who wield a blastertech can use a grappling hook to reach other areas while droids may have to open up doors
theres a lot of variety
youll be in a party the whole time and youll often have to switch to other characters
for example han solo cant open doors and so youll have to let cpo do it
there are doors that rd can open but cpo cant
so you cant just barge through a level as just one characterplaying through most of these levels though is a hassle
the camera is often unfriendly
there are moments when the camera swings around and suddenly you cant see yourself because you happen to be behind obstacles
you might often die just because you cant see yourself or in some instances the person your shooting
the good news is that in lego star wars there is no such thing as a game over
the only penalty you receive is losing studs
still you might suffer some deaths that couldve easily been avoided had the camera let you see yourself
you dont get much control over the camera either
you can use the touch screen to control the camera but youll often have to take a break from combat just to use your stylus to control the camera
and its not a lot of fun since itll often get stuck on other objects
having the camera be controlled through the touch screen wasnt such a good idea either
it probably wouldve been easier had it been set to l and r since those buttons arent really used for anything
the touch screen is also used for a few other things
switching between your characters customizing them or navigating the menu for instnace
the touch screen isnt an integral part of the gameplay though and youll never find a moment when youll actually have to use it
its just there to make things a little easier
such as only having to double tap a character icon to swith as opposed to going up to them and pushing x  other than that youll never find a moment when you absolutely must use the touch screenthere are a ton of extras to be found in lego star wars
as you go through levels youll collect lego studs that serve as currency in the cantina
you can buy cheats unlock characters this way and plenty of other little things such as playing the game in medieval mode or something like thatthe heart of the extras comes from unlocking the characters and going back into levels with them
when you unlock a character theyll be walking around the cantina
you can switch to them and then enter any level youve already completed once
this is freeplay mode and in order to find everything and do everything in lego star wars youll have to do this
unfortunately some levels are of poor structure and just arent as fun to play through a second time
especially the levels with awkward camera angles
all youll be doing in some cases is punishing yourself to fight with the camera again
none of these levels are very long either and some of them just arent all out exciting
theyre not heavily populated with enemies and most of the time youll be running down empty corridors
even worse theres a little glitch in some levels where if you run around as a droid your enemies wont shoot at you at all
it makes what couldve otherwise been an exciting game rather blandthe controls are also either unresponsive or too loose
in some levels where you pilot vehicles such as the hoth battle youll find that control these vehicles is a pain
you cant turn properly and i often found myself caught up on some of the environments and couldnt get off because i had to fight with the camera just to find myself first
in these levels the controls are rather loose
in other levels such as when you run around blasting people the controls sometimes dont respond until youve pressed the button two or three times
the good news is this doesnt happen too often
the bad news is when it happens in a fire fight or when youre supposed to jump over a pitgraphcially the game doesnt look bad on the ds but there are some flaws and bugs in the graphics
pieces of the environment getting cut off or your character standing in mid air when he should be falling into a pit
usually just small little things
there are also moments of slowdown
the game certainly doesnt look bad but these small little glitches and bugs can be tiresome to look at
it feels like a game that was rushed out into developmenti wish i could tell you the music score sounds absolutely fantastic
it will certainly remind you of the movies but it sounds nowhere near as good as it couldve have
many tunes actually sound like they belong on your super nintendo
the super star wars games certainly sound more true to the movies than this one does
a lot of the music is tinny and hardly sounds like the movie
this is strange considering on the gba apprentice of the force sounds very similar to the movies
here it just couldve sounded better
it strange that they couldnt get the actual soundtrack to come through the speakers when the ds is fully capable of such
it should sound just as good as the console versions but it doesnt
the tinny music sometimes makes me want to turn the volume downlego star wars on the ds isnt bad it just feels unfinished
as usual the handheld version gets the short end of the stick with the exception of the psp version of the game
the nintendo ds version is no where near as good as it couldve been
youre probably better off sticking to the console versions for this onethe goodit doesnt look badthe gameplay isnt bad eitherthe badthe sound is butcheredlot of graphical glitchesframerate issuessometimes unresponsive controlsa lot of camera issuesonce again another madden has been created

wow
so players in real football go through other players torsos
they skate and glide around the field at mph without moving their legs
wrs change direction on one foot pivot glide and elude tackles
uh okanyone who plays this game on the allmadden level will notice right away that this is the furthest thing from a realistic football gamewhat are the nerds at ea thinking
do they enjoy making a game whos ai constantly cheats
i love how they tout games that give the user more control when the user has very little control over anything that goes on in the game
i dont control if i catch it or drop it or intercept it or if my line blocks of if my dbs cover their assignmentnone of it
the computer makes my line miss blocks or not block at alldrop easy picksdrop easy catches etc
and why oh why are dts and lbs faster than my fastest wr
is that realistic
the ai is terrible
it blatantly and unrealistically cheatsterrible game
just stop making these games if this is your final productthis game is a huge disappointment and for  that is just not acceptable
game is too fast and the buttons are not laid out well at all
sure you can change them around but why not fix them right in the first place
graphics are good but not great by any means
save your moneyi bought an xbox just for this game and i must say i am disappointednothing really that much more exciting than ncaa  for xboxsure the graphics are nice but the dynasty mode is lackingthe create a player mode is lackingand everytime i have gone to play it the game freezesnone of my other games freezeim not really understanding but i am frustratedi think i am going to take the game back tomorrowi realize that with only a little more than a month before the  version comes out this review is coming a little late but i just had to throw in my two cents which is what this game should have costwhen this game came out last july i was so excited to get it that i went to target at  in the morning the day it came outsomething ive never done for any game
disappointing is a major understatement for this game
yes the graphics are great but it takes more than great graphics to make a great game
realism is something that was completely ignored in this game
the designers clearly showed that they had either forgotten how football was played or had never even seen a gamehere is a list of some of the aspects of gameplay or lack thereof the thing that annoyed and angered me most about the play of this game is the artificial intelligence if it can be called intelligent
the players in the game make ridiculously impossible plays on a regular basis
i cant even count how many times i have seen a cornerback cover  yards in three steps from a dead stop to either knock a ball away or intercept it
or seeing a defensive lineman jump four feet in the air to knock a ball down
or seeing a running back get hit by four people simultaneously and somehow stay on his feet and run for a touchdown
or numerous other oversights i wont mention
penalties
anyone who has ever seen a football game knows that it is nearly impossible to get through a game without at least three or four penalties more often than not penalties can get into double digits
in this game i have gone entire seasons without double digit penalties
and the penalties that are called are completely stupid
pass interference is the penalty that i have the biggest problem with
pass interference is called so inconsistently its laughable
i have been called for pass interference for knocking a ball out of a players hands after he caught it but not had it called when i have been surrounded all sides and had everything done to me short of being knocked down as the ball goes by
it eventually got so bad that i just turned pass interference off
but numerous other penalties are never even called
i have played  seasons in the game and never once was there a facemask penalty illegal formation illegal substitution and i can count on one hand the number of times a holding penalty has been called
weather is something that is another problem specifically wind
wind has no effect whatsoever on the ball
on kickoffs the ball goes just as far when it is kicked against or with a  mph wind as it does in calm conditions
though compared to reasons    this is really only a slight annoyance
one thing that i do like about the game is that it is finally possible to block kicks and punts as well as return kickoffs and punts for touchdowns
anyone who played previous games knows that it was nearly impossible to do any of theseto sum up this is an unbelievably weak game
ive learned a lesson about buying games right as they come out before knowing how good or bad it is
hopefully the designers of the newest version have read the reviews about this game and made up for their mistakes or maybe theyve been fired and replaced by people who actually know football
all we can do is wait and see and praythis game is bad
and this is exactly what madden will be like with different rosters
first of all ea puts out the same game every year and adds new rosters
is that worth 
no
i have played this game and let me tell you why it is bad
this franchise has been here forever and still ea cannot make the ai any good
it shows that ea does not take time in their games and uses a big franchise name to their advantage
passing is so incridibly easy i found myself throwing hail marys every play and catching them  of the time
i had times where my man with the ball gliched into my own player and ran into nothing for a period of  seconds
also i had a time where my line man being chased by the other team runs into the ref in the middle of the field and i slow down becuase he decided it was better to sit their in the middle of the field rather then move so i got tackled
the players run so unrealistically that they look like gorillas and guess what they all run exactly the same
in addition to that this game looks exactly the same as madden  for xbox  it does not look good at all
its the xbox version in hd
there are  charactor models in the crowd and all of the coaches and players in the side lines move exactly the same
i guess in real football there are only  characters in the stadium and everyone in the sideline managers to move the exact same
thats a ea cheaply created game there
the game is so cheaply made
actually sorry this is the  version of the game and has been for the past  years
they just added new rosters
espn by k blew ea out of the water with their actual good football game and they bought the football license out becuase they were scared shless
ea seriously if you have the football license all to ur own why do u realease the same game at  years ago
why dont u actually make it betteri got this on the basis of it being a final fantasy game
i was disappointed to find out it was a fps and not a rpg
i guess fps games are ok im just not big on them
that having been said the graphics are good as well as the story
the sound is good as well
i had to give it two stars only because it was a fps
if you are a fan of fps type games then you will enjoy this one
as for me it will be going to the used game store as i wont be playing it
charlie sill cut to the chase on this one
if you are a fan of final fantasy vii you will look over the shortcomings of this game and find some enjoyment out of it
it has a good story and characters
its fun to see some of your favorite characters from vii return
but if your not a ff fan then you wont have much motivation to play this game and im not sure why you would like it
its very average to mediocre as a action game
its not horrible by any means but its just not very good eitherhonestly this game could have just been so much better in just about every aspect
gameplay wise there is nothing unique or interesting about it and i was just trying to blow through it too get to the next story part
its also pretty easy and not very challenging
i cant really complain about the environments your fighting through tho they are well done and some are very well done in my bookwhile the story is easily the strongest part of the game its not without faults either
its pacing isnt very good and some of it doesnt make a whole lot of sense either
but its kept alive by a strong cast of characters and some amazing fmvs in typical square fashion
but the story could of been much better as well
im not complaining because it is good and gives you a good backstory of vincent but it could of been better if it had been longer
it just feels rushed and suffers because of that
i finished the game at about  hours
if it had been longer and closer to  hours they really could of done some special things with the story and developed the villians morebottom line if your a ff fan youll probably enjoy itfinal fantasy vii for the ps was and still is considered one of the best rpgs ever created
the same cannot be said for the spin off of a side quest character that tries too hard to be hard core and ends up being mistaken for a devil may cry clonethe good newsyou can customize your weapons to cause maximum damageits kind of neat to see final fantasy vii characters in d with voicesthe bad newsthis game is horribly paced
you cant get into the game play because theres a cut scene every two minutes or so
most of them have nothing to do with where you are fighting so they seem terribly misplaced and you just dont really care enough about the characters to want to watch them
this game is way too concerned about being an animated movie rather than an actual gamethe aiming system is shot and you cannot lock onto enemies the way you should be able to
if this had been fixed this could have at least been an average gamethe same goes for the camera you never face the direction you want to face and that immediately gives this game the score that ive chosen for iti love final fantasy vii for the ps
i even liked advent children a little bit
but this is criminal for anyone who likes the franchisewasnt what i was expecting
i was expecting the typical final fantasy epic storyline chocobos and parties
but you play one character vincent its storyline is okay so far i think its more full of drama than it needs to be and comes on early in the game not later on when the plot thickens and vincents personality is rather strange i want to say stereotypical
worst of all its a shooter
they annoy me
it helps having an autolockontarget feature at the beginning of the game you can later switch it out if you want to
and if you die you have to do the whole level all over again i think that is the biggest disappointment and frustrating aspect of the game especially since i sometimes forget to watch my health because im so absorbed into trying to figure out where my targets are
there are no chocobos cactuars or moogles so far in the game
there are still other creatures but i love the old ones
the environment is all modernfuturistic cityscape i have yet to see nature
the game is too annoying for me to continue it
i guess i should look up the game before i purchase it in the futureafter espn k sports sold out to madden a couple years ago i was forced to play madden even though ive hated it for years
madden  wasnt too bad and with buying an xbox  i decided to pick up madden  first off the graphics are good the game interface is terrible and often at times very frustrating
no team create player creation lacks fun
and trying to increase players skills is hard and a bad way of improving your player
if you play with you team past  to  etc
the rookies will start being numbered  or single digit numbers for any type of position an exmaple being linbacker number 
this game is all what its hyped up to bein november  i ended my review of madden nfl  for the xbox  by saying hopefully next season ea sports can throw in some of the gameplay modes that made madden so different while improving on a few of the annoyances
now nine months later im sitting in my gamer chair rocking back and forth with those new gameplay modes i wanted but all of the same annoyances and a few more that ultimately make the sophomore nextgen madden experience a very sour one indeedmadden nfl  for the xbox  returns with beautiful graphics and attention to detail that made last years game look and sound nice
the graphics have even been improved the menus look sharper there are flashy introductions to each game and the animations look better than ever
there are some truly brutal tackles in this game
the field deformation looks fantastic and shows the realistic wear and tear on grass fields
the radio announcer is back again this year as well as the increased amount of onfield chatter and far more realistic reactions from the crowd and stadium announcer
and once again john madden got a sock in his mouth as a guy who simply cant stand hearing meaningless obvious banter im very happy to not hear this mans chatter for another season
the soundtrack is pretty alright with some of my personal favorite bands afi audioslave rise against being on the lineup
all of these things are the best things about madden nfl  which is why i wanted to get them out of the way
now let me proceed to tell you why you shouldnt be buying this game on the xbox last year currentgen madden players were treated to a new mode called superstar mode
superstar mode was very similar to ncaa football s race for the heisman modeplayers would create a character and take him all the way through an nfl career in hopes of making him a superstar and a future hall of famer
this mode was great in madden nfl  because you had all the same control over your team albeit with an obligation to get the ball to your player or on defense sack the crap out of opposing quarterbacks
this year superstar mode has shown its face on the xbox and im not pleased
im not please at all
in fact im disgusted
superstar mode in my opinion is the worst thing ever to happen to maddenor perhaps its the execution
in this new mode gamers are stripped of most control over the game
youre thrown right into the shoes of your own created player seeing the field from only his perspective and doing only what hes supposed to
if your character is a qb and you dont like the playcall too bad make the best pass you can and good luck getting into the hall of fame with all of those sacks and interceptions the new camera angles make it almost impossible to see so much of what is going on onfield
its really sad because superstar mode if executed more like ncaa football s race for the heisman could have been the best thing to happen to maddennot the worstfranchise mode last year was pretty bare and its sadly just as bare this year
i recently found a lot of enjoyment in creating a multiplayer fantasy franchise with a few friends in currentgen madden nfl  and i was very sad to see that once again this option isnt available in the xbox  version
franchise is simply put a string of seasons with basic administrative options and the super bowl and pro bowl waiting at the end of each season
the only perk this year is the ability to go into training sessions with three of your players throughout each week of the season
doing this will let you play some of the skillbased minigames as well as raise the statistics of your players if you succeed in meeting the scores in each of the minigamesas a bonus for when and i said when not if you get bored with madden nfl  ea sports included some highlight reels of dozens of nfl hall of famers
its nice to see old players being awesome and id really like to see more highlights like this in future iterations of the game
sure these guys are hall of famers but id really like to see highlights of current players as well
for instance seeing clips of cover boy shaun alexanders  firsthalf touchdowns a few years ago that would have been really cool
it would be interesting to see in future games of madden if highlights like this could be added into the actual game alongside commentary to show off the history and background of star players
they do this in real life and if its in the game its in the game rightafter playing currentgen madden nfl  its really hard to enjoy the nextgen version
i start noticing things that are so obviously necessary to the game
for example there is no playmaker control in nextgen madden nfl  there arent as many hot route options
the playcalling menu something i didnt mind last year is abysmal for multiplayer games
even the new and highlytouted run to daylight blocking feature was stripped down for the xbox  version of the game
most importantly of all though madden nfl  on xbox  just doesnt feel like madden
its as stiff as a yearold kicker
its as chuggy as peyton mannings scramble
it doesnt feel quick smooth or fluid like madden is supposed to feel
if madden is supposed to feel this broken they should put limpin leftwich on the cover hobbling to the sidelinesanother thing if ai
in football games doesnt improve i give up
unless youre constantly playing allpro or allmadden difficulties youll encounter some absolutely ridiculous ai
maybe its just my bad luck but the favor always went to the opposing team
for example my defensive backs absolutely never knew where the ball was
more than  of my swatted passes were done manually
interceptions are never caught but batted away
blocks are oftentimes completely missed by guards and fullbacks
players get stuck together running routes
theyll run their routes as the football is thrown just over their heads without ever trying to reach up and grab the ball
some of the animations for play action passes and bootlegs are so lengthy that a blitz will cut straight through the line and result in an easy sack for the defense
tackles in nextgen madden nfl  are so frequently shed that its almost useless to do anything but abuse the hit stick
alternatively tackles are too easily shed with the highlight sticka welcome addition to the game but something thats so easy to use its hard not to feel guilty abusing itthe problems dont end there
i encountered so many unexplainable flaws in this game that its hard for me to believe it was finished completely
is it a bug or just a new rule that i havent heard about for the game to automatically cut off your control when youre winning in the end of the fourth quarter
sure its unsportsmanlike to run up the score but ill be damned if ill sit and watch the play clock tick down all  seconds to be a good sport in a video game
i think its just a bug because it happened pretty randomly in my play time
the graphics and frame rate stutter very often causing frequent but short pauses that break up the fluidity of the game
and the bug to stomp out all bugsthe frequent crashes from madden nfl return in  my game crashed five times before i ever actually finished an entire game in franchise mode
its hard to enjoy a game when it crashes that often
something really needs to be done herei love madden
i look forward to its release every single year
i had never been so excited to play a madden game before and madden nfl  for the xbox  turned out to be the biggest pigskin disappointment ive ever endured
what could have been the first true fullyfeatured football classic on the xbox  ends up being nothing more than a game that should get passed up by gamers for its currentgen superiors
the sad thing is i dont know where ea tiburon can go with this game
they started from scratch with madden nfl  on xbox  so my only suggestion now is to do what k sports did with their nba and nhl franchises use the same engine as the currentgen games and simply beef up the visuals and presentation
id rather have a prettier version of currentgen madden nfl  than what came out this year for xbox  madden nfl  looks and sounds wonderful but if you actually want a fun football experience look no further than the game of the same name on playstation  or xbox
youll have a much better time for  cheaperyes the graphics are pretty  except for player faces  but this game doesnt even match the gameplay of playstation  maddens of a few years agoea pulled the sheets over my head  dont let them do it to you tooevery year madden dissapoints and we are led back to the slaughter this year
but ea sports topped themselves this year
because as an xbox  user we get an extra treat
we pay  more and get less features
missing is the fantasy draft
you can not draft your own team
on top of that there is a fatigue glitch which means no one gets tired
the manual has been reduced to four pages i can only guess next year it will be two and there are at least  new rating categories per player yet no explanation as to what they do
this is the last year i buy madden
i ask myself every year why do i do it
it is quite sad that ea sports gets exclusive rights and then produces such a lackluster game
very sad indeedthe graphics are amazing
yes that i will give the lastest version of madden
but where the graphics win the game play suffers
i personally think eas lock on football is going to turn a lot of people off the game
i just think ea if you have a lock you should do better and not offer up something like  give us proof you wanna make quality and not a fast buck
keep trying because this one isnt cutting itwhat a piece of garbage
i bought the collectors edition and took it back after a week
i lost  bucks but didnt care
madden  will be as bad as well because they are still using the same graphics engine that they have since the xbox days
terrible seriesyou probably read many of the other reviews
i have to side with the negative reviews on this one
yet another   game that is not up to par
if you have never played football on a console before you might like this
i stopped buying ea games last year and will continue to not buy them
renting them is the best that ea deserves at this pointokay this game sucks
no way around it i dont care what any of you fan boys out there are saying i thankfully rented this game first so at least i didnt drop  bucks on this pile
ill start with the two good things about this title well sort of
you see even what this game does good it at the same time sucks atsuperstar mode is a nice idea but is not executed very well
i started off as a halfback which i thought was going to be a blast
unfortunity i was wrong
the shotty camera makes it almost impossible to see anyone coming at you
you basically are just running in the direction of the play and hoping to gain some yards
after one game of that i started over as a quarterback
playing as a quarterback is much much better than halfback
you actually feel like you have some control over the game calling audibles and moving players around feels great
but you never have control over which plays are picked which wouldnt be a huge problem but it seems like the computer is picking plays at random from a list of five or six plays
i found myself changing the play with audibles a lot
also if you put the computer in charge of the rest of the team defense side of the ball your going to loss some games
one game i scored  points and lost to the chargers   ladainian tomlinson had  rushing yards and four touchdowns
my defense couldnt stop him
philip rivers threw three touchdowns on top of that
in other words the computer ai stinksokay now for the graphics
during gameplay they are great but after a play has ended the camera switches to closeups of a group of players seems to be only a couple of shots
when it does this you notice the game chugging real hard
its horrible slow down that is unforgivable
this slow down is even more apparent in superstar mode
before each possession you are given a chance to pick your role for that drive
this enables you to boost stats for your players or lower the opposing team stats
this screen pops up as your coming to the line for the first play
however due to the slowdown many times i was able to start the play before it came up
when it eventually caught back up it paused the game mid play
that is laughablethe annoucer in the game does a good job giving the play by play but sounds like he is broadcasting from a tin can
other than that the sound is fineso as you can tell i hate this game dont buy it dont rent it
as for me i guess i will have to play espn football  for the rest of my life because ea doesnt know how to make a decent football game anymore or anyother sports game for that matter
ea should have got mlb rights and visual concepts and sega should have gotten rights to the nfl only in a perfect world i guess
trust me if you are disappointed with the new madden go find a copy of espn football  it is still the best football game to date
madden is dead to meit pains me to write this review since i have been playing madden since the days of bit consoles and the series humble beginnings
madden could always be counted on for  thing innovation without sacrificing the great core gameplay
thats why gimmicky buttons and animations and minigames never really detracted too much from the overall madden experience the core game was solid and reliably fun and addictive
no longer
this iteration of madden is the weakest yet and truth be told it is a disgrace to the xbox s capabilities and the madden name
try as i might this game has so many flaws and holes that i just cant recommend it to anybody
the bad has finally come to outweigh the goodthe good graphics
they are really phenomenal and the new animations are more fluid and realistic than ever
the player models are well done and on a hd television this game is truly the closest weve come to photorealism
the new ability to control other players on offense such as a lineman or a blocking fullback is one of the few cool innovations
i love being able to lead block for my hb go tiki barber
 and it adds some depth to the gameplay
the superstar mode also has something fun about it in an rpg kind of way but it does wear thin pretty quickly
the new playbook organization is a great help allowing you to choose a play based on play type key player formationthe bad oh boy where do i start
in no particular order there is only  camera angle
thats it
the new minigames stink up the joint and make the createaplayer feature all but useless
since your ratings are derived from your performance in  silly and difficult minigames it is nigh impossible to create a playable character
you also cant edit the existing rosters
this means that this game has zero replay value since you cant manually update the rosters to reflect player improvements etc
you cant save a game in progress so be prepared to play through or lose all of your data
the franchise mode is pathetically weak compared to previous years and you cant adjust anything once the franchise has been started its set in stone
the player ai seems to have regressed especially when you are trying out the new and fun lead blocker feature
running backs will often cut back upfield into a tackle even though you have a perfect block on somebody
receivers similarly get tangled all the time and playing defense is a losing proposition
defensive line players sometimes dont respond right at the snap and trying to guard somebody manually just has never been feasible
also there is no madden in this game just some really irritating guy trying to sound like jim rome
the game tends to have graphical hiccups during transition scenes and it takes forever for keypresses to register during menusthe ugly the menus and menu interface
just an unintuitive piece of junk reflecting a recent trend in bad interface design from eathe worst part
because of the ea sports monopoly on nfl licensed football games we are stuck without a competitor to challenge madden and really make it work for our money
shame on you eaokay so i liked madden  then i got this game
i now have   and  btw
this game is horrible
the players dont look even slightly realistic and the superstar mode is full of bugs
cpu controlled offense is awful
the quarterback consistently takes the snap and immediately throws the ball in a random direction despite the coverage
ive seen good qbs like peyton manning throw  interceptions in a game because of this
it makes pass rushing superstars like des useless as well
also the running system is very flawed
on toss runs the defense is often able to get to the running back right as he gets the ball resulting in up to  yard losses and frequent fumbles
they also make offensive linemen even good ones have severe trouble blocking linebackers
one of the blown blocks looks like the oline just lowers his head and the defensive player goes right under him
nobody would ever block like that
the hitsticks look ridiculous
on one of them your player just lifts the other player size irrelevant and slams him into the ground
running backs get way too many   runs as defense just lose touch with the field and the punt return system is flawed as well
cpu players run right at defenders and often get stopped near the  yard line
it is also impossible to block punts though field goals can be blocked very infrequently
player intelligence is absent in this game
its kind of fun to play cb and safety because the qb often throws the ball right to you but its not realistic at all
i wont even comment on franchise mode
this game does not have a coop
two people on the same system cant play on the same team on this game
really
crappy madden worst one they ever made if youre asking mehey ea thanks for buying the license and not allowing k to give us actual good football games
this game sucks
nfl k was better then this
k is better then ea becuase k tries
ea puts the same game out with new rosters
i garuntee put out k with the different rosters
noone will know the differenceyep  i said it
everyone seems to have the same ideas and views that ive been saying for years now
i think one of the other reviewers put it best buying madden every year is like getting a new calendar  yeah technically its different but in the end well you get the point
this review is a little long but since i dont think ill be doing another one for any ea title anymore  as i wont be buying them  i wanted to cover everything that i could think of in case anyone is like me a longtime player and customerea has effectively eliminated all competition by purchasing the nfl license  no need to push the envelope by putting out innovative and fun quality products now
hell theyre bold enough now to even take madden out of the madden so why are some surprised that other features are gone
rip k series  you were the best but whos really to blame  the companies who obviously are in this to make  and doing a good job or the fools out there in line at midnight saw it on the news  how retarded is that
throwing all that  away every summer
me  i hate everybody in this equation equallyi really wanted to like this game
i really did  in the end i think i received it in the best possible fashion  got it as a gift
just cant see paying  for roster updates  thats essentially what this amounts to
yeah its supposedly better than last years version which i hadnt played on the  but its now just as good as maybe  on the regular xbox
why are we settling for moving backwards  especially when were talking about the 
why are we so excited over possibly getting to a point that we were at  years ago
use the gasprice analogy if it helps you understand why so many people are pissed  you get excited now when you see gas prices at  even though you were using the same or better quality gas for  or less a few years ago
same general principle here  because people bh and moan but ea can count on them to be in line at gamestop or walmart on release day with hardearned money in hand hoping they wont be disappointed this year
praying that this is indeed the year
no
ea knows this
yeah i can talk  i stopped purchasing madden in  when i realized that they were more interested in that little  selling football franchise tag in the corner of the game box than in keeping their customers satisfied
overall the graphics are nice  decent is maybe more accurate
i play this on my  hdtv the perfect setup for those sports nights  this game just seems to fall a little short to me
even my wife said this doesnt look like its by the same people that did the boxing game
fight night round  which we love  the only thing keeping ea afloat as far as im concerned dont get me wrong  its not the worse game by any means
i disagree with the review that said it was like gameday   thats a little extreme
i dont need the jerseys to get dirty or care if i can actually see the field get torn up as i play  it would be nice definitely
dont know why we cant have that but anyway  there was some detail put into the movement of the faces and all  i can see the effort there
whoever said that these were spoton accurate representations of the real nfl players must have been smoking something highly illegal
these are detailed faces indeed but of very ugly people
cracks me up actually  and why is everybody ridiculously cut on this game
my punter is the same size as my lb
is balco in on this game too
im willing to deal with mutant players and the lack of certain other details
i dont think we should have to settle for average overall games though especially with a title as established as madden
definitely expecting more from a system thats supposedly more powerful than any home computer you can getgameplay is familiar same running patterns with a few new animations  still choppy and unrealistic even on the mighty   who do i have to talk to about getting some gang tackling on here
jesus  its   this shouldve been a part of madden by now
but i digress
button configurations are overlycomplicated  the menu interface is probably more confusing than it needs to be but you kinda get used to it
much like a rash  camera views particularly in the superstar mode are absolutely horrific
as a qb you cant see a damn thing on either of the sidelines
i guess its still a decent idea but i much rather play the superstar mode from last year on the xbox  who really thought that giving players the ability to play as an ol was the one element that was missing from the series seriously
the idea of only controlling your superstar annoys me  i guess it is realistic in the sense that you only control you in real life but in a video game
nah  id still at least like the option to control the entire team on offense and defense
glitches
the fatigue button is a joke and doesnt work realistically
i mean seriously doesnt work  to the point where theres a patch in the works to fix this
why is such a hyped product still having major glitches before release and still being rushed into stores
another thing  i unlock a mr barry sanders not bad
but why does he automatically end up on another team in this case the panthers throughout the course of my franchise
you have absolutely no say in what happens
i dont like that
again this isht should be ironed out before the final product is released
im not a fan of patches and quickfixes  you get enough of that dealing with a computergameplay interface still allows for ridiculous ease beat the cpu  on allmadden my bears  points
against indy with  min quarters
of course an  point deficit in the th quarter didnt deter the colts from onside kicking after their sad field goal  why does this still happen on every madden game
first time playing  nothing new there
all of the little gimicks and everything wear out their welcome by game number  because at that point youve seen every and i mean every item and animation this game has to offer
remember k and k when you still found new stuff or heard new commentarysaw new animations like  months later
yeah me too  sniff another gripe of mine maybe small to some is the music and commentary
i know no one even diehard maddenites could say with a straight face that maddens painfully obvious playbyplay could be mentioned in the same breath as the k series but i actually miss mr madden in this installment
the radio announcer thing no
doesnt work
music
well i know everyone has their different tastes but im not feeling this
considering this is the  why dont we have more control over what music is played and whenwhere
true you can have your saved music playing but guess what
it just plays continuously throughout everything
compare this to the original xbox  on nfl k you could not only choose the individual songs you have playing but assign different points in the game  after touchdowns long drives turnovers etc
 that the particular song would be cued
you could even pinpoint a particular moment in the song and have it start from there
for my money nothing was more fun than listening to lil jon scream whaaaat
after a big sack or truckstick hit
you can say im nitpicking but is it really on a  system
why do we have to wait until sony comes out with the competition or arguably superior product  ps before microsoft actually cares enough to put out what we  as consumers  deserve for our money
if ea and microsoft for that matter would like to get back some fans and loyal supporters yes ea your nba live series sucks too what the hell happened to you
those previews look promising but so did maddenncaa 
 they should offer  instead of ridiculous prices for garbage  maybe roster updatenew feature patches for the   if you subscribe to xbox live gold which isnt free you should get this for no fee
if you dont have the live connection you should be able to download it on a computer and put it on a disc or something  charge about  for this
i think that would be fairif you have to buy the new version every year then youll go and get this or already have
if you love madden for whatever unrealistic reason youll find a reason to love this game if only to defend your choice to purchase it
having played madden since sega genesis im expecting more
for you maddenheads out there whose hearts hurt when you read a negative comment about madden stop being so damn sensitive
do you need a hug or something
did your sister or son make the game
no
then dont take it personal
these are my opinions of a game that i own
stop reviewing the other reviews and put your honest comments about the actual product
if you like it then put why
other than the fact that you may secretly be mr maddens lovechildhows this  maddens gonna be the best football game for  guuaranteed
see
feel bettermadden  will be the one though right
lol yeah rightoverall  and  stars okay   looks pretty
the rest is kinda forgettable
not the worst game ever but nowhere near where it should be  charging  for this is insultingmy son loves this game
i bought it for his birthday
up until then he was borrowing his best friends copy of the game
it has brought him hours of endless joyfinally
i got my dream game on the go
first off college football is my favorite sports title of all time
the rivalries the trophies  etc
all i wanted when i bought my psp was college football
and finally that day has come
i have been playing it non stop since yesterday at  am and thankfully i am in love with my psp again
of course there is gta burnout and fight night which are all excellent games i own
anyways  lets go thru some issues hereyou can only fit so much data on a little umd and i know they had to cut some corners which is fine
gameplay is awesome fun and a lot like ncaa  that i still play on my ps which has my boy joey on the cover go ducks
the rendering of our stadium autzen here in eugene is way way way off
like i said they can only fit so much on this little disk so im sure there are only a few stadiums in here that are the real deal but thats fine
i named all my duck players which took a while and then had the cpu auto name all the other players so they had names and not just numbers
this is a pet peeve of mine so i had too have all the correct names for my oregon ducks so if felt more fun and authenticthe controls took about an hour to get used to but i feel like a pro already
the jump the snap thing is cool and comes in handy if you time it right
and the graphics and replays are all excellent for the psp
no complaints here
its ps quality and thats what i look for with psp games
so far this game is everything i wanted in a college football game on the go for the psp
 the rushing glitch everybody is talking about the glitch when you rush
so far my copy does not have that problem
i played a whole game just rushing and i watched really close to the yards and it was accurate everytime
i hope i bought a good copy
talk about luck i guess
i will keep an eye on it though because there are just way to many complaints about this problem and i would think every copy would have it
i will revise this review if it comes up
i pray ea fixes this problem because this is a really excellent gamepros college football on the go
ps qualitycons the rushing glitch 
autzen stadium isnt really in the game
our new oregon uniforms for this season the all black all white and all yellow isnt in the game
after killing arizona    at the end of the game it showed arizona celebrating like they won
the juke function isnt all its cracked up to beeas new slogan if its in the game if we can or we dont get to lazyand rush the title out without testing it for bugs then it might be in the gamej villa said inability to kickpunt the ball because the snap button wont function during the kicking gamethats because you use the analog stick to kick
 revised  the rushing glitch is alive and well in my game
the computer was at rd and  they rushed for about  yards dangit and now its th and  for the cpu
ea better have this fixed asap
is it just me or has ea become a worthless tired company
they have so much money that they can buy the nfl franchise rights but they cant pay a computervideo game nerd to sit in the basement and test these games
this game is really really good but this glitch is huge
i mean  if the ducks uniforms were pink and purple thats a cosmetic glitch but when it involves the gameplay and pretty much the whole thing the game of football is built on the running game then thats way way unacceptable
ea is on my you know what list now
anybody else with me on this
update sent my copy back to ea and within  days i had my new copy back
its awesome
the rushing glitch is fixed and i also noticed another glitch is fixed
on my old copy when you win a game at the end you see the losing team celebrating like they won
that is now fixed also
the losing team actually looks like the oklahoma sooners pouting and shaking there heads at the end of the game because they lost
good job ea and thanks for the  coupon towards another ea title thats awesomecoming from years of playing games like counterstrike day of defeat tfc the dark forces series etc i was compelled to give this game a try because of the vehicles and squad tactics aspects of the gamethe game is hard to classify as a game because it seems about  or better of your time is spent running or driving only to be killed by an unseen artillery or air attack
some of the problems with this game are part mechanics part gameplay and part are the behavior of most people who play it
some problems areit takes forever to id someone as friendly or an enemy
ive had times where ive trained my cursor on someone for  seconds without getting a red or blue indicator of sideonly to be shot from behind while im impatiently figuring out if i can shoot without getting a teamkillthe game is often dominated by those who get to the planes and helicopters first
the rest of the players are all just target practice on the ground making it a run die respawn cycle for everyone else
and there are people who will hop in a tank jeep chopper etc
and take off with no one on board leaving everyone else to either go on foot or wait for the vehicles that left to get destroyed and respawngame is somewhat choppy expecially compared to similar hires fast action games
i have a fairly new  beefy alienware computer that eats up doom  and source games like nobodys businesscamping or baseraping
the enemy sits on your spawn point and continually bombards or shoots you the split second you spawn
ive seen this in other games of course but here it seems to be much much more common
the ability to wipe out entires waves of spawners with airstrikes or artillery makes it more seductive for people i supposethe only fun map i played was gulf of oman which not coincidentally is the map you play when you download the bf demo
if i could have contented myself with that i would have saved myself some moneythe sniper is weak
its good that they nerfed it to avoid the oneshot cheapness of other games like the awp in counterstrike for instance but it is so weak it takes more shots to kill someone with a  than it does with a sidearmincredibly slow loading times between gamesnitpicky point here but you cant use mousewheel to scroll through serversas far as the special forces addin which makes this the deluxe addition you get hooks and jetskis
whoopeeso i payed  for  days worth of pointless gameplay
doesnt look like i can get much for it on ebay so this baby is headed straight for the garbage chute
my advice download the demo and play it for free because in that case the price is righti was extremely happy about getting this game but it just isnt that fun the story is good the action is good for a while but it lacks the simple but important act of being fun from second to second the guns are very uninteresting when u do get a new one its fun for a battle or two then youre bored
you do get a great one three quarters into it but theres never enough ammo for it so its back to that same gun all the aliens have the simple truth is it isnt fun which is a huge disappointment
i really wanted to like this game i loved quake  and others like it but this isnt one of themdespite all the advances in computer technology this game runs very very slow an even the latest g macs loaded with memory and a super fast video card
dont be sucked in by the false promises of superior graphics performance is way to poor to run the game on the higher graphics settings
at the usable graphic settings the game looks about as good as the d civilization iii
all of the d graphics are really just a big wastebased on the poor performance i cannot recommend this game
there are plenty of other games that are just as fun but run well and give a total sense of satisfaction
this game might be a nice bargain in the clearance bin after you buy a next generation computer sometime next yeari was very excited to have my original baldurs gate i   when the packege arrived i was very disapointedthe discs are labeled black and white and very poorly printed no manuals and the  discs on a box for  discthis pack sucks i should have chosen the original i and ii instead of this bad packi dont recomend the buyte game in the other hand is great excelent story and characters an epic quest from begining to endbought this game because it got such stellar comments
i got to the first town and cant bring myself to put it in again
sure if youre old enough to remember how games used to be and you enjoyed those days well buy this im sure its great
but if you are accustomed to any graphics easy of interface or speed in a game you probably wont like this
theres just too many other games id rather kill time on than this one
i bought it because i really enjoyed pools of radiance but that game is miles ahead of this onewhen the original game is a groundbreaking masterpiece its sequel rarely lives up to the unavoidable hype
there are notable exceptions of course baldurs gate ii and max payne ii spring to mind
however never had i been so disappointed with a sequel more than dungeon siege iifollowing the innovative and brilliant original ds the anticipation was so great that minor flaws would be forgiven
with ds though it was one big blunder after anothercontrary to the original ds for which one had to physically tear himself from the computer screen this one is a boring chore
running back and forth to the base camp to barter equipement is a tedious procedure with all the fun sucked out of it
moreover no matter how much you improve your character either leveling up or equipmentwise your enemies simply match your abilities or resort to crowding resulting in no change in the gameplay
i am not talking new enemies but arent higher leveled characters supposed to easily wipe out enemies encountered many hours before
this way the whole game is nothing but a evenleveled blandnesson a similar note why was it necessary for minor enemies to have so much life
i was bored out of my skin hacking and slashing forever
increase the damage they can cause and keep it interesting  do not give them a longer life only to artificially increase the games durationoh and the enchanting system was a joke  since the items found were much better than anything one could pay to have forgedgraphically ds is not even one step higher than the original ds
shadows and particles may have increased but characters and equipment have not
as a result the heat of the battle even on highend systems will find you in the midst of a disorientingblurthis is theunavoidable expansion
it does not offer much more than a short campaign and some new trinkets
importing your character from ds is a much better idea than choosing one of the badlybalanced precreated ones  onlya persisting bug will not allow itthis was the chronicle of a botched job foretold
with the exception of oblivion which was an excellent game one can count on k games toruin any game franchise and kill its successful progress once and for all
gaming history is littered with the relics of their failures stronghold ii civilization  not until its expansion did this one became a playable game sid meiers railroads  the list is endlessthey should probably stick to consolesmy advice avoid this stinker and instead try the original dungeon siege and its expansion
it is a much better gamewell its a great game after the patch is installed except for one crucial areacombatput it to you like this
sometimes your troops will not engage the enemy
period
they will stand close by and die by the dozen while one or two fight valiantly
then try to control them and you never know what your going to geti had full legions at times that wouldnt even leave the fort
its a known bug but are they going to fix it since it basically ruins gameplay
do not pay full price for this its not a completed game yetthe game had major potential in the fun department until i ran into this issue
the economics of it are intriguing and very well donethis is a good attempt at a game that sadly misses due to obviously being rushed to market
there are several game breaking bugs for example the cursor ingame is skewed and doesnt match its location on the map
meaning it is difficult to target
the graphics arent very good yet the performance is pretty poor on fairly powerful machinesfurthermore this game has a very poor interface with big console like buttons and a clumsey build interface
the economic system in the game is completely lacking with little indepth data on the inner workings of your citymedieval lords a low budget title from monte cristo is a far far better city building game than this
ultimately this is a dissappointing game that could have been much better if a bit more care was taken during developmenthey have you ever played caesar ii from the s
yeah well this game is basically a knockoff of that game with better graphics
and quite frankly caesar ii was more fun
i dont see how civcity has any point
you build your city and nothing interesting ever happens
there is no progression to the game that keeps it freshthe makers intergrated technologies and wonders from the successful civilization game series but they are inconsequential in this game
these people should stick to what they are good at the civilization series and leave city games to people who know how to do itive heard that a new installment of the caesar series is out now caesar iv and i havent tried it but it has to be better than civcity rome
this game is boring dont pay any money for itthe civ name has been tarnished
analogously one thing i have been learning is that just because sid meiers name is on a product it doesnt mean the product is goodin the case of civcity rome unfortunately it doesnt just come in at modestly good  it comes in at dismally poor
ive tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about civilization in general but after civ came out i am starting to believe that firaxis games and sid meier are on their way out
and now thisi regret to inform that the great civ titles were made a long time ago
the offerings of today have a simple pattern the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should obviously have been included in the original release  they take advantage of our love for the franchisethis pattern is so evident that the whole sid meier and civ franchise is degenerating
it almost seems especially with the release of civcity rome that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old
but the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great gamesstay away from civcity rome
besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good the narration and sound effects better or the interface to work properly
the game is a dismal failure and i am sorry to report that
it seems like firefly studios had an idea and got the license from firaxis but they just cheesed itwatching what maxis the sims and simcity franchises and firaxis civilization franchise are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunkk games got me
when i saw civcity and the k games logo i figured that its from the makers of civilization  and it will be great
wow was i wrong
although the graphics looked good in the previews as well as the upcoming gameplay it was a disapointment
the gameplay is very buggy and the tasks dont keep you active
you can build and build then wait and wait
when you are playing the game the graphics are slightly choppy
caesar  has better graphics and gameplay if you look at the side by side
so if you are looking for the latest in historical city building i would pass this one and get caesar outdated the day i got it  did help for a few of the current games i had on the shelf
worked as advertisedwas a bit difficult to figure out at first once you get going on the game it is hard to put down
this is different in the way you move from cell to cell doesnt allow you to make notations different backgrounds are nice but once i found one that makes it a bit easier to move i wont switch it nowthey should be ashamed
they could have did waaay better with this game
i bought this game and returned it the same day
i had high hoped for tekken  but it dashed my high hopesultimately tekken  is just another tekken gamethat might seem like a good thing given the overall quality of most of the past tekken games but really its just a way of saying if you already have the other ones dont worry about this onethe same crop of characters with the same crop of moves in the same style of gameplay returns for the same old tekken
with a few additions
really really crappy additionsif youre already familiar with tekken you know the drill
you choose your character and you wallop people in a twitchstyle one on one fighting game
you can step into the foreground or the background charge or step back counter etcthe gameplay is typically deep for a tekken game
there are a large number of ways in which the characters moves interact and a large number of characters and styles to choose from however this game is probably not for the buttonmashers
like other tekken games mastering the game requires an indepth knowledge of every character so you can not only make the best use of your characters moves but also anticipate and counter your opponentsbut whats in this game isnt nearly as important as whats not
what are not there are significantly improved graphics gameplay or stories
overall tekken  does a poor job of building on the mythos gameplay or technology of previous tekkensworse yet the game has some serious drawbacks and wastes of space
the rightly reviled scenario campaign mode is an abomination that requires you to play through a final fight style beatemup by repeatedly switching between the left analog stick to move and the directional pad to fight
enemy difficulty in this mode is all over the place with bosses that have two fullscreenlength health bars mini bosses that require dozens of strikes and common enemies that with devil jin at least  use him as your free unlock at the start of the game can easily be wiped out en masse with a single kick
forget the fun mini games of the past tekken games tekken  only offers a digital sadist for people who really enjoy hurting themselvesthe last boss azazel is also a ridiculous oversight
some characters particularly those that cant effectively juggle opponents will struggle with continue after continue trying to down him between his unblockable and cheesy attacks while others such as law can practically stick a broom handle up his rear end and wipe the floor with himthe online mode isnt much better
its laggy and slow which can be very frustrating when trying to play a ranked matchthe worst part however is the insane number of load screens and their lengths
unless you actually sit and watch the story videos in campaign mode which you probably wont because the translations are awful and most of the dialog is complete nonsense the whole thing is virtually nothing but one long string of load screens between a few short stages
character select lags while the game loads selection animations it loads before a fight it loads after a fight its just one giant load screen sometimesoverall tekken is a typical tekken game if you ignore the abominable campaign mode load times and the poorperforming online mode but thats why its such a lousy tekken entry
its still fun to sit down and play against other people but if you already have other tekken games to play theres no reason to really buy this one
pick it up if you see it on clearance for a few bucks but otherwise just pass this one upboring and predictablelike others said the load times are pretty crummy for a nextgen fighting game on the ps
the campaign mode has a ton of cutscenes if you like that sort of stuff but the game mechanics for that portion of the game is just a grinder it does nothing specialthe offline fighting campaign mode gets tough as nails towards the end to the point of frustrationthe online fighting suffers from lagging and mismatched fights where a beginner will be paired with someone with a bunch of fights under their belt alreadymaybe this game would be slightly better when using a fightstick but not by muchsometimes tekken is a balancing act
it starts strong solid fighting with everybody having advantages that make the others advantage not overwhelming
thats good
but then theres some big guy who some people say is too powerful and others call cheap after some swearing
not all of them have this
i remember  just had good ol heihachi at the end
awesome
s final opponent has everything you hate about ogre and jinpachi plus his own dirty tricks that bring a pretty good arcade mode to a frustrating annoying conclusion
if the game is a balancing act this guy spins the player around and then cuts the tightrope
why is that worth mentioning
because its really really annoying and because really the arcade mode is just tekken  but pretty and with a couple new characters
so azazel is about the only thing that stands out
how bad is he
i mention him more throughout this review and if i see a nonhuman character as the end boss of the next tekken game im not buying it until its  or less if at allthe biggest problem is the new scenario mode because its not only not very good its long
its tekken force that you have to play to unlock story mode
one character at a time
what is the point in that
why would they make story mode part of another section of the game
unless its so we dont have to fight azazel for each character it makes no sense
if it is that though im not sure if thats a mercy or a bad judgement
but since it would be weird for the makers of the game to recognize fighting their last boss is a pain in the ass but not correct it im guessing thats not the reason
so poor planning it isanother thing that irks me is the character customization
its not bad its just expensive
it costs  monies to wear no shoes
reread that sentence until it either confuses you or you cant see the problem in it and if that happens you are a masochist
to put that price in perspective ive played through four levels of scenario mode and about fifteen playthroughs of arcade havent spent anything and i have less than  monies
if i double that and then get half that again i will have earned the right to wear no shoes and then be completely bankrupt
yeefrigginhaw
its a small part of the game but if you were looking forward to using it clear your calendar
or better still forget itfor all my misgivings about this game most of it is fairly solid
its not a bad game by any stretch
its nothing really special but it functions and is fun until the final round
i really dont mean to keep mentioning that but you have to understand he is so ing cheap
he blocks without trying
he teleports
you can even blast him with devil jins beam watch it hit him and see it do nothing
on
easy
should you buy it
hard to say
i could almost say no just for azazel
i hate that guy
plus the scenario mode is not particularly fun
but if you can stick to twoplayer it should be okay
honestly though i think you can get  for cheap now so i would just do that
the box has two seals of best of e from gamespot and gamepro
i want to play what they were playing because unless e was slow last year it wasnt thisthis is one of the most disappointing fighting games ive played this decade
i cant believe im having to say this about one of my most beloved franchises of all time
something else thats even harder for me to believe is that i used up the last two remaining vacation days i had for work to stay home and play this complete piece of failing garbage
theyve failed in no less than three major areas of the game and here they arefirst and foremost the graphics
wow people werent kidding on the forums when they said this game looks dated does it ever
everything from the fighters and the cutscenes look absolutely embarrassing
it looks like an original xbox game or even a ps game
the characters are designed decent but they have no texture
when you look at a character its a like one single flat shade with no skin texture or small variations in color
the best analogy i can give is in photoshop if you were simply to use the paint bucket tool to fill in a void with one blanket color no feathering no gradients shadows layering variations in opacity etc
just a single flat color
thats how this whole game looks
the failure is most evident in some of the noncgi cutscenes like in campaign mode which is another failure all its own
i wouldnt even be making a huge deal about it if the rest of the game was good but for reasons im about to explain with everything else failing it sure seals the deal for this game to be ugly as hell toonow for everyones biggest complaint the campaign mode
what were they thinking
this is an epic fail personified
now its been a few years but i honestly believe i had more fun in the older tekken force mode than this upgraded version of tekken force
its  now and theres no excuse for these problems in campaign modea completely broken camera systema completely broken targeting system  pressing rrb changes targets but its still broken
this is painstakingly evident when you come from playing a flawless d game like batman arkham asylum think about how smooth and easy it was to transition from enemy to enemy to thisa less serious gripe but nonetheless a gripe is how foolish it looks for the cutscenes to feature characters communicating with each other in different languages
character a says something in english and character b responds in japanese
im not saying its impossible for human beings to communicate in this manner in real life but why would you and why design the game this wayheres the number one biggest problem with this campaign mode had this just been an optional side feature then i could simply ignore this part of the game and still enjoy it
problem is theyve got this featured as your main sole source of getting gold to buy custom items for your characters
so unless you plan to play this game with no customization at all youre pretty much forced to play through this mode and grind and farm gold
i bought tekken because i like one on one fighting games
someone tell me why did the developers insist on including and forcing you to play a completely different genre of game to unlock its content
i dont want to play broken version of final fight or streets of rage i wanted to play tekken
thats like if a sports game forced you to play a mini fps game just to unlock features or an rts game making you play an optional golf game on the side to unlock more troops or something
what an absolutely horrible decision in game designhere are some other miscellaneous problems that i want to point outin most games these days if a game features prerendered cut scenes and if its a game that also happens to let your character wear different outfits it shows you wearing those different outfits in the cutscenes themselves eg soul calibur  metal gear  gta iv
well none of that here
not only does it show you and alisa in the default punch or kick outfit it doesnt even show your chosen character period
its prerendered with the default character lars
how lazy is that
character customization is a complete joke in this game and this goes back to the graphics
virtua fighter  hands down had the best most realistic looking clothes you could buy for your character it was a gorgeous game in general while soul calibur  had the deepest customization available
so one was fun due to how deeply you could tweak your fighter sc while the other was fun because no matter how petty of an upgrade you bought you looked forward to donning you character with that new piece of apparel you just bought because of how real it looked
the same can be said for sc for that matter no matter how ridiculous an item was you bought a squid sword a kitty costume a bread basket as a weapon etc it looked like it belonged in the world
so as your character holds it fighting the guy across from you you still look like an actual fighter who was insane enough to bring a shish kabob to a gunfight
compare this to tekken in which the graphics suck so bad that everything you buy justdoesnt matter
they all look like ridiculous cartoon items due to the lack of any discernible surface textures
like some single flat shaded polygon
so if youre wearing pink joker pants it doesnt look like pants that happen to be pink it just looks like a shape affixed to your body
i dont even know the right terms to describe it it just looks bad
alisas personality in campaign mode is so clicheacute
they went for this whole angle where you have this nave but sexy robot girl who doesnt quite know whats going on and speaks in japanese and her general innocence is supposed to be alluring thats not the problem
what really made her a complete joke is that in the cutscenes she speaks in japanese but in the text portions where you read her journal its in english contrary to my previous point about speaking in two different languages this isnt even the problem here
the actual problem is based on whether youre hearing her talk in japanese or reading her english texts shes portrayed with two different personalities and thats the problem
on one hand youve got the clicheacuted high pitched cutesy japanese school girl gimmick which is fine but on the other hand youve got her making deadpan introspective comments in english about her predicament and those around her in typical robotic fashion
for example shell say something in japanese to the effect of oh noes
zomg
lol
    thats cute and thats fine
but then in her text journal in english shell deliver a line something along the lines of today i encountered a man who claimed to be the greatest fighter in the world
unfortunately he was not able to demonstrate this as i rendered him unconscious a little too quickly upon physically engaging him in combat
perhaps once he awakens from his coma and departs the hospital i will have the pleasure of being able to witness his skill once gain
or something like that you get the point
heres a pet peeve of mine in all games and i complain about this in all my game reviews that feature this problem  when you pause to go to some game menu the game then doesnt let you hit circle or b to cancel out of that menu instead it makes you manually press up or down and select the return to game option and press start
thats stupid
a casual gamer may have no clue what im talking about and couldnt care less but this infuriates me
its sloppy design and just lazy
you should be able to do your thing in the pause menu then quickly press the circle or b button whatever console you own and cancel out of the menu lightning fast and return to the game not have to manually scroll to the option and press start
load times
pathetic
every singlescreen transitionhas a load time
between fights between cutscenes even between the load times themselves exist load times and thats not even logically or physically possible
were talking no less than  seconds and on the high end probably more like  seconds
another example that further makes me believe they just thew this game together  i couldve sworn that in previous games in training mode when looking at youre looking at the move list they had the moves separated into different categories based on the type of move it was
here they just globbed it all together in one undifferentiable mess
its not that i cant make sense of it or read it i just hate that they cut yet another corner in this piece of crap game
the online modei havent seen an online mode this broken sincenba k and nba k
netcode  fail
why are tekken characters legs so wide
look at jin for example
not a complaint whatsoever just a little thing i happened to notice
the only two positives things about the game is that in its standard mode its still the same old tekken fighting engine which ironically i just got tired of but thats besides the point so if youve been a fan of tekken youll have little to complain about here
the other is that being how they were lazy with practically everything else im absolutely shocked that they have character sensitive dialogue in campaign mode the dialogue between you alisa and the bosses on each level are completely different based on the character you have chosenso theres my angry review of this game
makes me wonder wtf were they doing the last two years
why is the online broken
why did they spend so much time on a game mode that no one likes and even thats broken
why does a game that came out three years ago look three times as better virtua fighter 
why did i waste my vacation days playing thisthis game was released in the arcades in  and ported on the nes the following year making it one of capcoms earliest titles
capcom usually creates great quality games which is the case for this title graphics colors and controls were amazing for 
why am i hard on this
the first reason why is that its unfairly difficult to play and it requires superhuman strategies to even complete the first level
you are literally bombarded with several fast responding enemies to ward off and your weapon upgrades are more like downgrades get the knife and ignore the flamessince when is a puny knife stronger than a flame
that reoccurring flying devil is a pain in the you know what to get rid of because he swoops in all different angles and takes many hits to defeat
two hits and youre dead and your character is an easy target
second reason is that the game play and levels are so damn repetitive
when i use to play it i would easily get bored after finishing the first level
the game has very little variety in gameplay and that defeats the fun of a game suppose to be for kids who dont have very good attention spans
the third reason why im hard on this game are the many glitches and many trial and error moves that are associated with it especially in the later levels
if you miss picking up the shield on the last level you wont face the final boss you will automatically be warped back to level 
though the shield is a weak weapon you must use it to defeat the two satans and the final boss and so you dont go back to the previous level
not that it matters but you start the game over after you defeat the final boss because what you just accomplished was just an illusion one of the cruelest pranks in video game history
thats right you have to beat the game one more time to really beat it
after that i just gave up yes i used game genie to attempt to beat the game before i got punked and sold the game to funco land now game stopif youre a frustrated gamer with an average amount of paitence then leave the game alone
i dont recommend it for first time gamers even those who want to build their nes collection
this game is a horrible trick and whats bad is that its made by capcom and it looked like it couldve been an exciting game but the game developers were just messing around to cash ini just dont get it
the dbz games have been hit and miss for as long as theyve been made even in japan on the super famicom and that disappointing tradition continued into the sony playstation and the ps as game developers continued to display loudly that they have no idea what fans see in dbz and arent desperate enough to ask
thats the only possible reason why so much dbz stuff is trashstill up until budokai tenkaichi it at least seemed like they were trying to get it right
budokai  and  were mediocre at best and budokai  was good but not perfect
tenkaichi improved the flying engine no end destroyed the fighting mechanics of the game and messily murdered the character variety by including umteen million characters that all have the exact same special movesthis game is new but its still worse than either of those games both of which i was already quite disappointed with on a dbz power level scale
budokai  used experience gaining to enable character modifications in the game itself and if those modifications were nowhere near as extreme as they were in the series they were still better than in tenkaichi which tried to do the same thing with item fusions
dbz has if youve ever watched the show or read the manga had very little to do with itemsno dbz is an anime and manga about characters whove pushed the strength speed and endurance of their bodies to cosmic levels over the course of a few decades as its measured in the manga using weights training equipment complex exercises and martial arts
at this level they find themselves with the speed to seemingly teleport from place to place and commanding bioenergies than give them the power to fly and destroy entire planets
as you might imagine some of their fights are pretty spectacularbut the real meat of the dbz storyline isnt about the fighting but rather about characters trembling in fear of one anothers strength or training desperately for those last few ounces of power needed to defeat a particular foe
thats why i consider budokai  to be a fighting game success but a dbz failure
the changes in power level over the course of the game were toned down from the anime to make the matches more even and possibly limit play time
it was after all a fighting game not an rpgthats really the big problem with this game as well
its a fighting game not an rpg
it does contain experience points as well as a meter labeled bp but neither really seems to do much aside from unlocking a few new special moves for each character
in dbz the anime frieza with a power level of  thousand fought nail with a power level of  thousand
naturally nails strongest attacks did no damage at all and friezas strength was so monstrous that he crippled nail in just a few blowsbut in super dbz a character with a power level in the millions has only a slight advantage over a character with a power level of only  thousand or even lower
yes i would like to see that changed although the only way to really do it would be by making dbz into an actual rpgthe concept is so enticing in fact of dbz actually achieving its potential as a video game that i went to the trouble once of writing up design specs for how id design it but i wont do that hereaside from that primary gripe of mine there are also lesser gripes i have with this game
compared with other dbz games this game is pathetically small
the flight engine is toned down from tenkaichi and there are fewer characters and fewer moves and transformations than in any other ps dbz game as far as i can tell
as i said smallso when so many other better bigger dbz games have already been released what hole did they expect this game to fill
certainly it didnt fix the central problem that all other dbz games have had up to this point and it detracted from many other aspects of those games
what a disappointment
im glad i always rent before buying
this game is my perfect justification in that respectmy wife will swear that sudoku is fun but coming from a background of more epic stuff mario and zelda you can understand why i dont see her point
true enough sudoku has its fair share of supporters but whether it warrants a video game on its own remains questionable
that however doesnt stop the tons of sudokurelated games on handheld consoles over the past few months
the likes of go
sudoku and dr sudoku have made their rounds on the psp and gba respectively and even the immensely popular brain age has a section devoted entirely to the game itself
sudoku gridmaster released as a budget title is the latest kid on the blockas the core gameplay of sudoku never changes the things that separate sudoku gridmaster and other sudoku video games are therefore purely cosmetic
you wont find any groundbreaking graphical presentation here but at least the game tries to reduce the blandness by offering a small variety of backgrounds for the player to choose from
the soundtracks are also changeable even though they tend to be rather distracting when the going gets tough
and trust me the puzzles in sudoku gridmaster are tough
the game offers over  sudoku puzzles spanning four difficulty levels and the higher level ones may stump even the most seasoned player
if you go into the game expecting to breeze through the levels be warnedthe game allows two modes of input
the first is the direct writing method which is popularized by brain age
in fact this method of input is very similar to brain ages
the player basically touches a square and writes the answer on it
unfortunately the usual recognition issue does surface here though
for example the game doesnt quite recognise my  properly and treats it as a  instead
this is why a second method of input is included i guess
this approach allows the player to choose a square and then choose a number to be keyed into it
this will suit players who have problems getting their handwriting to work on the touch screen but its somehow less fluid as compared to just writing the numbers inregardless of which method you choose you will play each puzzle with a timer
youll then be ranked according to how well you do
theres also an option to save and exit a puzzle at anytime allowing you to return later to have a go again from the saved point
this is perfect for a handheld since youd expect plenty of ontherun playfor all its efforts to make sudoku more fun than your usual pen and paper game sudoku gridmaster has a fundamental flaw
a player can easily cheat by stopping the game sorting out the puzzle on the top screen and then resuming and keying in the answers on the touch screen without sacrificing ingame time
although this defeats the purpose altogether the fact that a feature like this exists may just be tempting enough for players who simply want a high score for every puzzlethe sheer number of puzzles available in sudoku gridmaster will satisfy fans of the game
for others however the game may be less enjoyable
backgrounds and soundtracks aside sudoku is basically just sudoku
if solving sudoku puzzles is all you wanted stick to pen and paper insteadthe original coh was great until this expansion comes out
opposing fronts is extremely buggy
the game freezes all the time
worse after you kill the frozen game it wont recognize your dvd any more
so you have to reinstall it
worse yet the updates cannot be downloaded into your hard drive so you will have to wait for the mb download every time you do the reinstallation
if you think this is frustrating enough you have not seen half of it yet
the panzer elite faction in this expansion was made super strong as in the super human sense
even a newbie playing panzer elite can easily and i mean easily defeat a veteran of the original game
i suppose the vendor wants to make sure you buy the new package instead of staying with the old coh
to make sure you absolutely do not have that option they also force you to play against panzer elite in multiplayer setting
there is no way to opt outand to add insult to injury they sell the expansion pack as a standalone ie
full price
after i bite the bullet and pay up i realize that i still cannot get the great gaming experience back because everyone else in the multiplayer lobby wants to play panzer elte and two such players cannot play against each other
so i either have to join the other  players in waiting for a clueless cannon fodder to come along or i have to be that cannon fodder
either way it is no funyes thats what it says in the box on my screen  as gothic  crashes
id like to know where he is myself and if i find him hes in big troubleplenty of bugs in this releasedtooearly game and despite what defenders of the game say they are not all graphics related
examples you meet an npc and his dialogue is silent you cant hear it you select a line of dialogue  your character speaks a different line of dialogue no matter what you do your character cant lock onto the attacking animal  you clobber a friendly npc instead or you cant do anything game crashes and then there are the graphics related problems  stuck in solid objects animals and orcs stuck in walls point of view spins wildly and you end up looking upwards from inside your characterbalance is a huge problem
there seems to be no npc capable of defeating any animal
the mighter hunter of faren cant deal with a single lurker rathgar the mighty warrior cant handle a single wolf
you cant handle animals  the stun lock problem has already been discussed
on the other hand huge armies of orcs are no problem at all because you fight them one at a time as you lock on to them while the others pretty much wait their turn
the problem of locking on to the attacking animal or npc means that you hit a friendly and then the friendlies attack you
more amusing even the friendlies have a problem locking on correctly and then they end up killing each other
after gotha was all solved gorn was killed by orcs when wolves attacked guess he hit an orc instead of a wolf oh well
hope i wont need him for anything elseand as has been mentioned elsewhere save and load are iiinnncccrrrreeeddddiiiiibbbbbllllllyyyy slow
you have to play with a good book in your hand or while watching tv because youll be saving and loading oftenmany of the quests are either dumb or dumbed down which takes a lot of fun out of the game
theres nothing puzzling and there is no moment when it is at all unclear what you are supposed to do
makes things a little tediouscombat involves left clicking as fast as you can or finding a spot to plug arrows into animals and npcs that obligingly return to exactly the same spot so you can shoot them again
the great horrible demon of gotha that decimated an entire town of paladins can be killed by a level one player by shooting arrows into him as he stands in the entryway to the castlehowever the graphics are pretty and the game world is large which is nice for exploring
i havent had the corrupted save games problem that others have mentioned thank inos
and i keep playing the thing so i suppose i must be getting some entertainment value of it
but the problems involved keep it from being one of those engrossing games where you get lost for hours
its more something to do for a half an hour while taking a break from cleaning the kitchen
too badi am a big fan of openworld rpgs and dont get me wrong gothic  delivers that large world greatly but it does have flaws that completely killed the gaming experience for methe goodlarge open worldloads of side quests to dokilling king rhobar king zuben and xardas was a blast with some nice lootexploring can pay off pretty wellthe badthe time it took out of my life to get the community patches to make the game playablethe game is so open that it is rather difficult to find what to dowhen you discover locations on your map it is not marked so you can easily forget how to get backenemies are easy and predictable unless you try to melee an ogre it is so hard lolif you go about and kill all three main leaders in the game you cannot beat it without cheatsthose are the things in this game that killed it for me but hey its  bucks worth a shot ehi have finally played this
with all of the bad reviews i avoided buying this
then i got for free so i am playing it
to put it as bluntly as i can gothic  is just not very goodim running gb ram and a nvidia geforce gtx mb
so if my system isnt up to snuff then the problems are in the programming especially since this game is  years old
the first problem are the savingloading times
can you call it a quick save when it takes  seconds or longer to process it
and load times are horrendous
i havent clocked them but  minutes has to be the minimum
its a good thing that most of the game is easy but it makes the few difficult areas unnecessarily frustrating since you play for a few seconds then wait  minutes for another shotthen comes the stuttering
the transition between areas is terrible often locking the game up for several seconds as you cross the invisible barriers
or it starts strobing after loading the new area
everyone talked about how this was supposed to an oblivionkiller but i never ran into these problems with oblivion and i have a mb video card and mb ram back when i played itthen comes the lie of nonlinear game play
it actually is quite linear
while you dont have to play the game in the same exact order every time there are only  ways to play the game
run across the whole map killing orcs and animals or complete the quests one at a time before being given a reason to move to the next map area
this is nonlinear in the same way fallout was nonlinear
you have complete freedom of movement to anywhere on the map but if you go in the wrong order either certain options are closed to you or your foes are more difficult than they should be
rpgs like fallout  are getting closer to nonlinear of course fallout  suffers many of the same other issues discussed for gothic  so its not really a recommendationdialog this suffers the same problem that so many other foreign games suffer from
instead of using a german that speaksreads english hire an american or canadian i guess to interpret it from german
here in america we have contractions you are is youre i am is im etc
dialog without contractions is rigid  false sounding
im also not a big fan of dialog that takes you by the hand and explains everything like you are a year old
and dialog is another place where the nonlinear gameplay falls on its face
you have no real options in conversation
sure you can choose the order you ask questions and make statements but there are no choices on how to ask the questions or make the statements
i am asking the exact same question to the exact same npc at the exact same point in the game as every other playerlets see whats left
oh yes character generation and progression
first there is no generation
not even a choice of avatars or gender not that i would play a woman
i am not a big fan of spending obscene amounts of money for progression
i havent decided if they put too money in the game and use the progression system to control that  gold from a rebel agent for a wornout weapon that only orcs can use
and i have  of them from one battle
but now i have to pay  for a tier  skill or if they created the buy a level system and then overinflated the economics to account for it
either way i dont like itthe concept behind the progression system is good for crpgs
any time you have a game designed around a single character you have to give the opportunity to have more than one area of expertise finding a proper combination of combat thieving and magic
but this was not innovated by gothic  and this is not best interpretation of it either so i the only credit i can give is that it exists herefinally the story line the plot and the heart of any rpgthere is none to speak of
orcs have taken over and as a human you choose to help either the human rebels trying to take back their land or side with the evil orcs to destroy the rebellion
gee thats original
but at least they did it in a new and fresh way
no wait they didnt
in fact its about as typical as i have ever seento summarize graphics  not even the best at its time of release and down right plain by todays standards sound  nothing groundbreaking dialog is poorly interpreted and i turned the music all the way off after a few minutes story  played out unoriginal poorly executed programming  poor unstable sub par even in its daygothic  and   for those who has the skill and patient to finish the games  totally redefined the rpg experience and are simply awsome beyond wordgothic  shares some of the earlier elements of its predecessors most notable is a mysterious and nameless quality of immersion factor that keep you hooked despite the horrendous bugs
however the gothic s bugs are unforgivable and apparently unfixable  unless someone rewrites the entire programming codes
if you read the other reviews  and please do  you already have a good ideas of whats wrong with this game so ill just elaborate on a few major negative points that is no matter what you do  patches ini fix  whatever  youll still have these problems to some degree stunlock some animal will strike you so fast that you cannot do anything including running away
the patches tried like hell to fix this problem but simply fail
the weird thing is that this problem look like its sytem specific
eg
i have problem with wolves and jackals while my friend  and most other people  have problems with the boars uneven enemies levels animal are too hard to kill while humanoid anything walking on two legs except for trolls are too easy
humanoid enemies can easily be stunlocked by you
that is button mashing will kill virtually anybody bosses included
i wiped out an entire town on level  very hard but certainly doable
you got to try it to believe it
on the same token its both hilarious and depressing because you just know the game you tried hard to love is broken beyond repair to see a squad of elite orc warriors getting trashed by a single boar false innovation unlike what the game claims and some people would like to believe you cannot do whatever you want in gothic  yes there are great freedom but there are unintended consequences
possible spoilerfor example if you decided to be a hard core rebel bending on eliminating the orc from the beginning of the game and destroy more than  orc towns one of the main questrelated characters will just attack you and fight to the death
thus rendering the main quest broken
the developer have admitted to this screwup but there is no fix for it
end spoiler unrealistic game world granted most of the environment are detailed and beautiful but a few things are horrible these may be pet peeves  but please hear me out
first most npcs dont really talk to you you hear a respond and sometimes a hand gesture but there is no dialog box and neither are the npcs lips are moving nor is heshe looking at yousecondly talking about she there are not enough women in the game world to make me believe that this world is real and alive
this is suppose to be a continent not a military base camp or a prison colony
there a more women on the island of khorinis gothic  and probably in the original prison colony gothic  than the entire continent of gothic in conclusion gothic  is not a bad game but it is far from being a good one
as a result pyranha bytes the game developer is history
what that means is that  most likely  there will be no more official patch for this game ver  is the last official patch beside home made ones from the ever faithful gothic community i am in itin the inevitable comparison to oblivion i played both gothic  seems to be more fun in most aspects
on the other hand oblivion is so far ahead in being a polished sophisticated and well thoughtout game that it makes gothic  looks shameful
if you must know gothic  is still the king of the hill of rpg in my bookin spite of my bashing i thoroughly enjoyed gothic  as a great free roaming adventure game with some rpg elements thrown in for good measure
at the current price of  as of  gothic  is a great dealedit  i just started playing gothic  again with the community patch  installed
it is now a much improved game
granted the major problems that i listed still persist  bit it has diminished quite noticeably
thanks to the gothic community you guys rockthis games is a throw back to the doom days
i remember doom not because i thought it was a great game but because the first time i played it it made me sick and puke because of the visual issue we have come to know from the epilepsy warning we see on most games now
if you feel yourself geting sick stop playing your brain is having a mild seizure brought about by the way the visual cues are comming to you from game playi had to unistall and cant play it
it might have been a fun game but not for mehail flaviusi was so excited for spore but the end result was disappointingly shallow and vapid
once youve played it through once or twice theres no reason to continuethe first few ages are fun the latter few not quite so much
the space stage is the one that has the main meat of the game but unfortunately again its very shallow and once youve played it for an hour or two youll have seen all the game has to offerfor shame maxis
for shame eai played spore on my friends computer for about an hour
he told me to keep playing because it would become fun
all i can say is it should have become fun faster
the beginning of the game is so pointless so slow
i couldnt make it to the rest of the game
its more like lets play dress up instead of a real game
i dont even think the creature creator is that good
i get so frustrated trying to create the shape i want or the look i want
overall i think it is an interesting topic but better left to the science books
sorry will not this timethe good beautiful colors and graphics
unique game that is fun to play for a whilethe bad ea put too much hype out there about it for way too long
they had everyone drooling over this games possibilities for years
talking like if gamers played this game every day all day it would take almost  years for them to explore all the games possible stars in the galaxy
and of course when the makers of sims say something like that its very believable and appealing
but the game just didnt live up to the hypethe main goals in this game are eating growing and evolving
theres not much more to do then that except picking fights and making friendssummary its a fun game but i think they made it out to be more then it isfirst off let me state that i did not purchase the standard retail version of this game
i had heard all about the retarded drm scheme guaranteed to piss off paying customers while not affecting pirates in the slightest
i was determined to avoid this at all costs and i didwhen ea announced it would allow spore to be bought on steam using only steam as the drm i found that acceptable and they discounted the price so i got a much cheaper and better deal than if i had gone to a retail storeive installed it and played the game a bit and it is fun but only for a while and then its just old
the game as promised back in late early  was an exciting game concept that would allow you to create a creature have it evolve and your abilities would depend on how you evolved it
the end result is a simplistic minigame collection thats loosely related to each otherthe cell stage is fun but its over in  minutes or lessthats good though because there really isnt much to do in the cell stage but eat or be eaten and to collect parts
speaking of parts theres only  kinds of mouths  kinds of weapons  kinds of eyes and  kinds of movement appendages
 pieces to get in totalyou start out as a herbivore or a carnivore
if you want the ability to eat both you either have to kill a cell with the omnivore mouth part or you have to put two mouths on your creature one carnivore and one herbivoreafter you have grown a certain number of times it tells you that youve grown a brain and its time to move to land
you get  choices of feet to add and you only have enough points to add one pair of legs at this point so everyone pretty much looks so much like the same damn creature i say to them you want ice cream cone
and they all say yesduring each phase youre presented with a short tutorial on the movement keys and other simple tasks but annoyingly enough these have never gone away for me yes i know press the middle mouse button or the left and right buttons together to move the camera
you dont have to tell me every damn time i play the game but you do anyway
edit i have discovered that you can shut the tutorials offi expected it would play once or twice and then stop but instead its an option in a menu i didnt seeso anyway after the cell phase it tells you what you are by your actions herbivore if you ate mostly plants carnivore if you ate mostly meat and omnivore if you mixed it upbut if you just change your mouth part before you go to land it doesnt matter what the game said you were as a cell
also based on your food type you earn a special ability for the next phase
this isnt changeable so it might be worth figuring out what the bonuses are before you play so you can aim for the right dietthe game only lets you have the mouth parts that you are supposed to have for each type and you only get  basic types of mouths to start with in each type
if you try to eat meat as a herbivore or plants as a carnivore itll make your creature vomit and tell you you cant do that
however if you have the omnivore part from the cell stage still on your creature you can eat both no matter whatafter a while of scrounging for skeletons which glow so you cant miss it so you can earn new parts or killing alpha creatures in other types you can edit your creature
unfortunately theres no penalty for selling off everything on your creature so you can totally rebuild your creature from scratch every time you mate
evolutions
i dont think sothere are a few bonuses like epic creatures that you can kill or more likely be killed by and some rogue creatures that give you a big bonus in points if you befriend or kill it but for the most part you start off in the neighborhood of puny hp monsters work your way up to the hp monsters and then the hp monsterslike others have said the creature creation is  cosmetic and only  of it is about function
if you give your character  legs the only difference is that you spent more points and he walks funny
you could put one leg on him and hed be just as fast and youd have more points for weapons and stuff that allowed your creature to be socialafter youve befriended or extincted enough other creatures youd have a grand total of maybe  points to spend in the creature creator one last time before you went to the tribal stage
at this point most of the stats that were important in creature stage are irrelevant in tribal so you might as well remake your creature to look the way you wanttribal stage bills itself as a sort of rts mode but it does so very poorly
the crappiest rts game is better than this
based on your performance in the cell stage and in the creature stage youre awarded extra abilities in tribal
now you have two abilities like for example as a herbivore you can call a refreshing rain to help make the plants grow more fruit and as a social character in creature stage you earn the ability to shoot fireworks to temporarily impress other tribesso you hurry up and beat the other  or  tribes into a pulp i dont remember or befriend them and you gain their tools as you do which in turn helps you beat the next tribe
after that you go to the civilization stage
this is where it gets really boring for menow based on the way you reacted the game classifies you as either a fighter a trader or a religious type and you get abilities from that as well
fighters get to attack other cities traders set up trade routes and religious types have to convert citiesthis is nothing like civilization though
its like another rts only this one is more boring
its even worse because as fun as it is to design a creature its boring as hell to design a house or a vehicle or whatever
unlike the other creator tools i felt like this was a chore and i didnt want to spend too much time working to make the building look really cool because ultimately it was  cosmetic
nothing you did had any real effectvehicles were slightly different because each piece would either add to your attack power health or speed but now the ratio of each part to the others is what determines how good your vehicle is
again youre restricted in the type of parts you can use based on what kind of nation you are running but the basics are all the sameso you simply take over all the cities on your planet and then you can move to the last stage
i wont comment on that since i havent been bothered to play one civilization long enough to get there but im not motivated by the game to work on it
at this stage they should have changed the name from spore to chore because its not fun or interestingwhile many others have elected to give this game poor marks because of the drm i gave it poor marks because it had so much promise in the early stages of its development and then they sucked the life out of it to turn it into a collection of minigamestages that are loosely connectedi wanted the game will wright was showing off in update  i finally finished the civ stage
i dont know why it was so annoying before but this time i blasted right through it even earning the military strongman achievement even though i was a religious nationafter that i was treated to the space stage and this is why everyone wants the game really
the first  stages are nothing compared to the last stage
you cant just jump to the last stage though until you get there normallywhen you finally get there you have a lot of exploring to do hidden stuff to find special galactic formations wormholes etc
this too is fun for a while but im eventually going to get bored of fightingbribing and buying my way to the center of the galaxycreepy  cute expansion pack
no i think those are lame ideas
its like you bought a barbie doll and now they want to sell you new clothing
it wont add enough to the gamesorry for this being so long
thanks for reading if you made it this fari bought this game the day it was released expecting a fun challenging and invigorating adventure
i was mistaken
the first time around this game is fun but after that its just not worth playing anymore it gets really boring really fast
despite what other reviews may say in my opinion this game almost completely lacks replay value
aside from using and seeing different creatures the game plays out exactly the same every timenot only that but the stages are too quick simple and leave no room to try something different
i completed the tribal phase and the civilization phase in less that an hour total this is more of a demo for multiple games rather than one whole experiencewhile the creature creator is an incredible work of art and a feat of customization that has yet to be matched the use of these creatures is greatly hindered by the narrow scope of the gamethe only phase that has any depth the space phase lacks instruction and will leave any player confused
even on the games easiest difficulty it can prove complicated and challenging and it like the games other phases leaves a lot to be desiredi really wanted to like this game but i cannot
it is too simple  too repetitive and not worth the  ea is charging for it
while i do believe spore did open a door to a new and exciting genre of games it  itself is more of a proof of concept for whats to come rather than a complete gameps i did not mention the games drm because its affects are noted elsewhere this is a review for the game not eas bad decisionsps if youre looking for a somewhat similar game with an incredible amount of replay value i would highly recommendsid meiers civilization iv it is one of the best game i have ever playedas mentioned in some posts spore was supposed to be revolutionary in a lot of ways
this was a game of life
you were going to grow evolve and attempt to become a dominant species in many different aspects
my best advice for gamers who still have not gotten their hands on it is to try not to get your hopes up too much
you will be done with this title faster than a softserve ice cream coneagain spore is supposed to be a game about life and evolving yourself as a creature
you will encounter  different stages in this game cellular creature tribe civilization and space
each has a different style of game play and different look to itthere are two very noticeable aspects to this game that are definitely pros
first the game is very pretty
you will notice this first when you are in the cellular level
out of all  levels this is the one i spent the rd most time on and have come back to many many times
you will want to spend a lot of time on itbut cannotwe will talk about that later
the one i spent the nd most amount of time on was the creature stage which is also very prettythe second aspect that excited gamers and still keeps them playing is the customization of well just about everything in the game
you have the power to create any creature vehicle and building you want in the game
the most awesome part is that it is not solely aesthetic either
the very advanced creative engine helps you to make creature that will use all their limbs the way a creature with those proportions would
this is physics to a whole new level folks
the same goes with vehicles
you can make boats planes and land craft that move however you want them to
i remember making my own mech just like in the game mechwarrior and it moved like it too
the possibilities are simply endlessanother awesome aspect about the endless creations are that you can share them with many different spore users on the net
it is literally a fan made universewith all this glimmer you must be wondering how can spore be receiving these horrible reviews including yours
well it comes down to this folks  gameplay in itself lacks serious depth and you will pass through each level probably faster than you would like no matter what difficulty you are onall except for the space stage and you will be begging for that one to be over withit all starts with the cell stage
as you grow you do not get the same pleasure the other ginormous creatures get eating you
you grow very fast and next thing you know you are forced to go on land
the creature stage is one of the longer stages and one of the most fun however in a game of evolution and ecology it seriously lacks depth
i would have loved to have seen hundreds of different creatures running around slowly trying to manage their region etc
and then giving you the decision how you want to evolve
should you grow in intelligence or size
but that is not what happens in this game
you are then thrown to your next levelnow it may seem exciting to come to the point where you can make vehicles and really get some strategy into play but that isnt going to happen
you might deck out a vehicle with  guns and expect it to be a massive killing machine but the only result is a small boost in killing power
in fact only  of those guns will actually fire
sad right
customization in this game including that of your creature is only face level most of the time and has little impact on the strength of your creature vehicle or buildingeach subsequent level goes by faster and lacks more and more depth
then you get to the space stage
this is a simply endless level that has you running around doing tasks and will force you to ultimately run back and forth defending your planets from invaders like crazy
where does it end
you can try to find the center of the universe where a cutscene will talk to you and then you can continue on the gameso should you buy it or not
this is the first time that i have ever given a game such a low rating and yet been hesitant to say no
the reason is that there is potential for some to get enjoyment simply out of the endless creations they can make
in fact before the game came out there were already thousands of creatures made on the creature creator
there is a lot of enjoyment in the music funny creatures and awesome vehicles that can be created but for those that are looking to do more and not create more your enjoyment will be over before you know itin brief if you are a creative person and love the fact that you can make your own buildings creatures and vehicles then the game is perfect for you and you can expect to get minutes hours days and months worth of enjoyment out of it
you people should buy it
for those of you who are not i still recommend trying it but maybe watch it at a friends house or borrow itwhen reading the previews and even the mainstream reviews of spore the game seems to be one of the most creative and revolutionary games of our time at least as far as creativity
sadly i feel for these previews and reviews as well
i even went against my better judgement and bought the game with its horrible drm and limited activation policies
drm is not the only flaw found in this gamethe game is set up with several different gameplay modes and while fun for a temporay time is nothing more than what you get from a casual game
the first stage is a very easy pacman type game without the maze
you collect body parts to add to your creature developing its form as a carnivor or veggie lover
the obstacles
other creatures are trying to collect parts too
however anyone thats played a game before will not have any trouble not dying
afterwards you get to run around on land and develop your creature while trying to friend or enemy other creatures on the island
this is pretty simple stuff too
really after this section the game just turns into more creating for your own type of creature
thats probably the best thing about the game is buildings vehicles and creatures are fully developed by you as much as you can with their decent variety of addons
the problem with this
the ai is horrible and very easyreally the game turns into a basic casual game right after you mess around with creature creator
actually thats about the time the fun ends
the only fun thing to do is develope your character
otherwise the rts elements in this game likes any strength
this was a serious problem for me and ive hardly touched the game since day oneanother thing that was highly disappointing is the lack of any multi player
you can only fight against other horrible ai units that are incredible dumb and predictable
this game had to have been made for children or simple peopleon top of that yes the game is infected with drm and the most dreadful pc gaming experience on the planet limited activations
if low pc game sales are the effect of software piracy then these horrible measures taken only on the ones purchasing the game are the effect of piracy
id like to point out that the pirates cracked the game before the game came out
now who is the loser in this situation
the person who bought the game and is limited to so many installs
or the person who spend nothing on it and has unlimited installsit needs to be said spore is a very solid fun exciting game that blends genres and empowers users to be incredibly creative
but spore has become synonymous with eas perceived greed and ineptitudethe digital rights management drm in spore has come under a lot of fire and for good reason since it limits the number of copies you can use
reinstalls can count against this and getting extra licenses is problematic
i dont think any legit gamer has a problem with companies protecting their games from piracy but spore took it way too far
games like fallout  also have limited drm but nothing so extreme and customerunfriendly as spore
hopefully ea will realize this but the company doesnt have a great reputationand based on spore it doesnt deserve one
the games second main failure which some argue is related to the first is its major instability
i just upgraded to a better computer only to find the game no longer functions even with updated drivers
based on the vast number of customer complaints of crashes and issues it really is impossible to say if the game will for sure work on your system or notbut all problems aside the game is fun and enjoyable
is it a masterpiece like the sims
honestly no
first it is rediculously easy
the creatre and tribe stages dont seem to last long enough or provide nearly enough depth
second the space game where youll spend the most time can quickly become stale and reptititive and while it can be fun to experiment and see other players creations this probably wont keep you playingeven if the game worked perfectly i would give spore the respect it deserves as an innovative step in player generated content but would not consider it a masterpiece of gamemaking
but with all of the very real very numerous problems that ea has basically ignored instead opting to create an expansion pack i cant help but suggest that some people will pirate the game just to see if it will work on their system before theyd invest in something that might not even workof course id never suggest anyone do anything illegalbut for all their work in keeping the game copyright protected and hurting legitmate customers this is one game where pirating it before buying it would actually be beneficial since theres a good chance it will randomly crash or be unplayable on your systemif you like installing a game and having it install a copy protection program which will remain on your computer long after you uninstall the game you have to reformat the hard drive to get rid of it spore is for youthe game itself is decent and its broken up into five stages
the first is trivial but since the game is new to the player its not awful
stage two is either a lame simon says program or a trivially simple mini combat game
after that the game becomes a fairly average rts
in spore you get to choose parts for your creature then dress them up then choose the look of buildings and vehicles
none of it is terrible none of it is the great new thing many people expected
gameplay is safe some fun but nothing excitingwhich makes spore an overpriced fairly average realtimestrategy game with pretty pictures and an offensive digital rights management tool which you might see mentioned elsewhere in the reviews
spores copyright scheme reminds me of a guy who parks a totally ordinary sports car diagonally across two spaces because he thinks its the greatest thing there isthis is not a mazis excuse me maxis game which you can expect to be playing years from now
not quite snore
not quite special
one parking space would have been plentyfirst the drm system is annoying and draconian
i resent being treated like a thief for a game that is so expensive and it just really puts me offlet me say that parts of this game are quite fun to my  year old son
he enjoys building the creatures boats planes houses etc
that are in the game
he enjoys the tribal stage the best where he gets to run or glide around fight with other tribes and collect goodies
and he was very happy when he found all the cheats on the internet so that he could skip through the long boring sections of building up wealthbut thats about it
he complains that he cant just make whatever creature he wants and play with it in different stages
the game is very restrictive and doesnt seem to support the idea that someone might just want to play around without having to play to the games objectiveoverall my son has enjoyed playing with the creature creator more than spore itself
he just wishes that in creature creator he could do more with the creatures hes madeim not sure what the hype is all about and if i had it to do again id skip itspore itself is a fun game
heres where i think the game is horrible thoughgame reviewit took  hours to finish all the content and beat the game sure i could wander around the galaxy for another  years of my life but at this point all im doing is exploring as ive finished the story and quests now its all kill this or that repeatsproduct reviewea created this game and during the install it added a backdoor securerom this product has installed rootkits that have put machines at risk in the past
also  i installed the game on my gaming laptop the laptop had a problem and i had to replace the harddrive
in the meantime i was playing it on my desktop
that means ive installed it x on my laptop a nd time on my desktop while my laptop was being worked on and now that ive got my laptop back i did the rd install
ea has included in this product a  install maximum
the game will not play after the rd install and it verifies your installs before the game will play by contacting a server that ea owns
in order to install this game again if i was to run into issues with anything on my computer i would have to contact eas support which i have done in regards to rockband and trust me the experience was horrible and took  weeks and  days to get a response when i called in and talked to their tech support
once you call in you have to provide a reciept proving you purchased the product as well as a slew of personal information verifying who you are
in the future if ea decides this service isnt worth while they reserved the right to quit giving itbasicly youll be paying  dollars to rent a product that you cant install if they disable this verification process and youve payed them to install a backdoor product known to cause issues with cddvd writers and install rootkitsits just not fun
no real strategy and you can complete the game in about  hours
it is like a  hour advanced character creatorthe anticipation level for spore was off the charts
the initial demos at game developers conference gdc  and gdc  were extremely exciting
however as time passed and the production dragged on it became clearer and clearer that the game was changing and not for the better
it was being simplified and dumbed down
despite all the warning signs i bought spore on the day it came out
i couldnt help it
i still hoped it would be at least somewhat as deep as it looked initially
sadly though it was not
the first stage of the game was fun for what it was but each successive stage became more and more boring as you realized the gameplay options for each stage was profoundly limited with each being a watereddown version of another game typethe space stage looked to finally open things up but it was incredibly frustrating with endless pirate attacks environmental disasters and wars preventing you from actually exploring the universe and the fact that you only got to control one lousy space ship to do all your work making it quite inefficient as an empirebuilding game
they put out a patch which partially fixed the problems but it was just a little bandage compared to the generally lameness of it alli was really disappointed that you couldnt affect the attributes of your creature such as attack power and speed through your actual design but instead had to keep upgrading individual parts especially since in order to complete the creature stage you needed to be near the top in some categories
this meant that a lot of your creatures ended up looking the same by the end of that stage
it took away a huge chunk of the possible creatively
its pretty clear that what happened was that will wright came up with an amazing idea but then passed it off to others who didnt have the same vision that he did
the fact is that some of his best ideas like procedurally generated actions physics actually factoring into creature design and a much deeper conceptual basis for the game were cast aside in favor of attempting to turn it into another familyfriendly game a la the simsthe only good thing that came out of the experience of buying this game for me was that i learned to no longer give into the hype for new games
thanks to this ive avoided buying numerous sequels such as the sims  starcraft  modern warfare  and mass effect   i still have plenty of games to play but i havent had that depressing feeling of disappointment again since i bought thisthis game is fun but not as fun and compelling as it could have been  the creature stage is good sometimes walking on a planet you will be amazed by the landscape and effects  in the tribal and civ you will lose the connection with your creatures and they will be only icons in a very simple sketch of a rts and civ  the space phase is addictive but the sheer dumbness of extremely repetitive ecodisasters and attacks is annoying  evolution is purely cosmetic
you can play as a high complex dragon or as a purple blob and it will be the same game just a bit harder  will wright says he aimed at casual gamers
seems more he aimed at no one
most stages arent addictive enough except the space to the bejeweled crowd and they arent good enough to attract more experienced gamers the hardcoresso while the game is fun it is a game you wont believe someone spent six years working on
most of it is absurdly simplei bought the galactic edition and that was a waste of money
a quick boring makingof dvd a natgeo program everyone else saw on tv and a poor made artbook
ill not even talk about the scam that is the drm
i hope someone sues ea for thatspore could have been a great game
it could have been exciting entertaining and indepth
however ea deliberately dumbeddown the game hoping to appeal to a wider audience
with the creature creator simplified to nothing more than paper dolls with window dressing theres really no reason to play spore
im sorry but id rather play any number of free pointandclick flash games than the dumbeddown pacman thats stage   id rather play any one of the thousands of thirdperson action games than the oversimplified dumbeddown pa game thats stage   id rather play any one of the hundreds of great rts games on the market than the oversimplified dumbeddown rts thats stage   id rather play civ ii iii or iv than the oversimplified dumbeddown x game thats stage   and id rather play any number of moremundaneworkthanfun mmorpg games than the repetitive cookiecuttergrindquest galaxy stagespore is a game for people who dont play games
its simply uninteresting uninspired and clearly aimed at people who are unaware of unable to or unwilling to play the hundreds of deeper more rewarding games that spore has so clumsily aped for each of its stagesoh and the drm is pretty lame but every else has that coveredi have been waiting for spore since the first previews of the game and now that i have it i have to say that im disappointed
the game that i first saw was something amazing  it was supposed to be this procedurally generated world full of creatures made my people all around the world
it was supposed to be rich and intelligent responding to your playing style
it was supposed to be indepth  rising from the level of a tiny cell all the way up to a space empire in a galaxy full of life
it was supposed to be so amazing
but now that ive played it its nothing like it should have been
im so disappointed in maxis in ea and in will wright
i dont understand how he could let his vision of the amazing game that could have be become pollutedthere are five phases in spore  cell creature tribal city and space
they are not connected seamlessly  you just gain enough points in one a load screen pops up and youre in another
the choices you make really dont have an effect on your creature
originally you could put three mouths on your creature and it would actually use all three
you could attach six arms and it would use all six
now you just find the strongest body parts attach them to your creature and off you go
it doesnt matter if you have three mouths or one six arms or two
a creature with six slow legs will actually move slower than a creature with one fast legtribal is no better  you either destroy the other tribes or become friends with them but it has no effect on the upcoming city phase other than being either aggressive or friendly
i remember will wright saying you could design your tribal village and develop its culture  now you just slap down some buildings and buy some flutes or spears and thats the end of itcity is a little more difficult  well actually thats not true
all you have to do is buy a large number of units and then attack the enemy or if youre economic buy their cities
easy
no depthand then finally  space
unfortunately thats a let down as well
i was so excited when i finally made my little spaceship
then i realized that theres not really anything to do
oh sure you can fight the endless pirates or go searching around planets every time you get called to find sick creatures that threaten the ecosystem but believe me it gets old fast
it would be fun if i could go around terraforming worlds but it takes a very long boring time to get all of the tools
and please tell me why i have to go buy a single shot of atmospheric generator
why cant i buy it equip it on my ship and then have a cooldown time
essentially the game tries to extend its length by giving you tedious things to do but honestly spore just doesnt have any depth to it
its potential is unlimitedif maxis gets themselves together and puts out a patch and some amazing expansions ill definitely be purchasing them
but right now spore is just a simple short and unimaginative game
the sad thing is that the casual gamers it was dumbed down for will eat it up while us hardcore gamers are left wondering about what could have beenlet me say first off that the securom or the limited activations do not affect me one bit  i bought this game for myself and theres noone else around to play iti was a big spore fan
ive always loved maxis games andve been faithful for them behind the project too
ive waited for the game for over a year  to find thisthe game starts out good but as you play it youll find its somehow been dumbed down to a  year olds game
a kiddy game
the cell stage is the only part i found attractive
they skipped the sea creature stage made the ordinary creature stage incredibly linear you basically walk around while other creatures just stay at their nest the tribe and civ stage are horridly dumbed down excuses of rtss and the space stage is well kudos if youve played that far extremely boring and tediousi dont know who came to will wright with a gun to his head and took over this project nor did i know they were going to make this a game intended for  and under  but thats what it essentially ischeck out forum boards across the net spore is a major dissapointment for everyone that was so hyped up about it
they had a premise for an incredible game and lo and behold maxis of all producers has failedsorry to say it
i dont recomment this game
personally all i have to hope for now is starcraft ii or diablo  check those outlike a lot of people ive been tracking this game for a couple of years
the initial concept looked very cool and even knowing that games rarely live up to the initial concept i felt disappointed by the execution of this one
since the drm issue is pretty thoroughly covered elsewhere ill just talk about gameplay
this is very much an ea game
that is the graphics are pretty its kidfriendly if you dont build a porno creature and its runs pretty smoothly
if you love the micromanagement open storyline customizeittillithurts aspects of the sims franchise youll like this
if you want engaging storybased or strategy gameplay that handles the nits so you can enjoy the important stuff look elsewhere
the concept remains cool but i agree with others that its really dumbed down
the entire prespace game took me five hours or so the first time i played it on easy
the fifth time i played it took less than two hours to get to space on normal
there is absolutely no reason to play through the first levels once youve figured out the system  which for any experienced gamer will take maybe two or three games
sure you may want to build a new creature to try all the different bonus combinations but really how exciting is that
maybe im supposed to spend countless hours painting buildings designing ships or customizing my creaturess spots  but thanks ill pass
the evolution system is backwards imo and is just glorified sims character painting
instead of your creature evolving its body and personality based on the actions you take or the environment its in you basically build the body based on how you want to play and then act according to the bonuses you want at the end of each level
there is zero impact from the environment or other creatures or well anything that usually impacts evolution
this may be fine if your goal is to create say a flying carnivore with four arms who gets fighting bonuses  just go build it
keep in mind those four arms will behave no differently than two or five or one  its all for looks
but if youre more interested in tweaking a system  the environment the creatures diet etc
 and letting the creature evolve to adapt to the changes youre completely out of luck
the space level baffles me
ive played it four times and ive begun to believe its both more and less complex than i thought
more complex  theres a fair amount you can do  hunt for artifacts settle planets kill other races  and relatively little real explanation how any of it works
i find its too tedious managing a dozen or more independent planets with the one ship yet the game regularly requires you to be in several places at once
maybe this is the strategy part
less complex  once you get past the needless complexity of planet building its pretty much trade military or a combination
you have to love micromanagement  but if youre a sims player you probably doshort answer  if you want strategy or a simearth remember that game
type approach dont buy this
if youre looking for sims in space
 this is your game
ill probably keep it for days when i feel like micromanaging something but i expect ill get a total of  hours of play out of thisspore isnt bad but its not definitely not good and far from being what was promisedwhere did it go wrong
well each stage until you start reaching civilization is so brief so boring and uncreative in gameplay that theyve been designed to get through in an hour to save you aggrivation
im not exactly sure what they were thinking when they decided to include the first three stages in the game maybe a marketing strategy
maybe to hold up the games promise
unsure
but they dont work and i think they should have been left outthe creature creator promised to create creatures of your own design but are so dumbed down and restrictive that youll quickly be bored
it doesnt really matter what parts you put where each part has a value that raises a stat and including them is all that matters
im also more than a little disappointed by the parts available for your creature
you have to run around and collect them in the game to make them available but theres no real challenge in getting them and most are just stamps of the same parts with the same stats with a little different look to it and i mean littlewhich creature you choose is simple cold blooded killer
stop now if your not a meat eater your doing it wrong go start the game over  you can select your starting stage so it doesnt really matter anyways
you can be adventurous and say no im not going to be a meat eater but then your stupid cause all the other meat eaters just go feast on your little creations and an already boring game gets drawn out even furtheri cant say what the worst stage of the game is theyre all equally bad imomy kids had to have this game
they saved and pooled their money and installed it on the computer
that was great
it was working
they loved it
spore is after all a fun game
however then they downloaded the recommended patch
the game would no longer load
we spent over an hour chatting with tech support
spores tech supports final solution was to create a new administrative account on our pc just to play spore on and reinstall spore in that account and not install the patchif you have vista do not update the softwarei was expecting some level of strategy but virtually all aspects of the game are wholly simplified
a great disappointment once you realise the look of the creatures is the only amusing part of the game
im pretty sure a patch or addons would not make the game betteron the issue of drm others say it better than i can
if the game was already cracked before the game was released drm solely penalizes the folks who actually bought the gamepeople rating this game at one start because of the drm are silly
the drm is the least of the problem
the problem is the game itselfthe game looks great during about first  minutes of play
as soon as you get to creature stage and do the charmingkilling  times you realize that you were cheated
you can find flash web games that have more depth
this game is incredibly shallow stupid repetitive and just horribly boringi managed to get to the civilization state by literally forcing myself to play
i did that because i heard that it is more complex
after  minutes i civ stage i said thats it and hit that uninstall buttoni gave the game to a  years old game thinking that she would love it
she loved sims
suprise she said this game is too stupid for her
she said it is nothing just eat kill eat kill the same all the timeand gues what she was rightthe reason i gave two stars i thought the short video between creature and tribal stage was extremely funnythe first two stages of the game are great
in fact its the only unique part of this game
after that it turns into a boring rts game
all the hype and previews over this game were just lies
i feel like i was taken for a ride on this one
and to make matters worsethe camera angles and controls are awful in the rts stages
i even wasted money on a guide
dont buy this game if your thinking it will be something different
and now with the first patchthe sound is all screwed up
i uninstalled it and wish i could at least send it backhacking and slashing along with a bit of strategy was the name of the game in phantagrams last projects the somewhat popular xbox games kingdom under fire and kingdom under fire heroes
the teams latest game n ninetynine nights follows a similar structure and familiar gameplay but it lacks the heart and soul and anything outstanding that would put it above other similar gamesn tells the tales of several different characters none of whom have a very interesting or captivating story
from the blessed powerful imperial knights inphyy and aspharr to the brutal mercenary myifee youll encounter characters who have slightly stereotypical roles appearances attitudes and styles
i personally couldnt ever take the games story seriously simply because of the character names
i already mentioned aspharr but youll also meet dwikfarrio and dwingvatt as well as a giant frog king named phakk the third
what were they thinkingfor days i tried to give n a lot of credit for its gameplay but there isnt a lot that you wouldnt expect from other dynasty warriorsesque titles
youll run straight into hordes of enemies that range in the dozens to the hundreds
these crowds are fun to run into but once you start attacking n loses its massive charm
the combo attacks for each character are disgustingly simple to pull off and require very little skill in terms of timing
combos arent even necessary in the end because a player could quite easily mash the basic attack button and finish the game in a few hours
the only challenges i ever encountered were the boss characters who seemed overpowered and often untouchableonce you kill enough of the horde youll accumulate orbs that power up a special attack meter
each character has two levels of special attacks
the first attack which is activated after a red orb meter fills up is interactive youll mash buttons and generally watch things die
this series of attacks is simply a beefy combo that youd normally pull off
the second attack is charged up while killing things in the red attack
youll earn blue orbs that charge up for a super mega ultimate attack haha that kills just about every nonboss character onscreen
some of these attacks look cool especially dwikfarrios storm of doom but once youve killed ten thousand orcs youve killed em all rightn lacks checkpoints or ingame saves making each and every mission quite punishing
should you parish  minutes into a long mission youre forced to do it all over again
thats right youll kill the same crowd of orcs destroy the same catapults that are firing at the castle walls and fend off the same cheap boss characterthere dont seem to be any rewards for putting yourself through the pain of playing through this game other than unlocking more characters which simply forces you to play through more of the same  you stomached with a previous character
youll even revisit the same levels multiple times with different characters
excitingat least n looks alright
the staggering amount of enemies on the screen is impressive to say the least and the minimal slowdown is pretty nice as well
its too bad the character models get so repetitious because the heroes that youll use look amazing
inphyy the cover girl is my personal favorite character with her glittering golden wings and bloodred and shiny silver armor
its also too bad that everything in this game sounds awful
the voice acting is some of the worst ive ever heard and the lip sync is so ridiculously off that i began to believe phantagram didnt even make an attempt at realistic syncing
the sound effects get old within seconds of starting the game up and the soundtrack didnt seem to kick in enough when it should haven ninetynine nights may very well be the biggest disappointment that the xbox  has had to date
what should have been a gripping intense action game is nothing more than a game that could have been
move along play dead rising and enjoy your fall until the winter blockbusters releasei have to admit that this game is impressive from a technological standpoint
its truly amazing to see so many characters on screen at once with barely any slowdown
theres a level of mayhem to this game thats quite enjoyable but it gets old kind of fast
the gimmick of being able to throw yourself headfirst into hundreds of charging enemies and dispatching all of them in explosive battles is fun for a bit but its all kind of repetitive
the controls are responsive but make no mistake this game rewards button mashing like few others
any combination of buttons will give you fancy results and combos ranging in the thousands
graphics are pretty nice and the sound is well done also but the game seems to be lacking something due to its incredibly simple button mashing roots
the ai
in this game is pretty bad
its not uncommon to see enemy soldiers mingling about with your own soldiers who arent doing a thing to stop them
i also found that giving my squad orders seemed to be useless and ineffective due to the limited amount of choices i was given
theres some character customization limited to inventory management
the cut scenes are nice but the dubbed english is absolutely horrendous as expected
the story makes little sense and in the end what youre left with is a game that is a button masher of the highest order thats little more than eye candythis game was okay but not the best i have to say ultimate ninga and clash of ninga are the best naruto games the other naruto games were okay but this game was okaynaruto ultamite ninja is not all that
this particular game had a lot of bugs in it and is lacking the ever so cool rpg mode of its succsesorsin the end i feel sorry for you people with american pss because you will never be able to enjoy naruto to its fullest
i just recently recived my copy of naruto narutamite hero  of as it is called in the us ultamite ninja  and it blows this game out of the water with  characters and an awsome rpg modehaving played imperial glory a game about the same historical period i thought this game fell short
on the up side the building graphics are beautiful and it is an easy game to start playing and know what you are doing
on the downside the unit graphics are only fair because of the orientation of the camera
the game play also gets repetitive after a while
i quit playing after about a week
the game also lacks the features of previous cossacks titles
with no editor no naval units and a lack of skirmish maps this game seems to have been rather rushed
if you love the napoleonic genre then you may want to give it a go and maybe its flaws can be overlooked but if you want a classic rts with staying power and a long life like age of empires or rise of nations this aint itim a huge starcraft warcraft and cc fan so you know where im coming fromnot since the days of ultima have i seen so much hype for a game it makes me wonder what the magazines actually previewedthis game has a rediculously huge flaw  although the maps are indeed massive the game is completely unplayable if you are zoomed in to see the detail of the units
unless you have some sort of liquidcooled ubersystem your gameplay will consist of watching green red and blue dots battle each other
im not kidding
i have  monitors which the game thankfully supports
one monitor is dedicated for displaying a world map while the other is where the action takes placeif you read the same articles i read you are probably expecting some amazing ai in the singleperson game
dont bet on it
like just about every other rts game on the planet your enemy does a rush attack within about  minutes
if you build up massive defenses right away you will stave off every attack
then simply build the top tier units over the next hour and rush till you winas for the three singleplayer scenarios these are woefully disappointing
you see each of the three races have the same sort of techtree so if youve played one race youve played all three
the problem is that each of the campaigns treat you as if youve never played the game before
so even if you work your way to the third campaign your first mission consists of learning how to gather resources and build units
what an insult to the customer
why not assume the campaigns will be played in order and make them successively harder
for the first half of each of the campaigns the more powerful units are unavailable
in fact you dont even get to build the toughest units until the very last mission of each campaignin my opinion the most groundbreaking game in recent history has been dawn of war
the races in that game are very different
in some cases the tech trees are downright uniquewhat a letdown this game wasi was excited to see a new game based on the now defunked cavedog entertainments total annihilation model
i rushed out and paid full price huge mistakepros graphics and dynamic zoomcons no difference in units between factions so no replay valueview is too narrow forcing you to zoom out  watch an icon showheavily skewed toward the enemy forcing excessive unit creationmaps are boring and lack any real strategic designface it this game is about building exhausting quantities of units and trying to overwhelm by sheer numbersanyone that played ta knows what a tank rush is well this game is nothing but a big tank rush no strategy beyond thatthe whole game is based on massive unit creation
you have two choices build a huge defense so you can build mass quantities of units or squander one series of units after another in an endless stream of attacks hoping to make a crack in the level
after  levels i am getting quite sick of queing up about  units and waiting for them to build all the while getting hammered by the seemingly endless ability of the enemy to build with abandonthe maps are wide open spaces with no imagination in terrain objectives or advantages
no sneak attacks no vantage points on and onthe view is so narrow that you never get to see the action you will spend the entire game zoomed out controlling groups of icons instead of witnessing the carnage
booooooringthere is no difference in unit type from one faction to another so no need to play the other races as they are essentially the same only different graphicshere is the one and only strategy build so many units that you overwhelm the enemy
period
any other method fails
stealth forget it
smarts forget it creativity forget it
varied gameplay no chancewhat a waste of time
i keep playing hoping it will get better but i am thinking of reloading my now  year old version of total annihilation which is far better than this game and the graphics arent half bad eithersave your money find a copy of the original ta from cavedog along with core contingencytotal annihilation fans this is not a new and improved version of ta
i tried single player skirmish
the zoom viewing is pretty neat but the maps are boring and their terrain including graphics is mediocre
the screen movement is jerky and the maps blur while you move across
the mini map is not as good as the ta
one
the assignment lines showing unit routes are awkward and confusing
i was disappointed
it was a waste of money
no doubt there will be a lot of used ones for saledespite the hype about this games scale the battles are surprisingly tiny despie the huge maps
furthermore units are so small that they often are barely noticeble unless you zoom all the way in meaning battles will often look rather silly like tiny specs of animated color shooting at one anotheralthough the maps are huge and i mean huge the space given within the maps is uneccassery at best
the armies often comrpise no more than  units per side and given the units tiny size this does not require a great deal of space
so what is all the space for
frankly i have no ideathe controls in this game are clunky especially when playing online when you cant pause
while yes it is possible ot give a group of units very complex orders via the shift key system in place these orders take a bit of time to issue even when you are very eperinced with the system meaning online play which in rts game is fast paced by nature becomes rather difficult to pull off
this of course is a not a problem when playing against the ai given you can pauseon the whole this game had alot of potential the huge maps could have been used for something but given the tiny units and the tiny number of units this game was alot of hype with no deliveryaside from huge maps this game offers very littlei wish to note at the outset of this review that thq ignored numerous requests for information on the game as well as media information which i thought was necessary to answer some of questions and concerns i had about the game
i mention this as usually a company is more than happy to answer questions that are posed by members of then media which might be an indicator that support for the game may be lacking so potential buyers may want to bear this in mindrts guru chris taylor has returned which the megahyped supreme commander which is said to take rts games to a new level
the game offers much potential as players can compete as one of three races on distant battlefields each with their own unique weapons and technologiesas i played the game i was at first impressed with the abilities to reclaim fallen units for mass necessary to create new units and that many of the units could be upgraded as a players technology level increasedthe game also offers a nice array of land sea and air units that allow players to develop attack and defense postures that suit their styles
for example if you prefer to pound them on the ground to open a whole in the enemys defense line for your air units then you may do sosadly once you get past the initial eye candy numerous issues in the game arise
one thing is the amazingly poor unit ai
that happens at a frustrating level
i commanded a squadron of bombers to stay put at a locale while i built up my forces only to see them and other units time and time again rush off into battle on their ownanother issue for me was the fact that the game cut scenes were complete with a voice track but when you are in game and getting commands from your superiors the commands come in via text message
it is  folks when i am in the middle of a battle i do not want to take the time to have to read text when voice conversations should have been includeddespite my early frustrations i continued on in the game and soon discovered another issue with the game
one mission required me to relocate units to a base and then evacuate them
the problem is that it never said what units it needed so i moved all of them to the new base and was constantly frustrated by a counter that listed  sets of numbers but required me to move units over one style at a time to learn exactly what they expected me to moveundaunted i decided to try the multiplayer portion of the game and found that even though i had the latest update patch the game still wanted to patch and posted numerous errors when trying to update to allow access to the online network for the game
i finally solved this by locating a folder in the game directory and patching manuallyonce in multiplay the game was so slow that is was practically unplayable with four human players all boasting high end systems and high speed connections
case in point a bomber took  minutes to go from one side of the map to anotheranother bug noted in the game was that at times when i attempted to start the game from the icon on my taskbar the system would reboot
as a person who worked in tech support for years in the early days of my writing career i of course know the need for updated drivers and a lack of other programs running and i can assure you that none of those reasons were behind the system rebooting
i had to take to opening and closing my dvd drive to get the game menu up to playgraphically the game has some nice features and the explosions in the game are very well rendered and make up for the average to poor sound of the game and the poor voice worki had very high hopes for supreme commander based on the hype and early reviews
sadly the game is buggy and dull and does not rate more to me than a good idea gone horribly wrongmy advice ignores the hype skip this one and wait for command and conquer  stars out of gareth von kallenbachi didnt know this game was a sequel to total annihilation one of my favorite games so when i got it and noticed the similarities i was excited
the game looks great and the battles and maps are hugethe bad side is game balance and strategy are lacking
build a bunch of stuff and attack
over and over
air power is way too powerful so many games are a rush to see who can get air defenses and bombers up and running firstthere doesnt seem to be much replay value
the races are very similar and there arent many opportunities to try out different tactics and strategies to win
build build build
attackif there was ever an example of an overhyped game supreme commander takes the cake with bioshock a close secondi get suspicious when a game receives so many raving reviews from gaming magazines and it sites yet people who bought it cannot get rid of it quick enough look how many misinformed and disillusioned customers are selling their used copies for a pittancesupcom sports huge maps  ofundifferentiated landscape
low mountains hills and plains are just colored patches as in no way do they affect the movements of the units
so what is the use of a big map in a strategy game if the landscape plays no role in the gameplayi have a fairly good pc system mhz p gb ram mb gt gxcard on an asus p mb and as long as the number of units were below a couple of hundred i experienced no syncopated sound stuttering or freezing
as the game progressed though and the number of units increased all of the above made their gradual appearance
and the quality of the graphics in no way can it justify such system drainagezooming in is an empty treat sure one can zoom in almost as much as with cc and they did pay attention in the detailed design of the units and explosions
however with such huge maps no actual maneuvering is possible unless one zooms out enough to have an overview of the battlefield  and this only happens when instead of units the only thing visible are their infotags
this is what we are left moving around rectangular pixelated infotagsbalanced
are you kidding
pokemon is more balanced than supcom
hell good old rockpaperscissors is more balanced than supcomfrustrating
try ordering a group of tanks to attack an enemy unit about to destroy a structure of yours they ll take their sweet time about it
i guess they are in a union and no one can do anything about iti cannot even begin to imagine what they packaged into the gb
it takes up on the hd
the three campaigns differ in name only
replayability
only by someone else
if bored to death
and then only for less than an hourmy advice passinstead replay lotrbattle for middle earth or even emperor battle for dune
they are much better gamesi was a great fan of total annihilation
im a fan of the rts genre in general
i played supcom online for a couple months but ultimately i have to confront the factthis game stinks
i desperately tried to enjoy it but i cant honestly suggest it to other people
i played for as long as i did hoping it would improve with patches and while they fixed a lot of technical problems the gameplay problems still persistthe game engine is fantastic
it looks awesome
the battles are great
the units look fabulous and there are some fun and unique takes on some of the high tech units the ones always featured in screenshotsthe problem is the gameplay is just horrid both for online and offline playfirst of all you should have dual core to play this game
they have done a lot of performance improvements since the games release but if you want big games on the big maps you need dual core
consequently trying to do v games online is a nightmare as no manner how much you stress that everyone in the room needs dual core and they all say they do invariably one player will not have it and the gameplay will bog down to intolerable levels
online multiplayer gaming can frequently become unplayable unless you just stick to v on smallish mapsthe game has vista problems or vista has problems with this game
it tends to crash on vista during big games
so dont use vista if you can avoid it
this is just another way big v matches end up failing  if someone doesnt bog the game down with their slow computer someone will crash out because theyre using vistathe economy is unique and horrible
the economic model in the game is similar to total annihilation but with a couple of differences map control quickly becomes almost completely meaningless and base defenses are vastly improved over what they were in ta
ta was largely a war of attrition against your enemy  he builds  fusion plants you kill   he builds  more you kill  more
due to the improved defenses of supcom that doesnt happen
by the time you can break through your opponents defenses to destroy his fusion plant you might as well skip the fusion plant and blow up his commander instead ending the battleso typical long games degenerate into both sides hunkering behind their defenses until one side can launch a single fast devastating attack that breaches the defenses and immediately ends the game
the long continuous back and forth battles of ta are gone i am sad to sayon smaller maps you wont get to that point and you can have some good gameplay but then youre not playing the game that was sold to you on the box and in the screenshots
youre doing low tech rushes on small maps and youre not going to reach the cool units proudly displayed to you in the magazine reviewsall of this leads to a shrinking community too
i made it as high as top  for my v ranking and it got to the point where i just couldnt find a ranked game to join
i sit there for literally  minutes searching for game and theres no match because nobody near my rating is playing ranked games anymore
they all quit or theyre all playing nonranked games because ranked games on small maps honestly arent that fun and dont represent the gameplay sold on the box
there are top players who have posted screenshots of themselves with  hour timers or more waiting for a matchthis review makes me sad because i loved ta and i wanted to love supcom but its just not happening and i dont think youre going to see any further sweeping changes to this game that will ever bring ranked gameplay back into popularity
you can find people playing custom playermade modifications and maybe you can get some enjoyment out of that but regular ranked gameplay is doa and thats too badmaybe the next game forged alliance will fix some of the problems but i probably wont bother at this point
between the way this game released and the companys reaction to gameplay suggestions on their official forums bans i dont see myself trying another gpg product until they can prove theyve really turned things aroundthis game had the potential to be great  solid financial backing noted designers great graphics and an impressive story idea
so what happened
the game we get is buggy uninspired repetitive and contains poor multiplayer
yes it looks pretty and has multimonitor support  but who cares
the gameplay is weak and that is why people buy rts real time strategy gamesgeneral and single player complaints single player campaigns too short
there are roughly six missions for each of the three factions and the first few for each faction are training missions single player factions repetitive
the missions for each of the three factions are mirrorimages of eachother with only slight modification
ex the map for mission  of the cybran campaign is the same as the map for mission  of the uef campaign
the goals are slightly different but for the most part only slightly units are too similar
the units for each of the three factions are almost identicle though there are slight modifications the tech  tank for aeon may hover while the same techtank for the others does not linear campaigns
there is no altering the fate of the game besides the initial choice of faction
if one general wants you to cleanse a civilian settlement and another does not youll have to do it if the computer says that is your objective  otherwise the game does not continue unit limits include too many structures
at this time building certain structures including cement barricades added to your total  of units  a number that has a ceiling
which would you rather have a tank that can kill the enemy or a single immobile concrete barricade that youd need ten of to be useful
the limits simply do not make sense the ai is weak
dont expect impressive techniques and strategiesmultiplayer complaints multiplayer games were extremely buggy at the time of this writing
there were known bugs that crashed  player games build bugs etc supreme commander was simply not ready for multiplayer on release gpgnet gas powered games multiplayer connection network for supreme commander is poorly designed
example it will load the supreme commander game taking time and comp resources when entering a mission room  instead of just using the chat client
considering many missions fail to launch parameters change constantly since there is no way to not post a mission before setting them this is simply annoying lack of valid opponents
most players do not have computers that can support largescale battles with multiple opponents
prepare for the game to desync or for people to crash out on a regular basis teching up is still not perfected
rushers tend to beat techers  times out of  at the time of this writing
techers have to use a standard playbook in order to get anywhere experimental unit balance is lacking
the experimental units for certain factions are far superior to othersgeneral praise the ending and movies for each faction are different and lends to overall enjoyment multimonitor support is interesting if you use two monitors the graphics are impressive for a rts gamefinal summary there are better rts games on the market  save your moneythe title says it all if you have never played a good rts game then maybe you will like this game but for anyone who has played a game like starcraft then you know how bad this game sucks
it was fun for like  hours or so but i found it to be not very interesting at all
i only made it through like  levels or so before i had to call it quits
can you say boring
play world in conflict instead
maybe this is one of those games that is meant to be played multiplayer only as it seems that would be quite enjoyable but as for the singleplayer experience two thumbs downit is not the worst game i have played this year but far from the best
as we age we see new movies or books or games that have been done before
sometimes the new movie or game is acutally better than the original
usually though it is an average redo with new technology to make it the best ever
if you never played some of the older games like diablo than this is well worth buying
otherwise you may be bored
sort of like watching another slasher flick you know when she is going to diei love playing diablo and diablo ii but i want some new content and new maps which led me to buy titan questtitan quest is being promoted as diablo iii and it does share some features with diablo but it doesnt have the same feel to it
it feels more like sacred with d graphics
on the plus side its very easy to play if you like diablo darkstone and sacred youll enjoy it most functions work with a click of the mouse and you can jump in and start playing right away with no learning curve
its a simple minded hack and slash romp enter an area kill anything that moves pick up stuff reequip your character sell junk in town get your completed quest bonus level up and proceed to the next area
the graphics are gorgeous its a very pretty game
the skill system is excellent you get to choose two uber skill trees to develop and you can then pick and choose branches to follow
i particularly like the critters you can summon
the core dweller is like a cross between the incredible hulk and the human torch awesomethere are a bunch of negatives though
big negative is the extreme system requirements you cant play this game on a mb pci video card and you probably wont be able to run it on an integrated video chip either
i had to upgrade to a mb fx pci card in order to play it on low settingsmy system ran oblivion and half life without a problem but this game is glitchie freezes and stutters a lot even with the patch installedthe game is very linear you need to explore the entire map and go into every nook and cranny if you want to complete all of the minor questsreplay value is zero on starting a new charcter i got exactly the same item drops and exactly the same maps as on the first run throughyou cant go very far off the path and whichever path you follow always leads you to the next town in line
the voice acting is awful annoying and repetitive rather than feeling like im in greece or egypt it sounds like im in a deli on the lower east side of nyc
for the orient area it sounds like they got the waiter at the local chinese restaurant to do the voices in pidgin englishthe critters group in clusters around bone piles and chests the loot comes shooting out at you
you cant go wrong if you follow one edge of the map around and attack the largest cluster of critters in sight
the backpack is too small but you get some small extra sacks eventually which increase carrying capacity a little
no stash
interesting upgrade stuff but very awkward to use and annoying
usually by the time you accumulate all three or five pieces of the upgrade relic youve found a better item to use thats not upgradeable so youve ended up carrying around a bunch of useless junkthe caves and temples are mostly small rooms and mazes
the quest system is annoying theres no sense of doing something for a reason you click on an npc with a yellow exclamation point over his head he rambles on endlesslyto the point that you tune him out youll need to click on your quest tab for a summary of what he wants you to do most quests seem to involve an item the npc lost while he was running away from the beasties but you look like a hardy fellow who can recover it for himthen walk up the path find the cave or temple kill a bunch of critters pick up the quest item and return it to the npc for the quest bonus then hell ramble on some more and give you another taskrepeat againanother negative is the opening video theres no way to turn it off you have to watch the whole thing every time you start the gameall in all its a mixed bag but if you want a game that plays like diablo but doesnt look like diablo there arent a lot of choices availablewhen i first held the ds in my hands it reminded why nintendo is a lost cause
good for them that they are selling like hotcakes but you get what you pay for
after seeing whats now available on the psp i just cannot fathom how people can still stomach super mario xcviii when games like super ghost n goblins the sega museum grand theft auto etc
are available for the psp
now with the option of being able to access your ps with a psp expect more psp sales
if you like simple games and cannot afford something better go for a ds
if youre a hardcore gamer you cannot go wrong with a psp especially since its finally getting aaa gamesi have owned both versions of the nintendo ds system and found that i like the ds lite much less than the older ds to the point of actually going back and exchanging it for an older model
the ds lite is just as much fun and the screens are brighter but i am unhappy with almost all of the changesthe old ds wasnt anywhere near as pretty as the ds lite but it was much sturdier
i am very gentle with my handhelds and the outside of my ds lite had several scratches after a little over a week it also had several pixels die on the top screen within the first few days of ownership a problem i have not had with the older ds
overall the new ds just doesnt feel sturdy and i feel a little like i might break it if im not careful
the original ds was a system that could take some punishment a fact that you might want to consider if buying one for a younger childwhile i like the thicker stylus i have found that the touch screen on the ds lite seems a lot less sensitive than the one on the old ds
i used to be able to use my finger for games where i would only need to touch the screen on occasion but my ds lite would not respond to anything but the stylus or very hard and repeated finger taps
when i placed the same brand of screen protector i used on my original ds for years on the ds lite the touch screen became completely unresponsivethe ds lite comes with a nice piece to stick in the gba game slot when there is no game in it some people might not be aware that gba games do not fit all the way into the ds lite like they do into the original ds
gameboy advance packs stick out about one centimeter something that i find very annoying as i liked to leave a gba game inside my ds and my ds lite would not fit into a case if i did so i had to take the game out and replace the filler piece when i wanted to put the system awaythe ds lite is considerably smaller and much thinner than the original and if you are an adult with larger hands this isnt necessarily a good thing
the buttons are also smaller and i have found them harder to work because of this especially with some of the new button placements
i find the start and select buttons harder to use now especially since they are so tiny
the dpad doesnt seem as responsive
i also miss the wrist strap that the ds used to come with and liked to carry it that way
the ds lite doesnt have oneoverall i think that which model of the ds to buy or whether to replace your older ds with a ds lite is a matter of personal preference
the ds lites big selling point are its brighter screens
they are noticeably brighter but i never had a problem seeing anything on my original ds and i dont notice that much of a difference except on the highest brightness settings
i am very happy with the longer battery life and the quicker charge time with the ds lite but have found that for me its not worth putting up with the other changesweve gone through two of these within  years same problem sholder buttons not working
anyway we were going to return this and get a new one it was then i realized that the metllic was on clearance and no other ds lite was this leads me to believe that all ds metallics are defective
i had a onyx ds lite and it held up for  years of beatings
the ds metallic cant stand  yearthis item worked but is not the best quality and i do not believe it is original
would not buy againi admit i havent played a lot of survival horror
i rented this game because i thought it would be a good intro to the genre without the need to worry about twitch shooting and ammo counts
plus the story sounded interestingthings didnt turn out that way
the game is sloooowwww
action
what action
you spend your time running around through the same areas looking for items
sometimes you end up in combat
mostly you run aroundi use the word run loosely since jennifer does not seem capable of fast movement
imagine running with your legs tied together  thats her speed
to add insult to injury if you make her move too much she bends over and pants once you stop heron the other hand graphics and audio are very well donethis game is slow moving no run ability
 there is no onscreen life meter wtf
 no ability to target enemies imprecise controls terrible combat system yet extremely well done strange  bizarre cutscenes with beautiful graphics
i can understand people loving the trailer for this game the cutscenes really are some of the best graphics ive seen in the ps but this is a game not a movie
the control  combat sections random guys each level and boss battles are why this is so bad and many of the combat parts you cannot avoidthis is the equivalent of a dumb blonde videogame  it looks really nice but when you interact with it you realize it is borderline retardedthe good creepy atmosphere disturbing scenes and imagesthe bad story makes zero sense horrible unresponsive and cumbersome combat constant backtracking no sense of direction inventory is always getting cluttered lame hidden items and extrasthis is a very hard game to review
i wanted to like this game so bad and it had so much potential
the beginning cut scene is disturbing and the excellent and eerie soundtrack playing out is fantastic
it starts out like a silent hill game with the gritty film grain and the dark atmosphere
i honestly cant tell you what the story is about because it is never explained at all even at the very end i didnt know who the bad guy was why i was doing all this and who was what
i can tell you that you get dumped off at an orphanage via bus with your little brother joshua
you walk up to the creepy orphanage and you immediately know somethings not right
kids with paper bags over their heads are beating something bloody in a canvas sack
you sneak around to the back and after a few cut scenes you realize youre running errands for this creepy child occult but the purpose is never explainedonce you start playing for a while you will notice many of this games flaws
theres no map and no sense of directions
you will got lost and not know where the hell to go through the whole game
most of the game you are wandering from room to room looking for items for your dog brown to find
he will sniff these items out and find the next item for you and you just follow him
if it wasnt for this the entire game would be broken exploration wise
like silent hill there are many secrets in the game but you wont care about these
the airship that you wander around in is so big and confusing
each room and hallway looks the same and you cant tell where you are ever going even if you memorize it
some parts become familiar because you go through them over  times during the game
i also didnt even know why i was on an airship
nothing made a lick of sense through the whole gamelets start with combat it sucks big time
holding r will put you in ready mode and x swings
this would be great if you moved more than a centimeter so you can go in for a kill
enemies will knock you down and you will go through a long and grueling recovery animation only to get knocked over again
there are very few healing items around unless you have brown sniff out items like ribbons and socks to bring to the aristocrat club to be exchanged for healing items
whats the aristocrat club
i have no idea but its just there
there are  boss fights in the entire game and they are annoying because the combat is slow sluggish and cumbersome in this game
i cant express it enough
if thats not bad enough running around trying to find all these damn items will give you a headache
after you find them you just drop them because they are no longer needed
your inventory is constantly cluttered up with useless crap that you just end up dropping
why have this mechanic
the game itself is very short running about  hours if you follow a walkthrough step by step
if not you probably wont even finish this game
it felt generally tolerable to me because i used a walkthrough through the whole thing but if you dont i doubt you could even finish the game
i also have to comment on the controversy surrounding the game theres nothing all that bad in here
there were claims of the girls being molested in cut scenes but the worst i saw was an old guy rubbing a girls head and her arms a lot
there are no rape scenes nothing even sexually provocative
the game is very bloody and down right sick and twisted but nothing on the other spectrumapart from that the game had a lot of potential
the atmosphere is there and its pretty scary at times and very disturbing i just wish i knew what the hell was going on
the story is completely convoluted and doesnt go anywhere you cant make a single bit of sense of it
the combat is atrocious and the lack of direction and the constant backtracking will make  of players quit early on
i really wanted to love this game but as i got through each hour the score kept dropping in the my head and the reasons why were piling up
if you are really curious i would pick it up as a low bargain bin price but nothing more
if a fried has a copy borrow it because it is a strange experience and worth talking about with friendsthis goes into my top  of disappointing games
all hype and no substance
yes there are pretty graphics but they are not the prettiest ive ever seen in a racing game
but besides that there is nothing
the car lineup is pitiful and the fun factor i dont mean to start a war about which console is better bc they both ps and xbox  have their strengths and weaknessesbut one day when i was bored and at best buy i decided to pick up project gotham racing   heck i hadnt even realized it came out bc there was little to no fan fare
but having played it it is so much more fun than gt
if you want to argue that gt is not meant to be fun but is a realistic simulator i am emphatic in the fact that the two do not have to be mutually exclusive and pgr proves it
as a simulator it is far far better than gteach car has such a different feel and sound
gt is really weak in the sound areathere is little variation between each engine
and pgr manages to be a fun game
like i said im not here to start a war but gt is so overhyped and was a major disappointment
for a game that was featured on  minutes i expect more
there arent many games that i actually would give to someone for free but this is one of themgraphic is so so
game play is so so too
game play gives you sense of dejavu on a lot of races
no progression to next class unless you finished all event which is ok but there is always a special mission that block you from complete the event
for example the famous b that block player progression into next class is simply ridiculous
you simply dont throw this at the beginningearly of the game to block peopleeverything the others say about this game is accurate
it is a driving simulator your car never gets scratched the ai in the game is lacking etc
so if you want a driving simulator buy this game because it is fun to compare the cars on the race tracks
there is at least one race that seems impossible and this impossible requirement brings the fun level down
i dont mind trying  times to win a race which requires me to really examine every turn but forcing me to drive that suzuki cappuccino in a race against better cars starting from the th position  gimme a break
challenging i dont mind
next to impossible is just too disappointing to be funright up front ill point out the three most obvious things about gt prologue
it looks gorgeous
the ai is abominable
there is still no car damageto use a lovely english expression  its all mouth and no trousers
look past the hd graphics and hype and youll find gran turismo  lurking herethe gran turismo games are known for their accurate car handling and fantastic graphics and gt prologue is no exception
the problem is that it is all absolutely ruined by the other driver ai
previous gran turismo titles have never exactly shone when it comes to the ai but in gt its simply nonexistent
its not that the ai is dumb its just not there
the other cars all drive on rails irrespective of where you are
for example on the high speed ring circuit  theres a challenge to get from the back of the pack to the front in a single lap
in the car they give you it is  impossible to come any higher than rd and thats a stretch
the drivingonrails is so accurate and predictable that you can actually predict exactly where every car will be at any given point
youll come up behind the ford focus at the end of the second turn and dont even think about passing him on the outside because he will always jink to the left for no reason as he goes across the bridge
if youre in the way then tough
the game will just force you off the track
at the next corner the mazda  will always follow the identical line inside the corner again irrespective of whether youre therethe same is true in the other types of race
within minutes of playing this game you will find yourself making a tidy corner only to have a much faster car come right up behind you and ram you off the track because youre in the way of its preprogrammed line
to see how truly awful it is start a race at the back and watch the  cars in front of you
theyll all cut the same corner in the same way every lap all with the identical puff of dirt as they do itit is simply abominablethe problem is that this issue was solved long ago by the likes of  well  just about every other racing franchise out there
its compounded by the fact that there is still no car damage or dirt in gt
you can stuff any car into a concrete armco at mph and it will simply bounce off without so much as a scratch
to think that polyphony could put out a game with no car damage and ruinous ai on a nextgen console in  just boggles the mind given how accomplished the competition is think project gotham racingso what about the eyecandy aspect
well  it runs at p full hd and it looks absolutely spectacular
the textures are crisp and dont blur out at highly obtuse angles like they would on an xbox
the car models are beautiful as are the various effects like the realtime reflections and the colourflip paint jobs
there is some aliasing on highcontrast areas but detail popup is minimal
there are very noticable levelofdetail swaps on some of the cars where they swap from a low detail to a high detail version
its most noticable on the daytona circuit where youll occasionally see the shading on the back of a car pop noticably as the model swaps to its higher resolution version
in fact the eyecandy aspect is only marred slightly be the fact that the game clearly doesnt run at  frames per second
well  it does on sparsely populated tracks but in the thick of the action on some circuits youll see noticable slowdown which you just shouldnt have on a console as powerful as a pswhat other things to know about
well the online aspect of the game has a lot of promise but its buggy at best
if your ps isnt set up pefectly on a broadband network nat type  it just wont connect to the servers
if youre lucky enough to have a good setup then even when it does connect the racing is a bit dodgy
its obvious that the sample rate for your system communicating with all the others is fairly slow as youll often see your opponents cars jump across the circuit from one side to the other or suddenly appear to brake or accelerate at light speed as the servers catch upwhen you come to use the game for the first time be prepared for a long wait
it seems to copy the entire bluray disc on to the internal hard drive which takes a good  minutes then as soon as you connect it will download a huge update which will take  to  minutes to download and another  minutes to install
so outofthebox to first race is about  minutes
that seems a bit odd to me  i was entirely expecting the game to run off the disc like many of the other ps titlesso gt prologue  its great eyecandy sure
but the two biggest most longstanding problems with the gt franchise are still present
awful ai and no car damage
the press previews and talk from polyphony indicate that the full game will have car damage but historically theyve never been known to change their underlying game engines between the prologue and the full versions of gt
they have always claimed that theyve fixed the ai with each successive version of the game but honestly  gt prologue has taken a massive step backwards
they say its better than ever but its actually worse than ever
so when they say there will be car damage in the full game i say cry wolf im afraidits an ominous omen for gt later this year
sure itll have more cars and more tracks
but chances are it will have the same problems the gt franchise has always had and thats simply not good enough
couple that with the questionable frame rate and online problems and that could be disastrousi dearly love the gt  franchise  ive had every one of them and ive been hoping and praying that they would one day fix the ai problems and the lack of car damage
if theyve not done it on the ps then its just never going to happen and that is a sad indictment of polyphonys marketing strategy
ive played this game a lot desperately wanting to like it but i always put the controller down and am left with an empty feeling
its just not excitingthis game was given to me as a present
i love most games and would love to receive them as presents however as you can see in the title it says prologue which means it is not the full game
it is still a pretty decent game but seeing as the full game came out spend the extra dollar or two and buy the actual game or save your money and buy a different game such as need for speed
this game was meant to show off the new game before it came out
well the new game came out a while ago rendering this game rather obsoleteoccasional screen tearing due to slow frame rate
game doesnt run smoothly as it should
great picture otherwise
this game had potential but fell short star average and a low price gold box deal usually equal a done deal for me
i bought this game the last time they had it on sale and i feel like i was ripped offthe name made me a bit weary with prologue but who really releases demos at full game price
i bought it thinking it would be a new fun installment in the series with all of the other unlockable content and adjustability but it is notyou cant switch from first person modeyou do not have even half the cars availablethere are only a few tracksthe medal ceremony music is atrocious and you cannot skip itthe load times between garage dealership and events are annoyingdont buy it unless you are a collector and need this ridiculous fraction of a gamefirst the cut scenes are way too long and frequent
second is the installation is fragile
i have had to reinstall  times first resetting my ps to defaults or game would freeze
the control system is terrible
way too complicated
i  dont like sneak games
this one seems to be all stealth and no shoot
at least that is what the game tells you
i gave up after a half hour due to about  minutes of the half hour being cut scenesfirst off i have to say im really surprised that this game got the solid reviews that it received
it ranks last or next to last out folklore is poor of the  ps games i have played
heres whythe game really has very little game to play most of the game is comprised of cutscenes
the gameplay itself is easy and very repetitive
the bosses are the worst i have ever encountered
other than the praying mantis they are just time consuming endeavers and very boring
the fact that you can purchase additional weapons etc
in the middle of a battle is stupid beyond belief
the ending battle is the worst possibly in video game historythe story is not very good either
its long overly dramatic and corny
the potty humour is embarrasingthe graphics are pretty good but no better than other solid games
the load times are terrible and poorly placed
replay value not muchto summarize i really dont get it i had fairly high expectations of this game because from my experience reviews are usually fairly accurate
want a really good game that is fairly recent try demons soulsaddtion to previous reviewwould like to add to my original review due to playing game again and skipping the bad cutscenes
my review is that the game is still not very good
the stealth part of the game is good however the bosses while not hard or just very boring time consuming endeavers
if you play this game youll see what i mean
act  has very touchy controls when you fight vamp this is a really ridiculous battlewhen your done with vamp you have to endure the most embarassing cutscene in the history of games watching octogon cry is incredibly bad
i do not get the reviews of this game  i gave it a  but that is being generousact  is still terribleto give you an idea of my gaming preferences i really like the zelda games
this is the first metal gear solid game i have played and will be the last
if your one of the mgs followers youll probably love the gameyou spend about  of your time watching cinematic scenes between gameplay
the general storyline of the game is good but the gameplay isnt really that interesting and the cenamatics are somewhat hoaky
i only have time to play games about an hour or two at a time and the long cinematics make that impossiblei expected a lot from mgs after all the hosannahs and although the opening hours did not disappoint i hadnt fully reckoned with the determination of the games designers to beat me into the groundthe story
well if you like bmovie trash stirred with meandering ruminations on the human condition endless pregnant pauses and codphilosophy then say hello to your new favourite game
if however like me you prefer your trash served neat then mgs is what can only be described as an endurance test from which you may extract only minimal pleasures and probably not the ones the designers had intendedthe gameplay is detailed the graphics are impressive  but i felt like i was in second gear the whole time
compared to splinter cell this is like stealth for accountantsif you are looking for a great stealth game this is not it
try splinter cell conviction which is really a great time and very replayable but youll need an xbox the designers who made this game are quite obviously obsessive micromanagers not pleasuregivers  and they categorically need a ruthless editori will never get those hours of my life back
neverpreface i am a huge fan of the original mgs and have played through it multiple times
it is easily the best game in the series
mgs   had great gameplay but the cutscenes were very bloated
mgs continues this trend in a very bad waymgs was a big letdown for me
there are a few areas towards the beginning that allow for some creative new mgs type gameplay but the areas get smaller and smaller as the game progressessimilarly the story is on a downward spiral from the beginning
overblown cutscenes are back with a vengeance with the most drawnout melodramatic dialogue in the series
however mr kojima takes the crapscenes to a new level of suck by adding lots of awkward fan service dialogue between characters
also the final confrontation between snake and ocelotliquid is a pathetic mess that falls flat as both a movie and a game
go back and replay the end of mgs for a refresher course on how to successfully combine gameplay and cutscenes for an awesome endingid like to give this  stars but i cant deny some of the innovative gameplay the deserves some praise
penny arcade was right if you want to enjoy this game at all skip every cutscenebought this game based on the  star reviews and and somehow praise in the press and am mystified as to what all the fuss is abouti find snake as a character almost unbearingly annoying to havei mean you almost want him to just go awaythe cutscenes are dreadfull and god looooong and the controls are just weirdswitching weapons on the main menu loleither its a movie or its a video gameit does neither very well at allin that sense the game is a disasterdevoted about  hours to this game and was pressing on in disbief at just how boredunimpressed and at times horrible the game wasvide games are supposed to be funthis isntresistance the fal of man has a story that blows this one away too and that is short brief and to the pointis snake so interesting
now i am stuck with this game to gather dust or sell for a few dollars at bestthis game may have been ground breaking in   in  however its a complete and utter bore
im not quite sure why so many people seem to love itas others have adequately stated this isnt really a game
its a series movies occasionally interrupted by three minuntes of runandcover
and geez some of those cut scenes are obnoxiously long
were talking  minutes long
sure you can skip them but  times out of  that only leads you to another cut scene
it seems the guys who made this game want to be movie directors
if thats the case then go make moviesalso theres a lot of juvenile humor  fart jokes and other scattalogical humor
and hey lets futher pander to the teenage demographic buy selling copies of playboy at the ingame gun shop
that makes sensethe only good thing i can say about this game is that it graphically holds up pretty well
for its age it looks a lot better than some games released in the last year
but thats about itthe entire experience smacks of selfindulgence  look at our fancy cut scenes
look at our fancy ability to change camera angles during cut scenes
were so cinematic
look how awesome we are
honestly i dont care how awesome you think your cut scenes are if your game in boring to playin short if you want a fun stealth game pick up either of the batman games or deus ex human revolution
those are incredibly fun stealth games that you know have a point
and by point i mean they let you actually play the game game makers abandoned the online after jumping through  places to register to play the game still iswas unable to play online
now the system is offline for all users
controls are terrible nothing like the original games
level design is poor
cameras are not for our advantageby far the worse game in the series
looking forward to the next game which was sold by a competitive game makergraphics are weak
gameplay is anciently stiff
story is lame unless you like dumb characters made up to try and support lame gameplaythats how i feel about this game after getting and playing batman assasins creed and unchartered ive been a fan of the series all along you can view some of my previous reviews so keep in mind this review is someone who has been a fan of the series all along
i have played every canon metal gear game up to the point of this ones release ie every msxplaystationpsp release except the acid series and even some that werent
its hard for me to say thisbut this game is not that goodgraphicsnothing wrong here
in face its some of the best ive ever seenmechanicsthis is my major gripe
metal gear is a game focusing on stealth
traditionally in the series you get past enemies by either avoiding them entirely or separating them and taking them down before theyre aware of you aka direct combat is usually either a setpiece  boss battle or punishment for screwing up
this game punishes the hell out of you camouflage is  useless
even with a  rating lying prone and unmoving you will constantly be spotted by guards from far away
if they have line of sight to you and they all have about about  degrees of sight they will spot you instantly even from a great distance most means of evading enemies once spotted dont work ie lockers cardboard box etc
i tried utilizing them s of times not after being spotted ie when they find a dead body three rooms over and none of them ever worked even once
all enemies make a beeline for your current position even if youre not spotted but they see a clue like a downed body
usually changing areas or crawling into a vent unnoticed are the only means of escaping detection
when detected in most areas enemies will spawn and attack you indefinitely no such thing as cleaning out the area
cardboard boxes didnt even help me evade detection when i wasnt in a cautionalert mode and was tucked into a corner with other actual cardboard boxes enemies are very frequently scripted to do things when youre getting close not because they detect you but merely because youre at a certain point in the game like modifying their patrol routes checking out the passage youre coming down etc
in order to get by undetected you usually have to know the change in their behavior is about to happen so you can trigger it and immediately move to a place that avoids or counters their changed behavior
reacting to the situation in progress without coming to blows is almost impossible excepting if you are very quick with the mk tranq pistol which i was but see below while the game may look like multiple paths existthey really dont
almost anytime theres a branching path every path but one has an infinite enemyrespawn at that point
this either leads to a neverending battle or the ridiculousness of having dozens of sleeping enemies if you go the tranq route and are a quick shot because one two or three immediately run around from the corner the instant you eliminatetranq a guyuntil they all start waking upand then youve got the never ending battle again you can be trying to hide in the ranks of an advancing militia but the moment you fire a shot even if you kill the guy and no other enemy has line of sight to you the entire pmc goes into alert mode and starts spawning enemies to come after you i frequently found it easier even on the higher difficulties thats right i played it againi really really wanted to like this game to just run through crowds of enemies instead of making any attempt at stealthin short the gameplay is lousy
the worst in the entire series except for portable ops and that is lousy mostly because of the limited psp controlspresentationmost other reviewers mention the cutscenes
metal gear has always been longwinded
the series has always been wordy even the early msx games had pages of dialogue in an era where most games had  sentences
but this takes it to ridiculous levels
i still cant tell if the ending of the game is a parody or not in one scene a dying man appears to pass away no less than  times during a  minute monologue only to start talking again
the game will spend a  minute cut scene to give you  seconds of information
even skipping cutscenes just because of the loading between each one can make you spend upwards of  minutes between gameplay sequences
this game took me over  hours on my first playthrough and less than  on my second harder difficulty playthrough where i skipped cutscenesploti thought it would be hard to get worse than mgs in this department
the game does finally explain away many plot threads its been hinting at for  years and by hinting i mean hammering you in the face with but with critical bits conflicting or incomplete
the plot in this one is unbelievably dumb
i mean that in the literal sense
you know how in some games enemies do stupid things like stock large amount of clearlylabeled barrels of highexplosives for no reason and then use them to take cover behind in a fire fight
stretch that level of stupid out into a hour narrative arc and youve got the main plot thread for this game
many of these revelations are disappointing and feel pulled out of thin air but at least theyre resolved
well most of them are
i still cant fully understand what the whole liquidocelot story is
many of the character motivations are completely screwy at the conclusion not to mention one characters in particular is in complete contradiction to events at the finale of the game
without spoiling the featurefilm length ending the game i mean entire metal gear series teased at the ending it deserved and then blew past it to ruin itto reference previous games in the seriesi had high hopes for the ending of this especially after the masterpiece that is mgs
sadly this game took everything that was wrong with mgss story pumped it full of steroids or should i say nanomachines
and ruined every good thing about the gameplay it had been developing since the first playstation release
a terrible entry into one of gamings best franchises and an extreme disservice to one of my favorite videogame characters for over  yearsi am mystified by the number of really mediocre games that get high ratings on amazon
this is another one of them
because the price was only  i thought id take a chance but once again the highraters put one over on me
if you have played good shooters then you know what i mean and you should save your money
the gameplay is cumbersome and the cutscene movies numerousthis is not a game
this is a torture on a disk
i paid  for this game used
i could have a nice lunch insteadfirst time you put the disk in make sure to have much time as there is about  minutes worth of installation and cutscenes that are boring over the top and plain silly
after that you will spend couple of hours learning the ridiculous control system that is if you have enough patience
but you will not play no
you will watch further cutscenesthis is a well produced game directed by insane person made for insane people that enjoy mental torture and have way too much free time
these people will play this game until their fingers bleed just so they can tell us with their  star ratings how much we just dont get ita great many reviews have called this game a great game but a mediocre final fantasy title but this is deceptive
while there is no doubt that this is a mediocre ff title its also a mediocre game in almost every respect
worse still this game will probably sound the final death knell for the japanese role playing game dubbed jrpgits been a strange ride for both ffxiii and the jrpg in general
without summarizing the great past of the jrpg however it is safe to say that it has not found its niche in this generation particularly on the ps where jrpgs have both been scarce and hard sells
thats not to say there havent been solid titles eternal sonata tales of vesperia and star ocean have all been quite good but the american rpg has just been significantly better both critically and commerciallybut this was the one that would change all that right
well not exactlyremember that ff xiii was supposed to be the title that would save the poorperforming ps
announced years ago as one of the hot ticket exclusives people would buy the system just to play this game
or so the story wentbut some curious things happened along the way
first the title was delayed again and again for an extended period square wouldnt even hint at a release date
then in a shot heard round the fanboy world square announced that ff xiii would in fact be multiplatform
the sony fanboys squealed the xbox devotees delightedbut the ps found its legs with cheaper and better models and topnotch exclusives like uncharted 
and finally years after its announcement ff xiii was releasedand so we come to the biggest problem with the game this feels like a launch title
if this had been released in  or  it might have made serious waves
im sure its graphical quality would have wowed the masses and probably overcome its woefully boring gameplay
but its  no one is amazed by a prerendered fireworks scene no matter how many times you show it around  incidentally
weve seen uncharted  and the fact is these graphics dont improve on that game in the least
heck the movies hardly feel better than metal gear solid  and that was released two years agoits hard to point out anything exceptional about the game once you fail to be amazed by the graphics
the biggest praise has usually been handed out to the socalled paradigm system and indeed there was much potential here
the problem is that the system is easy to master and the game inexplicably introduces way too much chance into the proceedings
you can have a party with  paradigms that you really like only to have the game mysteriously change your party around before a big battle
you have no chance to reconfigure paradigms so youre stuck with whatever you are given
lamebattles come in two flavors easy and cheap
since you can switch paradigms on the fly and there is no mp measurement in the game you can essentially use an attacking paradigm for every battle
when your party starts to get hurt  and this is key people so listen  you switch to ahealing paradigm
then when you are healed up you switch back
ltgasps people who claim a great strategy in this game have obviously never played a game requiring strategythis works for around  of the battles
but every now and then you just get cheaped
as i mentioned above sometimes the computer will randomly change the makeup of your party and force you into a battle with a difficult foe say bahamut
you are then required to react quickly enough to discern all of your new paradigms and pick an appropriate one before he slaughters you which happens after around two attacks
of course it would be simplistic if you could just have chosen your own paradigms but thats not possible because of the random switchan even more egregious example is the stop spell bosses occasionally cast
during the battle with the final boss all of my party members were hit with stop simultaneously
i had to sit and wait it out
the problem
i died before the spell ended
what a jokethe item creation system is a joke
in order to get some items you must first find another item upgrade it and then dismantle it
there is absolutely no rhyme or reason to which items you should do this for eg
i obtained the sprint shoes which cast haste on a character from dismantling a tetradic tiara which casts protect veiland pretty much everything else except haste
what a joke
upgrading is laughable
there are something like  components in the game but they all do exactly the same thing add experience to your weaponaccessory
thus a bomb core will do just was murky ooze does
why even put all of these different components into the game
oh right  to make it look like the developers actually did somethingthe story of this game is pretty weak and the character interactions are a laugh riot
most of the game deals with a lot of existentialist hoohah about freedom of choice even as it is clear that the characters dance on puppet strings for the entire game
the end of the game is just baffling with a lame boss to boot
and the best part
expect to hear such rich lines as i wanted to tell the truth but i was afraid people wouldnt like me
i think afterschool specials were written better than thistheres plenty of other things to rail on about battles are too long the game is too linear with zero exploration etc
 but i think ive made the point
it begs the question why did square need so long to develop this title
the graphics are nice but they hardly wow the gameplay is linear and the design is lazy
the sad part of it is that while this game will assuredly sell pretty well the fact that it is the first ff title for this generation is more than enough to convince people to buy it it will no doubt hurt the overall market for jrpgs
this is not a game to get excited about
this is a game that you buy and play only to convince yourself that you didnt waste thumbs downi like the battle system and graphics
if you go into this game with the mentality of a beatemup with a good story by action game standards you will have fun
challenge yourself to get  stars on every fight and its a good action game
if you want a story interesting characters and exploration look elsewhere
the level design is awful you are travelling through a narrow walkway  of this game no exaggeration at all
there is very little story in the middle of the game out of a  hour game only the beginning  hours and last  or  have anything happening
the characters annoyed me personally but thats very subjective i know a lot of people liked themso to sum this up as short as i can
this is a beautiful game with lackluster story annoying characters and bad voice overs
there was a point in this game where every  min of game play there was a  min video that accomplished nothing
i saw a preview the other day for this game and their big line is the battle within begins
i agree with that line completely
i battled with myself for days trying to find the desire to finish this game
i would not recommend this game to the majority of gamers
stay away and wait for something worth whilei really should have listened to the negative reviewers
this game sucked
the story was way past kewl and i kept wanting to know what happened next and stuff
however i didnt want to actually play the game to get there
i wasnt having any fun
the gameplay was just atrocious
i was forced to control characters i didnt like and watch as the computer poorly controlled the ones i did like
in fact my control was laudable
there was an autofight button that i had to rely on in order to maximize my battle score
yes each battle is scored meaning that the less time it takes to win the better your rewards may be
thus using the autofight button is almost required
it just took all the fun out of it
btw forget how much i disliked the gameplay how is this a greatest hits in  when it was released in spring of 
why isnt prototype a greatest hit or mass effect 
well that was a waste of 
i guess ill just head back to me and daas one whos played every final fantasy chalk this one up as a disappointment
in full disclosure i favor the classic final fantasys such as ff ff and ff
this one just doesnt cut it
viewed without comparison its surely a good game but is a disappointment considering its final fantasy titlewarning  this review may contain spoilers depending on if i understood what the heck was actually supposed to have happenedwhen i am old and dying in my death bed i will surely think back to this game
in playing time i dedicated somewhere between two and three days of my life around  hours and i am fighting the gnawing realization that that is time that i am simply not getting back
at that point i will understand with each sorrowful declining breath that i could have used that time to frolic in an open field write a sonnet create something beautiful fall in love  but no i spent it on a grinding nonsensical jrpg
i grindingif you have any consciousness of this game at all you probably have heard from any number of sources that it is linear beyond belief
i really cant provide further insights into this other than to confirm it
not only is it a go from one point to another through a metaphorical though often literal tunnel it is constrained even under that paradigm
no branches or places to explore
no secret passages or easter eggs at least none that i found
no side quests until about  through the game
just go from a to b to c to d  not only that but there is no randomness in the number or character of encounters
for level  you will face  fights no more no less  pick up  items and view  cutscenes and gain a little over  exp
everyone who plays level  will face  fights pick up  items view  cutscenes and gain a little over  exp
as such everyone who plays this game will be at exactly the same level at the end of level   no variation
period
full stopok
youre saying
intro level  showing how to play the game  standard experience for everyone  no big deal  right
wrong
level  is just as bad  fights  items  cutscenes about  exp
so are level  level  level  level  level  level  level  level  level  and level   as a result there are just no real decision points at all you just progress down the road dictated by the rigid structure of the game
once you get to level  as highly flaunted throughout these reviews the world opens up and you can do some side quest but not really
you still have a small set of prescribed side quests abc which you must complete before you can get to a few more quests def which you must complete to get to a few more quests ghi etc
the result is that though the world is a little more open really it is kind of a big open field with a couple of side routes you still have pretty strict linearity imposed on youon last note on linearity which i think is a key point is that the game is easy in the extreme
if the game was any harder i guess you could kind of justify the linearity
that way you could at least use some strategy to get you through it all
however most of the game with a few notable exceptions is no harder than getting through a dvd menu
there is really no particular strategy for the first  of the game
you just keep pushing the x button to attack and change to healer if you really need to
as you have probably heard you only control one character at a time which really exacerbates the simplicity problemthe sum of these factors make the game really more like a long drawn out movie than a game
everyone is going to see the same thing as everyone else meet it with the same strategy as everyone else and end at close to if not exactly the same condition as anyone else
like stated above i would equate it kind of like navigating a dvd menu where you have to select each scene from the menu individually
i should add that thanks to the good people on the amazon review boards i did know that this was going to be linear going in but goodnessi should note that this would not be catastrophic if the story that you were grinding through was compelling and interesting which brings me toii storydid anyone see the movie hancock
will smith as a misanthropic superhero
anyone
well final fantasy xiii is hancock in video game form
but you say hancock was about yes yes stay with me here
hancock started out as a really interesting idea which disintegrated about half way through into some kind of nonsensical scifi voodoo which doesnt fit in the tone or narrative of the setup
they couple together and die off
what
same deal with final fantasy xiii
the premise starts off interesting though pretty convoluted
you live in a world called cocoon which at some time in the past was at war with another world called pulse
something bad has happened causing a forced removal of the population
ok  im with you  there are godlike creatures called im not making this up falcie which control and provide for the world of cocoon
ok got it
i can see where this is going
you become kind of superhuman helper called lcie not a typo which have a choice of either completing your mission for the falcie or getting turned into crystal getting a little into the jrpg weeds here but i can deal
as the story progresses you find out there are malevolent falcie which are trying to destroy the world to bring back their goddess which will destroy the falcie
they need to get humans to do it because of something about how humans can make their dreams come true
turns out that one or two of your party destroyed the world at some point in the past and have been in deep sleep crystal stasis actually for eons prior to the week earlier
really i mean reallynear the end something or other happens and im not being a wise guy here i truly have no idea what drove this you decide that you have to destroy the god that maintains the world
why is that a good thing
no idea
seems like a rotten idea to me kind of an endoftheworld kind of bad idea
but i guess it made sense to someone writing storyboards outside of tokyo
the end of the game made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever
had i been a twelveyear old stargate enthusiast maybe i could have worked my way through it but alas my dual graduate degree proved inadequate to decipher this one
i should add that this was the big payoff after  hours of playadded on top of this everything is told in nonlinear flashbacks
this might have been a sensible narrative structure had there been some kind of logic to the order that the story progressed
instead you start on day  go to day  day  day  day  etc
the result is like watching memento on a busted dvd skipping from scene to scene with no context of why things are happening or whos motivated by what
remember also that as this is a  hour game the chance that someone is going to play it in one sitting is pretty low
if you play it over a number of days or weeks you have to mentally connect cutscenes from any number of days or weeks ago to current motivations to make any sense not of what characters are doing now but what drove them back in the previous cutscenes that you saw two weeks ago
by a couple of days in i just stopped caring and just took it as it came ok i guess we have to save the world now no i mean destroy the world no wait we are going to save it
ah ill just go down whatever tunnel comes next
in a way it is good that the game was linear because if i had to make decisions to advance the plot i would have zero basis whatsoever for taking one path over anotheroh and there is a character named vanielle and one named hope whose heads you will want to clonk together a la curly and moe
their character progression is like watching reruns of full house  its not funny its not cute its not original and it makes you want to stick an icepick in one ear and out the otherok last pointiii presentationas you have probably heard the graphics on the game are secondtonone
ill admit it  a lot of it is pretty neat
the only problem i really have is that the art direction seemed a little overwrought and overdone  kind of like if you gave advanced rendering tools to high school freshmen to see what they come up with
the result was that there was interesting stuff to look at but it didnt really provide much narrative support
as an example there is a savage jungle which you have to go through with all kinds of crazed maneaters
ok thats fine but why are all of the trees made out of computers
wouldnt that kind of imply that nature had somewhat been conquered at least in the area where huge leafy computers have been installed where the trees used to be
i dont get it
of course it wasnt just this one stage that seemed out of place
everything in this game was huge in scale and of mindboggling complexity
every wall was a swirling mainframe every corridor was a sculpted masterpiece
what it kind of reminded me of was avatar where everything was just a little too faaaabulous to be engaging to the audiencewhat i really wanted to discuss though is the huge contrast between aspects of presentation that were done well and those that just seemed phoned in at the last minute
you may have heard of the weapon and item system which was really just a last minute slap it together job
the only things you collect in the game are materials which beyond their name and amount of experience they give you your items have no differentiating qualities
the result is that your inventory is chalk full of  different items which really could be represented by a number
similarly side quests are strictly beast hunts with no real story development or reason behind it
now why is it that i want to kill the  foot turtle
cause i told you to thats why
considering the linearity of the whole quest structure they could have easily thought up some kind of narrative to drive this part of the gameconclusionso as i lay dying years from now i will think back to final fantasy xiii
i will think of the hours lost but more than that i will lament the potential that this game had
i have been a fan of the series since vii
that game was literally years behind this xiii but even with the simplistic graphics and relatively short main story it was leagues more compelling and engaging
i get the sense that with each iteration of final fantasy the creators are getting further and further away from basic storytelling and fun relying on technical advancements to fill widening gaps in imagination and playabilityi give this game a  out of  stars
takes too long to develop  hours to the open part and along the way you are treated to mostly wooden andor stereotypical characters portrayed by only moderately talented voice acting
except for fang
the first half of the game is mostly just running down a corridor and pressing a a bunch of times during fights
i kept telling myself it had to get better and it did eventually but not enoughas for the openness of chapter  it is crap
there is a big field you can run around on takes about  minutes to cross and a few side loops that you can explore and a crap load of running from place to place back and forth across the same areas over and over
after being in the tube for  hours where you have zero choice on what you do or where you go this little field feels like freedom but the feeling doesnt last
it is just too small
i accidentally walked right through it and past it the first time
i had to backtrack
was that the part of the game that was supposed to be the open part
i almost missed itthis game is so sad
so much work went into making the monsters and ships that look like they are escaped refugees from a rorschach ink blot test
and yet somehow the game still sucks
hmmmon a personal note i love most things japanese
i watch a lot of aime and am trying to learn the language
cultural differences in their writing and characters dont phase me
i love the way that they tend to take their time developing their characters
that said this games story and characters just bugged me
especially venereal disease or whatever the heck her name was
perhaps she was less irritating in japanese but i found myself needing to suppress my urge to kill to keep from launching myself at my tv whenever she was on screen
grrrat any rate this game is at best a  star game
anyone who would rate it higher then that is a fanboy or just really enjoys being board
i have fallen asleep  times in front of the silly thing but persevered to the end
hey maybe they should market it as some sort of sleep aid
it works really well
edit i realizes i had to comment on the shivaedelon two women that interface to transform into a motorcycle which their male summoner then proceeds to mount its a rolling threesome
going to remember that one for a whilethe goodits a pretty gamethe badextremely linear gameplay no exploration at allhorrible storyhighly annoying cast of charactersboring battle system it takes no skillmajor grindfestai is stupidanimation is iffyplot of the game is boring years of developmentnote will go into detail later i finished this game a long time ago but feel like posting my thoughts here as well on amazoncom to help amazon gamers avoid quite possibly the worst game in the series up there with xii and xivi have been playing final fantasy since final fantasy i and over time the games have become worse and worse and this one tops it off
what do i expect when i play an rpg
well i plan on there being some interactions in towns with npcs side quests and other fun things
instead this game is just a looonngg mission
eventually the game opens up a little but barely and i kept wondering when is this going to get interesting
for the first  hours i kept saying well ill take care of equipment when i reach a town
well youll have a long wait if you do thatif i want to do repetitive missions there are plenty of games for that
not only is it repetitive and quite boring you can very rarely travel back to places you came from
theres never a break or slowpace in the game which most final fantasys have and thats part of the allure to them
one of my favorite things about final fantasy xii was toward the end your ability to go back and visit nostalgic places like midgar and where cloud met aeris etc
theres nothing like this here
the characters are rather boring as well and the story is cliche
i expect my rpgs to have a lot of fun side quests linearity and to be able to talk to npcs and engage in dialogueits hard to believe that final fantasy xiii cant even beat the quality of final fantasy iv
i was so looking forward to this and expecting so much and it turns out that square enix was just lazy
  i expect a lot more in the futurefeels more like an action game than a final fantasy role playing gameits not bad just seems like something is missing
im up to chapter  nowim assuming theres gonna be   things have picked up a bit but the first  or  chapters felt like a choreconstantly running away and not really feeling part of the story
all you really do is run fight battles run again cut scene run battles repeat
to me  is the last great final fantasy ive played
oh yeah the music is pretty bland
i really miss nobuo uematsus music in this series
you have no real control over your partyeverything is automated
this is even more handholding than the battle system in   people were already complaining about how that game felt like autopilot the whole way through
well this game makes that system feel like a high level chess match compared to this paradigm system
all you do is hit x and lrinse and repeat
people have been able to beat bosses while not even in the room
ive read the stories online and trust me its feasible that they are true
this is a very disappointing entry in a once great series that has been falling off lately in my opinion
id say try it if you are a long time fan but anyone else will wonder why this series has so much high regard if this is the first game they try
graphics do not save terrible gameplay and design
editi have now finished the game and much of what i said still applies
the only fun i had was when i got to gran pulse and the game opened up as many have said
if by opening up you mean a large plain that resembles the calm lands from ffx
i had more interest in finishing the game so i could grind crystarium points and money to fully maximize the characters than anything else this game entailed
this is the worst ff game ive ever played taking the title away from ff
in fact this game makes me want to download ff from psn so i can actually complete it and reminisce about the good ole days
ff and ff are still my favoritesfun stars is showing  for some reasonoverall  starsfirst off lemme say that i havent completed this yet
im at the very end though one chapter leftgraphics graphics are great
like really theyre nearly perfect
i remember back when i saw the preview videos thinking the graphics wont be able to look that good but theyre better
oh man
sound the music is great as is the voice acting but vanilles voice sounds a bit phony
theres only a few songs though that are repeated often
the main themebattle theme is starting to get on my nerves but its a great piece
gameplay the battle system is solid but it gets really tiring after a while
you cant actually control your character like in ff but you can only control one character instead of the whole party
plus the entire map is one straight line except for chapter  which opens into a big area full of side quests that consist of only hunt quests
there are also a lot of large monsters
good for grinding but not much else
plot the plot is extremely mediocre
skip this if you dont want spoilers  it seems like the characters were randomly generated
some of them are rather annoying and some of them are good but none of them are all that memorable like past ff characters
the entire plot revolves around a bunch of people who were unfortunate victims of circumstance trying to stop an old guy from destroying the world
so the group of people run around trying to solve a quest that they have no idea what it is so that they turn into a crystal instead of into a zombie
but the entire time the government is chasing them trying to kill them
this doesnt sound all to bad but its basically running through wastelands and forests which isnt all that exciting
now if they actually had you sneaking around and stuff thatd be fun but this is final fantasy  they try to add all these deep parts but most of the time they come off silly and annoying and completely unnecessary
the whole idea of the eidolons isnt great either
overall the plot is pretty weak and thin which is unfortunate because since the gameplay is so shallow the plot is all this game has
overall its disappointing to see a game like this where the graphics get all of the focus and everything else suffers
its a perfect representation of the current industry where people are more concerned with the way something looks than just about anything else
plenty of games out there are incredibly fun but because of the graphics not being perfect people will think it sucks
being pretty doesnt save this game from being shallow in just about every aspect
the combat while nice never really allows for much strategy and simply settles on making you figure out the right order to do things in in order to win
the sound while nice at times never really changes
the great battle music gets played to death
the plot is bland and gives you little incentive to care
there are far more enjoyable games out there so skip thiswow did i miss the boat on this one
i really did mean to buy this when it first came out but then i was dissuaded by all the negative comments about it too linear bad storyline etc
that i ended up putting it off for so long that the sequel is already coming out
yeah its been that long
despite all the bad stuff ive heard ive tried very strongly to stay unbiased in my feelings about this game before id played it
im going to give it a fair shot and form my own opinions based on my experience
so does this game measure up to the final fantasy standard or fall flat like a chocobo with a broken leg
well lets find outgraphics score  the technical aspects of the graphics are gorgeous everything is vibrant and the level of detail is astonishing
however sometimes it feels like theres too much detail
many locations are so detailed and filled with so much indistinguishable unidentifiable technocrap that you can barely stand to look at anything
i also felt there wasnt enough variety in the locations
sure that crystal tunnel is pretty when you first see it but after  hours of it i just prayed for something different
other than my complaints about the detail everything else is nice
the art style is sort of like a mix between what final fantasy x and final fantasy xii looked like
its not bad i just wished theyd turned down some of the eyefatiguing partsmusic score  what to say about the music
well its okay
it sounds fine to me and nothing grates on my ears
ive noticed a far wider variety of tracks here than previous ff games rockinspired pretty violin tracks even harmonica at one point yet none of them really stand out in ones mind or make me want to buy the soundtrack
the exception to this is the chocobo theme which i really liked
theres also the voice acting
im totally fine with most of the voices
vanilles voice occasionally annoys me but thats about all my complaints on that
i think that overall the voice acting is quite goodcharacters score  i daresay that only sasz is likable in the beginning
lightning starts out as a frosty bword snow is a bit annoying in his constant promises to save people despite his inability to do so vanille is irritatingly bouncy and chipper constantly and hope is a whiny little coward who i quickly grew to dislike
really out of all of them sasz is the only one who strikes me as having a relatable and likable personality right off the bat
lightning and snow argue constantly which gets extremely irritating to listen to vanille acts stupidly upbeat to the point where you just want to slap her and hope constantly whines about wanting to speak to snow im not going to say why its a spoiler but then chickens out whenever he has a chance to do so which also makes me want to slap him  either step up or shut up
it makes me feel such pity for sasz stuck with these irritants
so as you can tell im not feeling much love for these people
they do get better with time specifically about halfway through the game as they experience character development and get to be more likable
however thats a long time to suffer with irritating characters especially since ive played plenty of other games that had good relatable characters right off the bat in fact i even liked neku from twewy better and he was a terribly unsociable person
story score  well the story starts off immediately with a bang
much like the opening to final fantasy  the game just throws you right into some action no sleepy villages here
i personally liked the story and found it interesting enough
in many ways its a familiar tale of two groups that fear and despise each other and of a group of random people who get caught up in the struggle and must come together to try to heal those differences
its a pretty standard tale but i did enjoy the setting and atmosphere
i did not actually finish the story though stopped around chapter  the reason why will become apparent laterbattle system score  this new faster paced battle system sure is a departure for the final fantasy series
it feels a lot like legend of legaia if youve ever played that game where you have a gauge with slots and you fill the slots with attacks except with a really fast active time battle system going
it does feel at times with the autobattle that youre not really in control of things and if you try to input it manually battle moves far too fast to make this practical
i might sound overnostalgic here but i miss the old style ff battles that felt less rushed
technically active time battles have been around for ages but it feels far more frenzied in this entry to the point where it starts to really strain the eyes
i honestly started to feel mentally burned out after so many of these constant battles
the weird thing is that the battles move really fast yet they feel somehow more tedious than battles in the older entries did
this is especially bad during boss fights
for a game that purports to have quick battles bosses have way too much hp
like in the over thousand range
its takes ages to kill a boss even with the crazy quick battle system and is really tedious
now dont go thinking that i just dont understand how to utilize the battle system effectively because i do know how to chain attacks and stagger opponents and exploit weaknesses
the fact remains though that bosses get way too hard around the halfway point of the game especially when they start casting doom on your main character which kills you instantly when a timer reaches zero  no way to remove it
speaking of main character the character marked as leader is the only one you get to control and the others are ai
teammates
the ai
in this game is the best ive ever experienced so kudos for that
you can set parameters for behavior from the menu and switch between them in battle and thats how you control the party
the battle system as a whole is competent enough but im still not too fond of this system they changed so much that it doesnt really feel like final fantasy anymore and i just personally prefer a slower more relaxed pacegameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
i bet youre all thinking that im going to complain about linearity now
well youd be wrong
ive been playing rpgs for a long time and linearity is not something that bugs me
no theres something else here that killed the game for me pacing
i dont normally complain about pacing unless the game is really slow and boring
that is not the issue here
the pacing in this game is abusively frenetic
theres so much nonstop action that its desensitizing and instead of being exciting its boring
id played about  hours in the beginning and not once was there a quiet moment with the party where they could just chill and relax a bit
in fact the soonest time you come across such a point is  hours in
and thats only a town in a flashback and only lasts about a minute
well there is another quiet moment in a house about  hours in or at least you think therell be a quiet moment but its ended immediately by a battle literally bursting in through the ceiling
apparently their idea of pacing is to have a  second long calm moment about every eight hours
well there is another breather when you get to nautilus but these moments are still brief and few and far between
im a huge believer in the idea that an rpg should have balance
the exciting moments need to be balanced out with calmer moments so that the player does not experience mental fatigue
normally such a time would come in a town but as you may already know there are no towns in this game
the neverending dungeons combined with the harried and irritating pace of battles made me feel constantly stressed and yet oddly enough simultaneously jaded and bored with it all
the whole experience just feels unsatisfying  in fact i had previously resolved to finish this whole game because i am or was a final fantasy fan but one saturday night after finally beating the barthandelus boss battle which was really irritating and watching the pretty cutscene it dawned on me  im in another bland tunnel filled with monsters
i continued on only to be greeted by yet another boss whos crazy hard and casts the doom spell
it was at that point that the depressing reality of this game sank in after working all week i would be wasting my entire weekend on this crap instead of playing something fun
just the thought of pressing on only to be met with more endless monotonous tunnels of monsters and nothing much to look forward to made me feel sick inside
ive come to the conclusion that my time is precious im going to die some day
 and im much better off doing something more enjoyable with my time instead of wasting it on a game that isnt fun for me
thats when i decided to quit
yep i have a lovely library of games on ds that need playing
i think ill pick out a nice slowpaced point and click adventure gameoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
you might be wondering why my overall score is so much lower than the individual categories
well this is a case where this whole game is truly less than the sum of its parts
i remember the days when the name final fantasy was synonymous with quality  i used to buy these games on the name alone and was always amazed at how great they were
it pains me to say this but that time is over
this series has been going downhill ever since ffx and as much as i was sorely hoping that this would be the entry to change my mind it has only further cemented the idea that this series just isnt what it used to be
im sure there are some people out there perhaps even people who never really liked final fantasy before who enjoy this new direction since the game is technically competent and not that terrible but this game just doesnt do it for me
i hate to sound all nostalgiaridden and therefore apparently instantly noncredible but even if this game didnt have the name final fantasy on it i still wouldnt have enjoyed it
to me the series feels like a pathetic shadow of its former self a sickly thing thats just barely hanging on staggering around uselessly until it finally meets its demise or until everyone is so sick of it that they wont buy it anymore
maybe its time to drag it out back like a crippled chocobo and put it out of its miserytitle says it all this is not a true bluray level ff game a true blu ray hd gen console ff game would have had to consist of at least  full blu ray discsor gb plus but that would have meant  dvds for xbroke dvd player or dumb it down for xbroke
so they dumbed it down in another way to fit on xbroke they scaled the entire game back to fit on  dvds yet keeping the graphics fairly equal on both systems if they had made a true ps level ff they would of hadvto dumb the xbroke version down to ps level graphics to make a much longer game fit on  dvdsif you like to do the exact same thing fighting  boss guy for  or  hours and starting over again and again then this is the game for youone of those games where the more you play the worse your weapons get the more thousands of times you have to hit the enemy aiits a straight line of annoyance
i liked it at first but i dont have the time in the day to spend  hours hitting something over and overthe ff franchise seems to be targeting younger and younger gamers the t rating on this game is an overstatement by far
if you have children this might be a good rpg for them to start with
if you are a lifelong ff fan from the nintendo era this will disappoint you greatly
i will admit freely that i was not too fond of  or  of this series either it just seems to be losing the character development that other rpgs have notably fallout new vegas
this game should be classified as a gamemovie as you are really just playing a level to watch a movie more than you are fulfilling a role
i will not be buying anymore from this series sad to say
i miss the mooglesfinal fantasy xiii looks amazing handles smooth and attempts to bridge the gap between  total free form combat and turn basedthe combat system the game decided to go with i actually enjoyed
it blended strategy with real time and let you come up with some rather creative methods to attack or defend against enemies
however this game really doesnt stand up to the past juggernauts of final fantasythe game is linear  beyond linear in fact walk a straight line for  hours linear
you get a sample of freeroam before the game goes back to being linear all over again until the end
this is done on purpose though as it keeps the storyline flowing and allows you to experience all the beauty this game has to offer visually
i wouldnt of had a problem with the linearity of the game if when it did open up the game became a total blast
ffx for example was fairly linear but once you got the airship you could revisit areas to find secrets find hidden dungeons capture monsters grind to take on that uber boss you unlocked etcproblems i found with ff during the linear storyline linear character progression
grind all you want
after a certain point you simply wont be able to level up and i actually would max out my characters before even moving and now had to play mins of grinding though the map and didnt gain a single level up
you just store your cp until you somehow gain the ability to move another  steps on the grid
i understand they wanted boss fights to be epic and make you have to use strategy instead of over leveling and  hitting the boss  but still
just adjust cp values to make leveling past a certain point incredibly tedious dont just flat out shut the leveling down
imagine say  final fantasy    through a cave just goes sorry you gain xp but cant level up until you get to  save points were more abundant than items it seemed
every other screen was a savepointhealing spot
it almost made things to easy you have to actually beat the game to experience nonlinear play if you even could call it nonlinear
after beating the game you will unlock the final crystarium grid and get to explore about  the world free form
this would be fun if you still didnt have to walk to spots
youd warp in and then could spend mins just having to run where you have to go revisiting the same linear paths all over again just to touch some object
then you get to run all the way back i gave up grinding
it was horrible
the cp grid becomes unbearable after a short while especially once you go into the secondary classes of characters and some moves cost    cp 
money was nearly impossible to come across unless you wow imagine that grind some more on the same mobs to get rare drops
want an ultimate weapon  enjoy gathering  million credits just to buy the synth item
now have fun spending   mil again just to level it up
this was the first final fantasy game ever that i was unable to get an ultimate weapon
i maxed out the nd transformation at least but the rd required something like  million credits per weapon to createlevel the only reward for actually doing all the optional stuff after you beat the game was well unlock achievementstrophies and eventually work your way to  hard extra bosses
i did this often in other ff games yet it just seemed ff gave you no reason to actually progress there was no sense of accomplishment that the previous final fantasy games had
im not the only one to feel this as most of my friends just beat the game and put it down were all big ff fans and often strive for  completion  some didnt even beat the game and just returned it now i am not saying this is a bad game
there is just a lot of things this game did wrong in my opinion
the storyline was great and the game puts you on an amazing ride
perhaps the best ride since final fantasy  when it comes to storyline
the pros this game brings such as creativity graphics storyline character development voice acting etc  tend to be balanced out by the cons of  linearity no real reward for actually grinding or doing extra content terrible itemleveling system and virtually no reason to ever pick the game up again
because of this i have to really dock the gameif this was a new series a brand new rpg that came out of no where it would be amazing ground breaking perhaps a future final fantasy killer
however this isnt
this is final fantasy a genre that has honestly lost itself in past renditions
with each game the storyline gets better but the gameplay starts to suffer and replayability goes down and they begin to reuse ideas that didnt fly to well to begin with  end game optional content feels almost like im playing ff again with having to go all over the world finding monsters to fight but instead of calling them hunts you do it to free trapped souls o you expect more from final fantasy
ive said it to my friends time and time again
squareenix needs to dump the final fantasy name
keep the final fantasy formula but start making stand alone games
stop calling things final fantasy it isnt working anymore and just makes people expect more and more
or perhaps take more of a mgs approach and turn it into more of a cinematic story with limited interaction where you control the progressionadvancement of the character
overall final fantasy  if you are into rpgs and especially jrpg storylines  this game will not disappoint in the graphics voice and storyline category
even the battle system is actually a lot of fun to use
the overall picture however is cloudy and leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth when the credits begin to roll with sort of a thats it
feel  stars is my overall rating for the game
it only gets  stars for fun because honestly at first the game is fun to play creative and unique  as the game drags on it becomes less fun to play due to just how incredibly linear it is and once you beat the game there is virtually no reason to even touch it again unless you want trophiesachievementsyou send the wrong game now i have two copies and must sell it to anyone who want to buy it
wa wa wa waokay this is just going to be a bottom line to the point review
i have been playing the final fantasy series for years and have played just about every final fantasy game from ffi and even some off titles like tactics and crystal chronicles
now when ffxi came out i couldnt play it since i refuse to pay every month in addition to paying for the game itself
when ffxii came out i had mixed feelings but it still had enough stuff in it to make me keep playing and even though it really lacks in story its not a complete waste
i still like a lot of itso here we are now with final fantasy xiii and i can honestly say without a shadow of a doubt this is not final fantasy
this is some random barebones rpg that someone made that is only a demo of a game
a shell of a game
thats how i feel about this
its unfinished
this isnt the hard work of square the company square who has always delivered  percent into the final fantasy series
this isnt the work of that great company who delivered the masterpieces like ffvi ffvii ffviii ffix and ffx
this isnt the company who put tons and tons of hard work into the towns and shops and talking to npcs
final fantasy doesnt make you buy items from a save point
final fantasy is about going to towns and going into shops and going up to the shopkeeper and buying the items
and this certainly isnt the company who really delivered with battling and gameplay
fighting is no longer fun
there is no more fun battling enemies anymore
in ffxii i accepted the ai
but enough ai
i want to control all my characters
its not that hard to ask for to want to be able to control all my characters in battle
especially in an offline rpgupdate  i have to add something here that i also just found out
i found this on another sitethis also echoes similar comments kitase made earlier this month when he said that its very hard to make games on playstation  in the same style as the games in ffviis era had
making graphics will take an enormous time
he explained thats also part of the reason ffxiii is more linear than past final fantasy games
okay what you just read is completely unacceptable and just flat out laziness and stupidity
so because we have amazing graphics the gameplay has to completely suffer
im sorry but thats just total bs
excuse my language but this is just completely irresponsible and unacceptable for a gaming company who has always delivered  percent in the main series especially before ffxi released
now if i have to sacrifice gameplay for amazing graphics then i dont want any part of it
just bring back the old graphics but i know for a fact that if they can spend years on graphics alone then they can deliver an epic ff in every other area
come on
this is pitiful
just downright sad and patheticthis is just shameful
for about twenty years final fantasy has never let me down
but this game is just a demo just a demo of another random rpg with the words final fantasy on the cover
if this was truly final fantasy i wouldnt be rating it so low and having to write all these things
but its true this is no longer final fantasy
everything i have loved about final fantasy is gone
sure there are chocobos but you cant even ride them until late in the game
the only thing this demo of a game has going for it is the graphics
thats it
square are ripping all its long time fans off and so many people are just buying into it
i will not give in to their less than capable work
if and when they return to their roots and give  percent of their time and effort into a true final fantasy only then will i support them againi know that final fantasy xii was a big departure with the totally different battling system and removal of random encounters but for them to completely change everything that made final fantasy what it is well theres just no excuse
they just became lazy and are making money off of it
even final fantasy x had more effort and work put into it
dont let square make you a victim of their lazinessi am a huge final fantasy fan and have been playing them ever since ffiv
this is not final fantasy
it is painfully linear with boring and tedious combatheres a sample of gameplay  run in a straight line
get in a fight
continue on your straight line
get in another fight
keep going on the same straight line
maybe see a cutscene
keep going on the same straight linei am returning this immediatly what a total waste of moneyi am a major fan of the ff series
i have been playing them since the very first one appeared on the nintendo gameboy
my love for ff took off when i played ffvii and from that day forward i was hooked
ffviii came out and voice actors were introduced
ffix came out returning their roots and but still delivering a powerful classic
each ff that has ever been made has always had a multitude of key elements that make the game an addiction and difficult to put down
those area completely explorable world  wether by foot chocobo or flying craft  you could always explore every corner of the ff worlda battle sequence second to noneamazing graphicsthe ability to power up and devestate any enemy ever encounteredunique summons  edalons  bahamut is my favoritethe game franchise has always pushed the boundaries of video game entertainment until nowi will sum it up in this i still own ffvii
i still own ffviii ffix ffx ffxii never played ffxi because it was a mmorpg and i didnt want to pay for it
i am a proud owner of ffivi after playing ffxiii for  month i returned it and sold it at gamestop
i was so frustrated at the tunnels and the dungeon layouts i was so irritated that i never got to go into shops and sell stuff i got so irritated at the way the weapons were upgraded through the weapon system i was irritated that the team kept being split upi loved the battle system
i thought that was superiorly unique
i actually really liked the way they allowed you to fight with your summon creature
i thought that was awesome
i loved the cut scenes and the graphics
i was so excited when ffxiii came out but after playing it and seeing the same repetitive thing i got bored frustrated and then i got rid of itadvice dont buy the game
it is a waste of money
it is so below the usualy ff standards  that i am at a loss for words at how awful this game wastired of game developers being forced to dumb down games based off the casual market
squareenix takes a beloved franchise and surgically removes practically all identifying characteristics
your left with a boring husk that shares the name and technological prowess of the series with and action rpg mechanic
boss fights are easy with only a handful of difficult ones to challenge you
summons once again find little reason to exist seems to be an issue since ff
music i actually loved and graphics of course
the characters were actually pretty well designed but many do not have the development needed to make you care
by the end of the game your just so invested that you force yourself to complete to see the end but your terribly bored
the combat is at first interesting but it becomes tedious and boring because its simply a race to staggger the opponent then quickly destroy them
just disappointedi remember when ffxii came out after watching the opening scene i had a tear drop from my eye because i knew they did the game right
now after playing ffxiii ive had several tears flow tears because all the lower reviews are nonsensical crap tears that there are so many  star reviews and most of all tears that this game was privileged with the title final fantasylets start off with the good which undoubtedly is unanimous and undeniable amongst anyone who plays this game
the graphics are breathtaking the story is deep the character development is perfect the battle system mechanics flow smoothly and the game sucks you into a world unlike any otherso what could be wrong what could possibly substantiate a two star review
unfortunately plenty in fact way too muchfirst lets look at how linear the game is
at first i didnt think it would bother me i am generally one to go right through the game without a break to do many side quests
but the presentation of this game is indeed beyond ridiculous it is literally like running through a series of tubes from point a to point bgranted beautifully designed breathtaking tubes but tubes none the lessalong with this there are no towns
again i didnt think it would be that big of a deal just a slight change
but it soon became apparent i was exploring a world all but devoid of life
i feel like the game is more like a prototype for a final fantasy rather than the game itselfnext we come to the battle system oh lord where do i begin
the battle system is gorgeous but flawed
if you have one character attacking and another casting spells to reduce defense see saboteur eventually all the enemies defenses will be minimalized
it is at this point you would expect the character casting the spells to lower defense to join in and attack but you would be wrong
the character instead just sits there with a thumb up their explicit
this is mainly a problem early in the game where character roles arent as developed yet i cant believe it was overlooked
the problem is consistent when the computer uses the medic  it heals a character with almost full hp three times in a row while completely neglecting to heal itself despite the fact its in critical conditionalso the battles seem like nothing more than pressing x to autobattle
the battle system goes so fast it is almost as if the game doesnt want you to choose your characters actions only switch roles
i feel absolutely no sense of accomplishment after winning a battle it wasnt me that won it was the autobattle
sure i switched roles to heal and maybe cast some spells but all the actions were chosen by the computer
and i hear some of you screaming already ffxiis battle system is also impersonal how do i get off complaining about ffxiii
yes ffxii was impersonal compared to other final fantasies but it was still me modifying the actions it was me choosing what each character was going to do next
it wasnt the computer
i just dont feel the same accomplishment switching roles during a battle especially as unnecessary as it generally isalso with the battle system a large portion of the game  requires use of only two characters which further minimalizes any aspect of strategy
even after the game opens up and you get to form your own party theres hardly any change to battle strategy
attack heal attack heal
on tougher battles first use buffs  debuffs then attack heal attack heal
further reiterating the redundancy several of the enemies have way too much hp so you can do the same thing till your little hearts content
you think this games hard play the original ff or some wizardry this games a cake walk especially with unlimited resources
as with the eidolons dont worry about using them
it takes forever to build up enough tp to summon one on top of that their next to useless on bossesalso as a matter of personal opinion i cannot stand the paradigm system
i have to have six prerendered paradigms before entering a battle
why not just let me change one character role as needed instead of making me shift an entire paradigm
dont give me the strategy nonsense if i need a paradigm that isnt there i just click retry at the beginning of the battle and add it
i dont find it entertaining having to mess with six different paradigms to create nuanceseven though you control one character it doesnt feel like it
when exploiting an enemys weakness using libra the characters automatically attack using the appropriate spell
ugh its sickening  i have absolutely sense of accomplishment yet again the game does everything for me
does no one recall in the original final fantasies how good it felt to find a weakness against that one enemy who whooped you butt then exploit that weakness and get a buttload of experience and gold
you earned that experience and earned that gold dammit you found its weakness
not anymorethen again you dont even get money after battles in this game further making them pointless
sure their required to advance character skills but to what avail
now the computer will do more for me as i sit there and watch and continuously press x to do autobattle
gone is the feeling of going to town and upgrading all your equipment after hours of hard work and coming back into the world to dominate your opponents
gone again is that sense of accomplishment
and for what
i get to watch the computer do my battles for mei would dare say that if you compared every persons game file at the end of the game there would be little or no difference
where are my bragging rights for having rare unique items
my bragging rights for having the best equipment
anything
nothing
theres absolutely no replayability if you play through the game again youll have the same character development the same weapons and be using the same paradigms on the same bossesthere not even mana or magic points in this game for frick sake
in the original final fantasy only certain characters could cast certain spells period this has been a downfall in other final fantasies as well  diffuse roles amongst characters
but to have a final fantasy without any form of mana or magic regulation
blasphemy i say blasphemy
also after each battle characters automatically gain all their health back
again stripping me of any accomplishment i have from exploiting enemy weaknesses
status alignments
haha what a joke
hardly used at all and minimally threatening
and if for some reason i do die i just click retry
never mind scratch that if i start off a battle poorly and wanted i could just click retry
no need to be prepared for a malboro getting a sneak attack on me completely debilitating my characters killing two right off the bat yet by some miracle being able to make a comeback and kill the sob i just click retrynow let me touch on the equipment  or lack there of
the only equipment slots you have are one for a weapon and one for an accessory two for accessories later
no shield no armor no boots no gloves no helmet
you upgrade your weapon and accessory by finding components or winning them after battles
the game boasts a hundred different components what it fails to mention is that they all serve the same function  to give an item experience
sure some components boost how much experience an item gets but experience is experience theres absolutely no point in having so many components unless they each have a relatively different function
this feels like just another way to make the game stripped down while looking like theres more at playand on top of everything else the game chooses it also chooses your party sick
this is truly a game that plays itself
sure you get to choose your party later in the game essentially chapter  out of  greati feel like this is a bad joke
like squareenix was sitting around saying you know what would be really cool and funny well screw with the entire final fantasy fanbase
lets make a final fantasy with no gameplay where the computer decides everything yah lets also make it devoid of any content just one single line after another
but to keep people from thinking its a joke well have the best visuals the world has ever seen along with an amazing story and unseen character development
i wont lie they have something good here
they have something real good but its only the beginning
they have great characters and a beautiful battle system
they need to make the real final fantasy  one where i have a sense of control one where i have a sense of accomplishment one where my characters are my characters
this game does not feel like a game it feels like a demo or a very early beta
i cannot for the life of me understand how this got released and more so how so many people like it
i cant imagine that other people have played the other final fantasies enjoyed them and had this game appeal to them in any manner whatsoeveri have no problem with people calling this a breath taking adventure with a story and visuals beyond what the world has ever seen
i do have a problem with people calling this a video game
i just want to break down and cry when i hear people call this a final fantasythis game was very disappointing
i am an avid final fantasy fan
the graphics are nice however it doesnt make up for the lack of story that final fantasy used to have
i couldnt even finish the game due to lack of interestthe last ff game id played was ff vii
i think that must be squar enixs crowning achievement
things have definitely gone downhill from there and xiii wasnt worth the plastic it was printed on
it has such a boring combat system and boring gameplay
the openworld of ff vii was what i loved about it and that is very much gone
this is basically an extended dungeon crawl with cutscenes between itvisually and musically this is an amazing game and i wish the gameplay matched
sadly it does not
even the story had some promise but i got so bored with the gameplay that i couldnt finish iti couldnt get into this game at all
it didnt seem like a final fantasy game to me
it was boring to me and the characters didnt seem genuine to me
too little was known about them and i didnt find them interesting
i was also disappointed that you dont get to name your characters what you want to name them
it makes them more personal for me and in the past has been one of the best parts of the previous games
just because it is on the ps doesnt mean you have to make it all fancy
also there are ways to get around changing the name when they actually talk in the game
so was disappointed with that
it just didnt feel like a ff game to mei like rpgs mass effect  and  fallout  and new vegas dragon age and most recently skyrim are amongst my favorite games ever so when i choose to try out ff i was expecting something very different just walk fight mostly pressing x and walk again and fight again and if you turn back the same enemies are expecting you
after around  hours of this i decided to give up and made the decission that this game was not made for methe game is beautiful is the best thing it has the graphics are amazing the enviroments and model all look greatits too bad i was starting to get interested in the story but the repetitive gameplay made me quiti tried and made myself sit down and play through this game but could only make it as far as chapter  so discard my review if you think i dont have enough credibilitythe story is very badly told
it is uninvolving and uninteresting at all times
four chapters into the game i still have no idea whats going on what happened who i am fighting and why the characters are fighting
except that they die or something if they dont complete this impossible mission or something gay like that
all the cutscenes and cg scenes make no sense
the game throws random terms at you like falcie and the purge with no explanation as to what they are
i think you are supposed to learn about them as the story progresses but i just plain dont care anymore after  chaptersmusic is as unmemorable as ever
very generic and uninspiring sound
there is nothing profound or touching
maybe im not far into the game to hear the main theme
but ffx draws you in with to zanarkand right from the beginning ffviii opens with the powerful liberi fatali ffvi has the opera maria and draco and ffix opens with a very soothing prelude to melodies of life
for the most part the music in ffxiii is like generic elevator music it just doesnt help with the story telling at allcombat
combat was designed to distance you further away from the characters  you dont even get to control them
you just set up paradigms which is like preset ai script
each one focuses on healing physical attack magic damage stats boost enemy stats down etc etc
you get to only control the team leader but even then all you do is select auto chain and watch the animationthe combat is unexciting and slow
in chapter  where you dont have any form of physical damage output it takes about  minutes just to kill one single enemy and every encounter has about  enemies
and all you do is smashing auto chain the whole time occasionally switching from magical attack to healingduring the past few months ive forced myself to load the save and continue playing but i could never make any progress
i just dont care about progressing the story or learn about the characters or deal with the retarded battle system
the game makes me want to throw away the controller and burn the discit takes over  hrs of game play to be able to select your team
then i hit barthandelus boss and i am stuck
did i say this game has some extra hard bosses it losses the fun factor big time
it has come to the point of almost being ridiculas and i dont patenece to fight a boss twenty or so times to get it just right so i can move on in the game
i will try several more times and it will be history and trade it in before it losses any more value that is how frustrating this can get
then square enix is off my must buy liststarts out with a breathtaking video and the game just looks great ps
but pretty graphics dont make for a great gamedid i say this game looks great yes it does and the battle system grows on you but still not as good as ff xii
it is very linear unlike ff xii and if you dont beat a certain boss your stuck unlike  where you could go level up some more on other side quests and come backgraphics aside ff xii was a much better game
this is a edit from my first one and i give it a  for funfinal fantasy xiii is a beautiful game
the visuals and music are excellent
thats about all the game has going for it
the story isnt outstanding among the rest of the series but that is okay with me and not the biggest flaw with the gamethe game leads you from point a to point b on a narrow path with nice but unreachable scenery much like some first person shooters
the small map sizes are a step backwards from the large branching maps of final fantasy xii
can you believe that the bit zelda has more exploration than ffxiii
its truebattle system is excellent
its the best turnbased menu driven battle system in the genre
if you love battling you will love this game as thats all there is to do even the side quests are battles but with tougher enemies
there isnt any variety at all to the gameplay
fight run down the road a little fight run down the road a little more boss fight cutscene run down that long road more repeatwith modern day rpgs offering so much variety and exploration as well as compelling stories its disappointing ffxiii hasnt offered a comparable experience
it would have been an excellent game last generation on ps but the series needs to get with the timesonce i had a dream that i was stuck in a really long winding hallway and there were all sorts of scary monsters in that hallway with me
whenever one would jump out of the dark and attack me i would freak out but then realized if i could just reach the x button the monsters would die on their own and i could continue down the hallwayoh wait thats ffthis game has a truckload of hype behind it like every other ff game
of course we all know now the developers were spending all that money and time on graphics and strippers
take everything you love about ff and flush it down the toilet then make some other game that is not like ff at all
thats what this isits really obvious squareenix was just trying to appeal to as many numbskull gamers as possible like the reviewers at ign who are distracted by sparkly things
they amped up the graphics and oversimplified everything to a fault
you are barely involved in the battles and the free roam section of the game is a joke
you basically just walk forward and hit x every so often
maybe they should have just put you on a rail
i heard in ff you just need to yell teh words i win
to defeat enemies
that should make the game accessible for  of human beings and some animals like the parrot
i guess even some robots or a cleverly placed cassette recorder would enjoy the game as wellhonestly if you want to buy this gamewait til one of your friends buys it and then wait outside their window while they play for  min
they should soon grow disappointed and eventually ragefull
that will be followed by them throwing the game out the window and right into your handsa friend brought a copy of final fantasy  to my house years ago to show me what it was like
i fell in love with the idiosyncrasies of the game as much as the structure the art design and music
and like a spielberg summer blockbuster every few years a new final fantasy title comes out to wow its base of loyal fans and maybe draw some new ones
when i heard there was to be a xiii i decided to buy a ps because i knew no matter what that the bar would be set highfor graphics and sound and animations yes very high
every vista stuns every cloud bush bit of fog wisp of hair is painstakingly rendered in sparkling perfection but for story structure concept
this is the thinnest lamest final fantasy ever
anyone who ever played squares the bouncer knows what im talking about run down a hallwayfight somethingwatch a cutscenedo you want to saverepeat
its a fine formula for a brawler but a bad one for an rpg series thats known for diversity of gameplay ideasand thats not the only meat thats gone
unlike older final fantasies there is no deeply convoluted layered storyline here
everything is black and white to the point theres almost no need for dialogue
coccoon is good pulse is bad falcie force quests on people and arm them with magic to carry them out
pulse falcie create pulse lcie who have to destroy coccoon
coccoon falcie create coccoon lcie who have to destroy pulseif those last  sentences grated on your nerves at all nothing can prepare you for the hours and hours youre going to have to hear those same terms repeated over and over till they become maddening jabberwhat else is gone
a worldmap towns shops theres a streamlined online shop feature npcs side quests
none of those fun side jobs to enjoyably kill time
all there is to do is run or walk in a mostly straight line to the next point on the map and dont worry about returning to anyplace youve visited either theres no airship
just push forward on the pad and fight
and fightfighting is actually kind of fun
for veterans of the series the combat is a fast paced slam affair where you designate teams with different jobs to different members and then switch them on the fly
its fun to watch though you may not feel like youre really doing anything after awhile
as you progress you have to use more status enhancements and status attacks to get the edgei didnt finish this game
now before the fanboys start howling listen im  i work for a living and have other things to do oki gave it  hours and ive had enough
i frequent videogame forums extensively and nowhere have i heard that the game gets amazingly better after the first  hours or that the ending makes up for the grind
i dont think anymore should have to wait more than  hours for a videogame to pick up
its supposed to be entertainmenti bought a ps so i could play this game and its a dumbeddown excuse for an game that took years to make
give it a rent friends
rent it and see for yourselfim afraid that the final fantasy years are done
the new generation ff is just a big let down
like everyone has said its a beautiful looking game but thats about the best part
the battle system could of been awesome but since you only play one character
i mean really one character
and when that character dies game over
who thought of that
stupid
then there is no way to grind and get your characters stronger before you face these incredible difficult fights with no reward behind them
why would you do this to the final fantasy series
i waited so long for this game and what i got was crap
the story never really pulls you in and makes you want to find out what happens
your more like what is going on
with a bunch of characters you never feel connected to
i think rpgs are on a down hill slope
unless bioware has a hand in itsquare enix just puts out crap now
one right after another
cheap undeveloped games going for  a pop
farewell ff it was a good ride for a whiledespite every single review i saw i still decided to play this game  and yes its every bit as corny as you may have heard
the genius of se is that you dont realizse that all youre doing from battle  to end boss is swapping paradigmsthat is until you get to the end and battles start going past the  minute mark
its at this point that you realize youve been bamboozled by hd graphics and that dark reality is now staring right back at you linear  more props to se
never in all my years of gaming have i knowingly walked in a straight line for  hrs and when i say straight im talkin as an arrow
even the treasure chests dont inconvenience you with any semblance of being hidden
dont you get it theyre on the run
 haha ya right
running away from towns save points npcs shops  you know all that corny rpg stuff snow is a tool and the basis for the show tool academy
topic covered lacie falsie wtfsie
 years to make this game and this was the best you could do with enemy names
in the end it doesnt matter you wont be able to tell one from the otherse you need to attend one of biowares how to make a nextgen rpg rule  if youre going to remove aka streamline ha another industy jokeword everything your fans know love and come to expect from your games you better damn well have something to back that up besides graphicsnot everyone who plays your games is  that story was a joke once i lost interest in the story thats when  kicks in because immersion is gone and youre left with some weird guess my paradigm
gameso i think the title of this review says it all  this game was not a very good rpg because the story and character development were poor
at many points it felt more like an actionadventure release for the ps
here are a few big points to know about this game before purchasing or playing linear stories are often a great way to ruin an rpg  this game is not an exception to the rule at times i recognized melodies from the games soundtrack as belonging to other ff gamessloppy the graphics were excellent  a very impressive cg and realtime gameplay experience battle system was also enjoyable although im not sure how much i like having the computer play characters for me
having to protect the one lead character was also a drag final result  this game was fun to play for a while but got very repetitive and did not have a good enough story to keep the player interested recommendation  the team responsible for the next ff game should work a lot more on creating a compelling story and memorable characters  even at the expense of other game elementsthe last time i played final fantasy was when it was on nintendo which was like  years ago
i consider that old version ff iii more fun to play than this
i havent played ff since then
im only  chapters deep into this game and i accomplish that in less than  hours of playing
its basically one straight path of killing stuff to end the story for that chapter
along the way theres like dozens of save points
at each save point you can buy stuff or upgrade your weaponsand theres not much stuff to buy
again i only finish  chapters in this game and im not impress
fighting is too simple since you will be selecting auto battle most of the time at least thats what ive been doing
if your main character dies the game is over
you may retry the battle or reload from last saved point
whats the point of having potions that can resurrect fallen player then
i mean theres one or two other characters that is helping you fight
why cant i go to them to heal my fallen character maybe i can switch characters later in the game but that would be stupid
they should of had that option straight from the beginning
another thing i hate is that you can only equip your guys with one weapon and one bracelet
one weapon i understand but people can wear more than one bracelet on themthe only thing great about this game is graphics
other than that it is literally boring and stupid
the acting or voices is really annoying
i rather put the tv on mute than to listen to these characters talkbottom line this game makes no sense at all
no free world to explore
no towns or shops to buy stuff come on buy stuff at save point
thats so boring and too easy
too much cut scenes
will this game be more fun if i keep playing or would it be the same throughout
im guessing its going to be the same throughout which is one straight path to victory
dull and boringwhile this game can be somewhat entertaining and flashy the story and gameplay lack the elements that all other fantasies had
while trying to combine elements of ff and actionadventure gameplay squareenix ultimately failed to deliver a worthy product to their very loyal fans
with that said i still managed to obtain some fun out of it
i accumulated over hrs of gameplay most of which was satisfying
however the thought still lingers of how i miss the oldschool rpgsdont get me started on the story
its too complex and good luck following it most of the time
i gave up a long time ago trying to comprehend the full story and i chose to just take these plotpoints lightly
this cocoon and lcie business doesnt garner a good story for any fangameplay mostly consists of button mashing
the occasional paradigm shift is the form of strategy
the summons are ultimately useless and thats bound to upset any ff fanso whered the fun come from
hunt quests and other side quests are pretty fun
im just sad that the main story didnt compliment that fun
grinding wasnt too bad and the weapon upgrading system gets workable
the crystarium that parallels with the ff system is pretty cool and getting experience was not frustrating
all in all some parts of this game are great
unfortunately these parts arent in the main storyline
it was especially lame that the ending doesnt warrant a postgame at all but it gives you a pretend one instead which doesnt support the story at all
it couldnt have been hard to weave a postgame into the storyhope this helps
theres plenty other ffs to play out there that wont disappoint you
i kept playing through the disappointment and found fun bits here and there
the truth is however that most gamers will pick it up and set it down within a week
only the few patient and loyal will move on with the gamesummary  you should not buy this game and also do not believe that it gets really good  hours in garbage that people always spout as i explain belowlike many people who played this game i have to say that its a pretty huge disappointment
i ignored the relatively poor rating on amazon and assumed that people were just being cranky about the new combat system
i played through about   of this and kept hoping for a big payoff at some point
i finally realized that there wasnt going to be one and that id just wasted  hours of my life
the entire game you spend running down tunnels with different wallpaper fighting incredibly monotonous battles over and over again then watching really lame cut scenes the characters in this ff are completely lame with impossibly to decipher motivations for what they are doing
especially early on the battles are always painfully easy but you have to fight or your characters arent going to get enough experience and will end up underpowered in this ff you can actually see the bad guys and can skip some of them if you want
i dont really mind the new combat system but it basically requires you to do nothing more than hit x a few times over and over again unless you are fighting a boss which makes it really boring
there are very few city or hub areas basically no exploration and very little npc interaction which really takes all the character and flavor out of the game
its really more of an interactive movie than a gamebut a really bad one with boring characters with nonsensical motivations and a story that at   of the way through still seems like nonsensei realize you could say that some of these criticisms apply to all final fantasy games linearity boring fights but i liked the other ff games i played  and 
for example the ones ive played are also very linear even though they give the illusion of freedom even the illusion is almost entirely absent here
somehow though the linearity and the monotony of the fighting here is so much worse than ever beforebefore i leave i want to address the whole well it really hits its stride about  hours in thing that i always hear
first of all a game that takes  hours to hit its stride is a horrible game
it is true that about  hours in roughly rs of the way through the game id guess you reach a wide open area that you are actually allowed to explore and given some freedom of movement
the only things you can do here are  fight challenges against various boss type enemies i think you win rewards and  pick up item orbs and buried treasurei think its possible to use a chocobo to look for buried treasure and to reach some otherwise inaccessible treasure orbs
i explored a fair amount but never messed around with the chocobos and only did a few of the challenges
there are no npcs i mean literally  anywhere or really anything that interesting in this area except that like the rest of the game its very nice looking
in order to advance the plot you have to leave this area and go back to trudging down tunnels fighting stuffyou might even say that the part of the game everyone says makes the game better is optional except that you probably need to explore and mess around there for a while to level your characters high enough to comfortably continue
clearly this is not enough to somehow make an awful game goodobviously it looks amazing but thats about all it has going for itgameplay tip since i always give one in reviews you cant actually level up until a few hours into the game it will be obvious when
so until you reach that point just run by as many enemies as you can because there is no reason at all to fight themedit i have decided that  star is too harsh considering that this is a playable bug free game
so im moving it up to two stars
but my opinion of it hasnt changed at allafter getting some criticism for the linearity and annoying characters in ff youd think square would never make the same mistakes again
and especially after ff i had some hope for the series
not anymore
not only did they come back to linearity and annoying characters they made these things infinitely worse than in   five of the six characters you get are either mildly or extremely annoying and of course the one that isnt is the one you get in your party last and it takes forever to get your entire party together in one place btw
this could be overlooked however if only the gameplay made up for itbut it doesnt come close
the game is ridiculously linear with the only chance to do any sort of exploring being near the very end of the game
and even then there are only like three directions you can split off into with one of them being the way you have to go to progress the story anyway
get the picture
its like youre playing gears of war with the added expectation that you somehow build your characters upwhich brings me to the crystarium system
wow what a letdown
unlike in ff you get practically no freedom to develop each character as you see fit
each character has their own list of abilities and stats that can be gained which means if you want one character to be a medic white mage for you ff veterans you can do this in theory with any character but some will never be near as good as others no matter how bad you want it
and of course some roles arent accessible to some players until near the end of the game anyway
but it is always clear they want you to do it their way not yours
theres one character that gets a ridiculous amount of hp while most others fall dramatically behind
you can find discussions on the internet about how this character is better than that one because heshe can learn an ability the other cant
its ridiculous
why bother giving us the choice at all when its obvious you think there is only a couple of right ways to do itand the linearity doesnt stop with the lack of exploration or lack of choices when it comes to how you develop your party either
even in battle there is usually a right and wrong way to win the fight
how do you know this
well once youre done fighting and you get to feeling really good about how well you kicked the enemys ass a screen pops up with a rating of your performance
you see it plain as day  out of  stars
the game is essentially telling you you failed at doing it correctly
and this really means you didnt win the fight fast enough
its all about speed in this game
and its more than just a rating it determines your chances of getting any items after battle
and even that would be acceptable if it was consistent
yet some enemies are noticeably more difficult to get five stars on no matter what strategy you use
plus its not like you can go back and try most of these battles again because as i mentioned the game in general is unbearably linear
 or more of the locations cannot be revisited not even near the end of the gamethe battles also operate by only allowing you to assign roles to two of the characters while in battle youre never allowed to directly control their actions
you can switch their roles in the middle of battle but you cant ever customize what they do like you could in all the others
and you cant switch to start controlling one of these other two in battle either
this effectively means that if the character youre controlling dies the battles over
theres no such thing as reviving the leaderanother thing that sucks about the crystarium that i almost forgot is how it only lets your characters advance to a certain point and then you have to proceed with the storyline before more of it is unlocked
and it takes forever for every character to be able to even begin learning another set of skills job class for the veterans once more
so even if you try to levelgrind in this one by running back and forth along the narrow corridor it gives you throughout most of the game hoping enemies you beat will respawn theres little pointlets see here
money
takes way too long to get the gil you need to do anything of importance
and you need it in this game to upgrade your weapons and accessories which you will need to read a guide online or buy the book to do efficiently because you get no hints at what each choice in upgrading your weapon is going to really do to it
you have to use components to upgrade with and have no idea how many of each component youll need to get the job done until youve already used them upthis game is not all bad
i like how if you die in battle the game doesnt make you start from the last save point but just outside the battle so its less frustrating that way
i also like that you dont have to keep track of mp and the game restores your hp and all that after every battle as well
it has a pretty good story though it suffers from awful voice acting and narrative a good presentation both in and out of menus and of course amazing graphics
it really does look gorgeous
but it is mostly a game for show not very fun to play at all
not imo anyway
and it certainly does not contain half of the things that made the series great all these yearsps
 i wasnt dissing gears of war earlier just pointing out that the linear gameplay doesnt work for rpgs
not at alllike most final fantasy fans i was extremely disappointed with this installment
it really is that bad
its pretty to look at and the pleasure that gives you goes away in about five minutes after you realize that the environment is nearly completely lifeless
seriously almost every area is completely empty  no treasures nothing to explore and for hours at a time not a single conversation to be had  just endless mashing of the x button for the occasional battle
also the story really is that incomprehensible
honestly after about  hours of playing the game i still couldnt figure it out  despite detailed and boring recaps every time you load the gamethey try to change it up by introducing a paradigm system  which is supposed to streamline combat but ends up just being a poor substitute for allowing you to control your characters actions
want to heal
sorry first you have to change to another paradigm  and then you can mash the x button for a bit  and maybe youll heal in time
if youre not lucky then the enemy will kill you in one hit  thus ending your game
its just not funthe cutscenes are equally dull surprisingly  lots of whining on the part of the characters for the most part and the otherwise decent performances of the voice actors is wasted on skincrawlinglybad writing
it would be more tolerable if there were anyone else in the game to interact with but no  you can sort of vaguely hear people muttering at times but for the most part youre on your own in depressingly empty area after areasupposedly it gets better later on in the game but its just not worth it
trade it in for something that wont bore you to tears for  of the game
i gave up and traded it ini give it two stars for the pretty graphics otherwise this is a bummeri havent played a new mario game since super mario  and my experience with that game left me feeling like it was an unexceptional and overrated game with the biggest complaint being there were simply way too many empty areas throughout the game resulting in too much pointless roaming around to do
lack of enemies severely hurt super mario well more than  years later im now playing super mario galaxy that i received for christmas and uh oh
the same exact problems i experienced with super mario  have returned and in most likelihood those problems probably never even left in the first place so im definitely not kicking myself for ignoring every new mario release over the last several years
it appears like i didnt miss anything special about the mario series at all the last  years
unless utter disappointment and frustration qualifies as special
didnt think sothe number one biggest complaint with super mario galaxy is that its very hard to control marios movements
you think im terrible at video games
guess again ive been playing video games for over  years and learned to deal with a variety of different movements many of which were really downright confusing and discouraging such as a fair share from the nes console for example but nothing has ever given me as much frustration as this game hasfirst of all mario doesnt move with nearly as much speed as he did in the older mario games and in fact theres not even a run button
why is this
i have no earthly idea
when you take away the speed you inadvertently take away the crucial element of fun
simple as thatfurthermore a lot of times the camera pans out so you can barely even see where mario is going or what mario is even doing
this results in a lot of unfair cheap and untimely deaths
its ridiculous that i keep falling over the edge and into that huge orangeblack spinning black hole of instant death that constantly lurks below simply because i cant see what mario is doingoh and no its not my television screen either
its perfectly fine
my eyes are fine too
the fact that marios movements are so slow and stiff also contributes to many unnecessary deaths
this is not why i fell in love with the mario series back when i had an nes and super nes either
had super galaxy been my first exposure to the series i would have thrown the game in the trash after giving it  solid hours of my precious timei wish the movements were as precise and fluid as the ones found in the spyro the dragon series specifically the original spyro the dragon series that appeared on the playstation one console
that particular series did d movements perfectly not to mention it was a heck of a lot more fun running around collecting gems completing mini games interacting with many unique characters and checking out more interestingcreative environments than the ones included herecertain objectives later on in super mario galaxy require exact movements in order to complete and if youre off just a tad you will fall to your death over and over again
its quite annoying and to be completely honest despite what people think even the hardest of the oldschool d mario games such as lost levels and yoshis island were significantly less frustrating than this
at least i knew what i did wrong when i died in the older games and learned from it next time
theres no learning here you either land safely or you dont
not much in the way of a learning curveoh and those levels where youre positioned on top of a huge clear rolling ball and forced to use the wii remote to steer it around correctly are in my opinion the biggest annoyance ive ever had to deal with in a video gameoverall do not buy this game for your kids  super mario galaxy was designed in a way that requires gaming skills of near perfection
if you dont have the patience to perfect your skills surprise surprise this game will have you throwing your wii remotenunchuk at the tv screen countless times
thats a promisethis game has great graphics and is a huge game with lots of fun things to do
however there are a lot of extremely irritating levelsthat send you plunging to your death over and over
i dont mind dying fighting something but falling to my death after the th time is just iritating and not fun
this game would easily be a  star must have video game if they would drop the iritating and not fun at all plumet to your death scenes
if you buy this game you will probably love an awful lot about it but i do believe there have got to be a lot of people like me who can only take falling to your death so many thousand times in a game
after another month of playing i have to drop my ratings down lower
somebody ought to tell the makers of this game that the number one goal is fun
not nit picky demands on very precise movements with controllers that are anything but suited to such things
this game could easily be a  star game if not for the countless fall to your deaths daredevil levels that are hard and frustrating enough to make a person hate video games altogether
they could make a difficulty setting for this game and fix everything
easy for even a  year old
normal something that a  year old should be able to win eventually hard and if they want to they could even add a criminally insane difficulty level for those who enjoy making no progress over and over and over again
nintendo think more enemies less cheap deaths and what ever happened to difficulty levels
remember fun fun fun
if it is not fun why bothermario has lost his way since the days of the  bit nintendo
while super mario galaxy is an improvement from sunshine i think that mario  is better than galaxy
the best of the super mario series of course being  and i found the orientation of galaxy to be disorienting and uncomfortable
as mario you move from planet to planet as levels
the object typically being to find and collect the super star
each planet is like a ball that you run around on but the camera does not change perspective
graphically this game looks good for a wii game though only somewhat better than what you would expect from a gamecube
the music scores are orchestrated but uninspired
the music from the old d mario games were much more spiritedwhile i will say visually and musically this game is as stunning as it gets
i give that category a now as for the rest around star  i lost my interest in continuing
now im a veteran of playing games that you continual die dk country so let me disclose that first
dying over and over and over again trying to get the comet stars became frustrating when i knew that if this game had better controls it would have been a breeze
the stupid pointing of the wii remote and using the nunchuck to move really make things a choir and overwhelmingly frustratingif you have a ton of patience and dont mind the uncomfortable wii controllers than i highly recommendim an old school gamer and honestly if your like me and grew up playing mario then this game really isnt for you
this game is aimed at a much much much younger audienceages  at the least
not saying that mario is an adult game it has always been a children game but its difficulty level made it a challenge for everyone
super mario galaxy holds your hand to the very end of the game
the game almost feels like no challenge at all
there is no striving to get that up that special star or anything really
its all almost given to you
when i saw i was running around with  lives  i knew something was wrong
if you ahve  lives in a super mario game your either the game master or a true gaming beast
in this i was absolutely neithermatter of fact i barely did anything to get there
this game was hardly a challenge at all
most mario games are known for their level of difficulty as super mario has never been a breeze to walk throughunless you spent hours on it like the mario pros
i was dissapointed to see that nintendo had eased up on the game for the wii release
of the later mario games i would say super mario  was probably the best
it was difficult challenging and you had to really play it to beat it
super mario galaxy is a great childrens game for young children but this by all means is not the mario that a nintendo gamer is looking foreste es sin duda el peor de los  smash bros que han salidoinclusive es igualito al super smash bros melee osea no mejoraron en nadamejor me quedo con smash bros de nintendo  que si es un juego de primerawhen the original super smash bros came out its all the kids in the neighborhood wanted to play
super smash bros melee made the experience richer and more satisfying
this title feels like a step back
not only does it feel slower but if youre playing with a wii remote and nunchuck its considerably less intuitive with its controlsi was very interested in the idea of a single player story mode but found it to be boring even as a coop experience
single player in ssb melee was a lot more fun
i feel like this game does a great many things right for the hardcore fans but for a casual gamer like me i found it relatively inaccessible and often boring
a pity because some of the best multiplayer map design of the series can be found in this gamedont get me wrong smash bros fans this game is fun while playing against other people and addictive
however i do feel the game does get old after awhile like all fighting games
the game can also be annoying at times while your characters become small to compensate for something going on in the background
and god help you during some of the stages when there is so much chaos going on you lose track of your character let alone what the heck is going on
maybe thats the whole point or maybe im just getting oldi read the reviews here and decided that i would give the game a try
i really felt that this was for a much younger audience
i played it for a couple of hours and worked through the minigames but found myself getting bored
i could definitely see how this would be a good party game or an ice breaker
i decided to resell my copy and buy something else like elebits which i really enjoyi cannot pinpoint what bugged me most about this game except that i think i was expecting a lot more
no love lost i know that a lot of people really enjoy this game
i personally am having much more fun with sports elebits and the trauma gamei am a pc gamer never ownedplayed console games before
i enjoy the wii sports on my brand new wii quite a bit although it is clear they are not full fledged games
smooth moves is the first title i actually bought
started playing today and completed the single player mode in only about  hours
although the multiplayer mode is available it has the same set of minigames as the single mode
it seems to me that fifty dollars is a very high price for what is esentially a  hour gamei also cannot tell that i had much fun playing through the game
it certainly keeps you busy and the usual gamers urge to get to the next level is the only thing which kept me going
the minigames graphics do not have a single style and often look like they are drawn by first graders
i cannot see how this is the whole point of the gameplay
there are indications that the studio cut some corners in making this title for example there are two sets of minigames with jimmy t disco guy one with little cats and the other with dogs
the cats and dogs are dancing exactly the same in both sequences and the only thing which was changed was their headsafter playing though this game i feel tired and exhausted
i wasnt expecting much and somewhat prepared by the negative reviews here but i am still dissapontedthe graphics are excellent the lighting effects are realistic and aside from some hokey motion controls the game play is very fluid and natural
all in all i like it a lot but its got a bug thats almost a game killer
in the refinery sometimes the elevator never comes down sometimes it comes down but wont go back up and always when i actually make it up the elevator it freezes up completely when i get to the top and not like one of their it looks frozen loading things but locked up for over a half an houri finally found a way around that particular issue by restarting the system and loading the previous level but on a console i find this kind of stuff inexcusable
on a pc game ok theyve got a billion possible configurations to contend with
bugs are to be expected but on a console
and whats worse as an exclusive theyre not even having to worry about consoles from different vendors just  system  vendor and a handful of hardware configurations
they had time to make the loading screens between levels move around with sixaxis but they couldnt be bothered to fix these big bugs so im docking an otherwise good game  starshuge fan of killzone  on ps
love most fps games and rd person shooters so i have a wide base of controls and feels to compare this to
killzone  is just plain not fun to play
the graphics are awesome the design is really cool the level layouts and variety of scenarios is well done vehicle levels running around vs hold a spot etc
the controls just kill it sorry to say
no amount of option tweaking can make it not sluggish unresponsive crappy and infuriating
trying to aim at an enemy no matter is you are aiming down sights or hip firing is damn near impossible
it just gives me a headache every time
i gave it plenty of chances i made it through about half of the game but just couldnt bring myself to play any longer
its difficult to explain why this game sucks so bad unless you actually play it so i would advise downloading the demo if there is one or rent it
but spending  bucks on this is a plain old rip off because these clowns who developed it thought they were doing something artistic by making the controls so sluggish and horriblefirst the bugsmy screen frequently paused during the middle of movement to load more dataone time i couldnt even get past a level bc my team mate rico just sat there and wouldnt come to the door to open iti played it from the checkpoint half a dozen times and even restarted the ps  times with no luck
finally i had to restart the leveli also want to mention that the glitches werent goofy glitches where i was standing in a corner jumping and hitting reload and then melee and i transported kind of things
they were all glitches that happened while doing the normal linear campaignthe campaign is extremely linearthe aiming mechanics are atrocious on normal and just plain bad on high precisionmovement and aiming in general were a chore
i am ok with gun recoil and moving slow when wearing a bunch of armor
i am talking about your gun floating around moving your reticle left only to have it go left and then move back right
letting go of your left stick only to have your guy gradually walk back and to the right or slowly spin left
there is also a difference between movement being slow and clunkyfor anyone who has played gears of war consider this gears of war  beta without the cool features and with tunnel vision
the field of view was just to narrow
it even has the same sound that gears uses during checkpointsi am also personally getting tired of games being lazy about graphics and just calling it gritty
then they get great graphics scores because of the dark feel
or like one reviewer said that it makes you sick bc it is so real
no realism does not make you sick
a crappy job on a game makes you sicklastly i am a completionist
i like to finish everything no matter what
not only did i not finish this game but i quit during the fight with radec the last guy
i probably had  minutes at the most to finish the game and i just quit bc i could not take it any morejust a note to anyone who wants to flame me for being an ms fanboy due to my raving about gears
i bought a ps bc i was so sick of ms and also wrote them telling them why they will never get another dollar from methis game is an atrocity
first let me start with the single player too linear short controls are clumsy and make it hard to aim and its basically the same throughout the entire game
the multiplayer was fun for about  minutes until i realized if you have a rocket launcheryou win
the controls make multiplayer an angry experience
the levels are crappy and make it an all out chaotic event which is good if there is a certain amount of control
there should be no teams because you cant tell who is who
the game should be  dollars
the graphics are pretty though
not a very good rent definitely not a good buy
spend your money on a good game like metal gear solid or little big planetshooting in this game is one of the most refined i have ever played
the graphics are incredible butif the game was just about shooting forward and watching the bullets hit it would be a unfortunately the game suffersthere is no story what so ever the acting is about as poor as i have ever seen
most noticeable is that when your fighting the ai just continue to pop out of the ground indefinitely for ever
you can shoot at them all you want and they will keep popping up out of the ground you could shoot  ai and it would make no differencethe ending of the game relies so heavily on re spawning it makes you think what where they thinking during the  years of productionthere is no climax to this game each level is the same  guys pop up and come towards you the next scene  guys pop up and come towards you that is it
that is all there is to it
you have a brief moment in a tank that controls like an awkward mess
each level is almost exactly the same with a different backgroundwhat makes this game more disappointing is that it took them  years to make it and this is all they could come up withits more based on you walking forward than defeating the enemy
you will enjoy picking it up and shooting but will likely get bored once you realize it doesnt make much difference how many guys you kill they just keep popping up and just running forward isnt much for strategyadding some vehicles story acting some variations and cut out all the res pawning this game could have been in the upper skillzone  review score  rentali own both a ps and xbox  and i think therein lies the problem
ive noticed many of the ps exclusives have their own feel
i enjoyed resistanceit felt tight enoughthis game is beautiful
i ordered it as soon as it came out and had high hopes
maybe its just me maybe its the game maybe its the ps controllerbut i hate the control scheme
the aiming felt loose and problematicno where near as tight as cod or left  deadagainif this is a ps versus xbox feel it might be more to your tastes
as i said its a first rate game production wisei just didnt find myself having fun playing italsothey went to great effort to make you feel into the gameso you get camera shake as youre walking
i appreciate the effort but it gave me motion sickness
i havent had a game do me like that since doomwhich i still cant play for extended periodstried getting used to the controls but just couldnt do it
i tried the other control schemes but none seem to work for me
online games are laughable and just flat out boring
the story wasnt even worth it
im looking forward to any updates to make this game more enjoyable until then i will continue playing cod the st game was ok so i figured i would give this one a try
i should have saved my time  money because this game was more frustrating than fun full of glitches  the game play is not that great
i tried killzone     but after two tries i am done with this seriesthis was the first game i bought for the ps and i was heavily psyched because i liked the first kill zone
the story was great and it had a few characters with some potential for growthnow comes kill zone  revamped doesnt even begin to look like the first kill zone  which it shouldnt because its supposed to be a next generation game
it is true the game is waaaaay waaaaay pretty so pretty that amongst the back drop of concrete gray walls darkness and smoke  you wont be able to see who or what is killing you before your screen goes black and white while your riddled full of holesit appears to me this game seems to be a better online arena than a singleplayer game judging by the  star supporters and i agree it probably would because the human error and curve everyone would have to use in order to hit something would be equally disturbing rather than being shot anywhere and everywhere because it seems the helghan army took lessons from the us marine corps and have become crack shots  all of themi have shot weapons before thank you very much but sniper rifles in this world act like pump action shots guns
try aiming to hit something vital and its as if you went on the range after binge drinking for  days
you might as well wait for the suckers to break your  line of defense so you can hip shoot to kill them  and it will take aboutohwhat to  rounds before you down a helghan soldier
i think some high ranking officer should send a message back to their hq in thanking them for equipping their military with crappy weapons and even more substandard body armor
i mean how many times can you be pinned down by armored tanks and drop ships before some real support arrives
wow
i guess the idf never though about oh say   air support perhaps
yes let us just get say  human beings and treat them like the old soviet army at stalingrad
just rush in and hopefully too many bodies will pile up for the other side to fight back and maybe a victory can be carved from itwhich leads me to another grip that will have you contemplating hanging your kill zone  cd out in the pasture and using it for rifle practice
the npc characters
your  team
they are  percent useless during crucial engagements especially that one mission with the  minigun toting guys
my god  what   folks and not one can aim and handle a machine gun properly
oh i may know why perhaps their having the same aim issues as you are
then you hear  well  sev took one out  send him
oh wow
you get pinned down by a helgahn push to take back a square you took over and not one damned individual brought say a rocket launcher of some kind
never heard of squad weapons i guess
useless
youll be fending off hoards of lead and grenades only to be flanked as if you were a one man army when theres about  others around you doing nothing but dyingoh and after giving you such terrible covering fire they expect you to leap to them because they got wounded
thats even betterwhat was  stars was the graphics
spot on
really great
the environment the feel of the war around you the design of the armor and various machines you fight   stars
the sound could have been better especially with the weapons effects but the whole package graphically and visually was great
something your money should expect in next generation gamesthe controls are awful
it made me wish i had a mouse and all of the aiming issues would have dissapeared
whether some say its sluggish top heavy clunky  the fact that your weapon not only goes off because of kickback issues the only decent gun that halfway aids you in aimingsucks
you run out of ammo real quick and then your forced to use the crappy helgan equipment with iron sights and accuracy problems not to mention the load time of some weapons
jeez
barrel type magazines that you have to breach load
my goodness
a dude with a knife and some speed will kill you before your able to pull back the slide  which will happen to you alot in this game
and where or where is our own smoke that you can use to hide your movements hmmm
i guess the idf army didnt think that was neededsorry folks its a pretty disaster in my opinion
i suppose multilayer is great but i dont buy console games to play online thats for the pcso i give this  starsthe thing is i dont like to give this game  stars because scifi games are hard to come by but its just how i see things in the endsorry sony you dropped a pretty and graphically awesome ballplaying killzone  there is no doubt whatsoever that the developers guerrilla games know what theyre doing
killzone  from a technical perspective is a masterpiece
the level of detail in the environments is very high the sound design is stellar and the lighting in particular is some of the very best ive seen in any game ever
the game performs admirably and on the surface seems to be quite a fantastic game but its when you play the game it is missing a very key component and that is character
killzone  just doesnt feel like it has any life to itthere is a story here with lore there are characters and there is a setting but none of it feels significant in any way
in fact it all feels instantly forgettable
and this is inexcusable when you have a game that functions such as killzone  does being a linear corridor shooter with very little variety to the gameplay
sure there is the occasional opportunity to pilot a vehicle which does well to break up the pace but this is ultimately a coverbased pop  shoot fps that offers very little more
a meaningful storyline with better writing could have worked wonders for this game as it did with other games with similar campaigns see call of duty  as a fine example of how to do this right but ultimately the essence of the game feels cold and distant
it feels like a game that exists simply because it canthe gameplay itself does have its moments of fun
sometimes the sheer technical scope of killzone s set pieces provides a setting for some enjoyable battles that are difficult to not marvel at
but even then the gameplay never feels quite as good as it should with an overbearing sense of weight and sluggishness that could have added a nice sense of realism had it not been so overdone
also the constant browntoned coloring of the planet helgen really starts to wear on you after a while making things feel even more dull than they already areit feels like guerilla games has a very good game in them that will be made at some point but killzone  isnt it
its a technical marvel that just feels lifeless and fails to do anything to distinguish itself from the horders of other first person shooters out thereim about halfway through the games single player but im not impressed
aiming is horrendous and although i cant quite put my finger on why its just incredibly difficult to aim at enemies
it always seems like the controls takes half a second to respond and when youre trying to make slight adjustments when looking down a gun sight it always moves too muchcrouching is also terrible
you must always hold down the crouch button if you want to crouch  you cant toggle it
to make matters worse you must hold up to peek out of cover and then you have to activate your sights if you want to use them
you must do this while holding the crouch button the entire time
brain deadthe real stinker though is the fact that you can only carry one weapon besides the terrible pistol which is your mandatory secondary firearm
so you must always use an assault rifle or smg type weapon because it is the only weapon that is usable in all situations
using a missile launcher is terrible because once you fire those three rockets you have no weapon other than the useless pistol
why are players not given an option to toss that useless pistol for a more useful weapon
did sony want realism yet they were okay with players healing from neardeath in  seconds
carrying only one useful weapon causes the gameplay to become staletheres just so many flaws in this game that i cant give it even  stars
yeah it looks nice but thats ithmmm the graphics are cool
but i hate playing a drunkin bum
this dude is drunk
i can aim better than this guy and he is in the military
lmaothis is the main reason this will not get  stars
and if this game is the best you ever played  lmao that is to funnyget out more because there are so many better gamesall these five star reviews seem to completely lack objectivity
everyone keeps saying its amazing and is the best zelda ever
this just isnt true
first of all amazing compared to what
gta final fantasy or shenmue
the game has midi music no live voices average graphics and an unrealistically small overworld with  street towns forests without any trees in your way
is this amazing compared to a whole state with three cities composed of dozens of blocs hundreds of people and vehicles like in gta san andreas
this game pales in video game standards compared to even shenmue i final fantasy x and gta  which came out  years before itfuthermore the game seems to ignore most of the progress the zelda franchise made since lttp
lttp had  dungeons  swords  shields  items and magic power with lots of spells
tp only has  dungeons  swords  shields  items and no magic at all
ocarina introduced integration of a musical instrument to the gameplay
this element is lacking in tp
majoras mask introduced very extensive gameplay before you enter the dungeon and extensive character interaction and sidequests
all of this is significantly scaled back in tp
also whereas in mm you could transform into three different forms that could hover roll or swim rapidly underwater in tp you only transform into a wolf that cant do much
wind waker introduced an overworld that was realistically large and integrated meaning it was all one piecenot a bunch of areas with load times between them
tp overworld is smaller than wws is fragmented into small areas and often doesnt match
for example if you look at hyrule castle from the ground the rooftops you scaled to reach zelda arent there
finally most zelda games had a unique featureability
mm had masks oracle games had seeds and rings minnish cap had kinship stones etc
tp has nothing like that
so how is it that a game that came out years after its predecessors on nintendos most powerful console yet actually regressed in amount of equipment number of dungeons overworld size etc
lttp made a huge leap over zelda ii and oot made a huge leap over lttp
these games were among defining for their time
tp made little progress over n games or wind waker and feels a generation behind contemporary games like final fantasy xii or gta san andreasthe story is strange too
you dont really learn anything about the legend of zeldahyrule
the story is all about midna and zant which is frustrating since tp was supposed to be the spiritual successor to the oot
also the weird cybernetic twilight world with floating square particles wormholes and zants castle that looks like inside of a computer really clashes with zeldas medieval theme
other than the postman from majoras mask there are no characters from other zelda games no fairy fountains no pissed off chickens no magic nothing recognizeable really
so it just doesnt have much zelda charm
ww was a tropic island adventury with cartoony graphics but with recognizable zelda elements a new chapter to the hyrule legend and strong interaction between link zelda and ganondorf it felt like a zelda much more than this onealso there is little innovation here
other than the horseback combat system which was awesome nothing here is really new
also collecting three things and then collecting five more things is getting pretty old by this point especially on a d system
cant nintendo come up with a more involving storylinefinally this all would have been okay if the game were really fun
but its not
for the first three dungeons you discover big new areas but the action is boring
as a wolf you run around deserted blackandwhite areas killing bugs
human action is a little better but theres little of it
soon after the third dungeon you dont go back and forth between twilight and light and you barely play as the wolf
also the action between dungeons becomes shorter and shorter
after fifth dungeon you dont discover any new places except one onestreet town and dont do anything except maybe a couple of really tedious fetch quests or repeats of the early quests
the dungeons themselves are okay
only walking on walls and ceiling in the goron mines and the enitre city in the sky felt above and beyond what weve seen before
otherwise theyre too straitforward and the puzzles too simple
also the design isnt very crisp and their theme interaction with fire water etc isnt developed as well as before
the fire dungeon is a weird combination of mechanical mines caves and docks and the water dungeon has only slightly more water in it than the fire dungeon
the temple of time is a complete rip off of the wind wakers tower of gods
the minibosses and the bosses in this game are the best of any zelda games although too easy and they still just wait for link to hit themso overall for me the game was a disappointment
and before people discard my opinion because i dont love the game and write how i must be an xbox or ps fan or that i havent actually played this game know that i dont even own these systems and that i played almost every zelda game including this one  times
however i find it frustrating that whereas zelda games were among the most cuttingedge on the market in the s nintendo has not only fallen this far behind the industry standards for rpgadventure games but it has fallen the standars set by its own games many years agothis game just feels like a chore
little reward in the actual story
the game is also a bit too dark
depresses mei got maybe  hours in and just said screw it
maybe ill finish it one day maybe notwii controls were ok nothing groundbreaking
graphics were a bit bad for wiioverall the game graphics are good and worthwhile to spend your free time challenging yourselfwhat really annoys me are instances in the game where when you die and restart at a checkpoint you start off without having the necessary tools or resources to move on
near the start of the game for example when you are chasing a monkey that the kids are going after
in order to catch the monkey you need the horse to jump over a gate
when i was killed at a point beyond the gate i started at a checkpoint where i had no horse and there was that same gate in front of me
well i looked around for the horse but found nothing
so i figured the horse must have ended up somewhere beyond the gateso i quit after not finding the horse to go over the obstacle
you may encounter similar glitches throughout several points in the game
its not much of a game when you cant move over obstacles not because it is challenging but because you are unable tookay so i bought a wii and zelda was the musthave launch title right
wrong
to those who are crazy in love with this game they are welcome to it
to all others i say dont believe the hype
first theres the wii control scheme
in the product description it saysthis new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous nintendo hardware
for example waving the remote in the air will result in link performing the same move with the sword
to fire off on arrow players pull back on a virtual controller string as the wii remotes speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release
okay waving the sword does not make link do the same move
thats not even possible without the wii motion plus
and pulling back an arrow
since when
i never had to pull back on anythingthis is obviously a gamecube port
the wii controls are tacked on
thats okay though because i love the gamecube
but forget the controls
what about the actual gameplaythis game is very linear
and it holds your hand for far too long
i found that  hours into the game i was still being tutored  for no reason
youll feel like one of the goats you get to herd in the game
oh yes the goat herding you are link the awesome chosen hero
who fights evil by herding goatsand that brings me to something else that drives me nuts about these newer zelda games
why is it that you have to spend hours doing stupid menial tasks at the beginning of the game
its a definite turnoff to any new player
i persevered hoping it would get better
but after chasing monkeys and running from bees and finding a lost cat and reading dumb cut scenes involving a bunch of whiny kids i kept thinking for gods sake just give me a dang sword and let me get on with it already
its like nintendo punishes you for wanting to fight by making you do a bunch of stupid stuff beforehandplease nintendo learn something here
give people a sword at the beginning
throw them in the action and let them figure it out as they go
i mean lets face it the story always boils down to collect all pieces of whatever in the dungeons and killing gannon
why make this complicated
what else is there to understandbut its not all bad
the graphics were wonderful
more along the lines of ocarina of time and definitely an improvement over the windwaker
but too bad twilight princesss realistic landscape was completely populated by ridiculous annoying cartoony charactersi also liked the music particularly during some of god scenes
very well donethe use of the portals was very good
definitely an improvement over windwaker where you used to set your sail then leave the room for an hour while you waited to finally get there
i was thankful for thatand ive got to say the wolf concept was awesome
playing as the wolf is one of the coolest things you get to do in the game
i really enjoyed that part
its too bad it is tainted somewhat by that stupid midget riding on your backwhich brings me to one of the worst things in the game midna
never has a sidekick ever been so annoying
do you like to be mocked and told what to do all the time
and her pseudojapanese babytalk voice was awful
that got really obnoxious after a while
why does link need a sidekick anyway
cant he just figure stuff out on his own like in the original nes legend of zeldathe dungeons were fun
well designed but a little too linear
you dont really have any choice in how you beat them
theres pretty much one path to take and once youve figured it out thats itthe gameplay was a major step back
or a step down if you will
the enemies were the worst
they were complete pushovers
in other games like windwaker or metroid prime you get a sense of dread when a giant enemy fills the whole room and towers over you
not in this game
here you can just laugh at them because you already know that you are going to beat them without dying once
i couldnt believe how easy it was
at first i thought it was annoying that it took  pieces of heart to make a heart container instead of  seemed like a lot of work
but in retrospect why bother anyway
youll never need more than about  hearts to beat the toughest bosslast night i finally realized that ive had it with this game
i had spent over an hour  an hour
 literally searching for an ant
at that point i realized that i did not want to waste any more time on stupid sidequests and minigames
im already over  hours into the game and im wondering if it is ever going to end
i think ive got  dungeons left to go
but right now im not so sure that i can summon the will to continue
this game has a way of sucking the life out of you
but i am a power player so i shall enduregoodgraphicsmusicplaying as a wolfbadmost obnoxious annoying sidekick evergoat herdingsumo wrestling has our hero really been reduced to this
menial tasksboring cutscenessmall world to explore compared to other gamesenemies are a total pushoveri wish i could recommend it but i just cant
sorry all you twilight princess lovers
i hope the big n does better on the next offeringthis game has so much potential to be great but it pulls itself down with silly old video game concepts
it does so many things well the pacing is awesome the player is constantly hooked and there are lots of creative ideas but then its punctuated with instances where youll just want to put a hole in the wallits as if the development team was working on the game highfiving each other for their great ideas everyones having a good time when an executive comes in and says you know what
we need to make the player work harder
you need to make this boss battle last  minutes i know the player has been shooting and killing stuff this whole time but this boss is invulnerable and the player has to figure out our little secret on how to hurt it and after  minutes of button mashing the boss will use his superpower and do quadruple the damage as a player do you like fighting a boss using repetitive methods for  minutes and then suddenly be killed because the boss forgot to use its megapower earlier
ok you can memorize the patterns and the next time it happens youll be ready for it except now there is another new pattern you have to figure out
ok so you memorized this new pattern and now youre ready again i bet you feel real smart for memorizing the developers patterns dont you
are you having fun now
no
because this is what developers could do and get away with in the s but its been two decades of video game growth since then
in the s when video games were zygotes the developer created a pattern which the player had to figure out once the player figured out the pattern the dev would make a new pattern and the player would figure it out and master it again
this method quickly becomes repetitive but when video game technology was in its infancy and designed to eat up quarters at arcades the developers could get away with it
but now everyone has a cell phone the soviet union is no moreyou knowthings change
today the developers ask themselves what would be fun for the player what can we do to make it challenging without loosing its fun and how do we constantly innovate
retro studios fulfills half of that and then shoots itself in the foot
for every great idea they have they balance it with a bad idea
i was hooked on this game from the start
you begin in the cockpit of samuss ship even though you dont get to fly it you can manipulate the ship and explore the interior
its immersive
the puzzles are fun the controls work well although the menu system is clunky the combat is fluid and smooth even though the wiimote is fidgety the narrative is just good enough to push the action along and then youll get stuck and cant figure out where to go
youll back track and exhaust all ideas and then look for an online guide and then find out that you have to bomb out an obscure part of a wall to gain access to a tunnel
sometimes youll run around a room and cant figure out where to go and after  minutes youll realize that there is a muddy looking ledge that is semi hidden in the shadows
the art design is superb but this game really needs a hd upgrade for better resolution shadows and texturesdespite all these flaws its still fun enough to keep enduring the painuntil you run out places to put a hole in your wall and then you have no wall left to put a hole into and you just cant go on anymore
if you have enough space on your wall however youre in for a real treat
this game can rival the best of todays franchise titans such as god of war halo call of duty and mass effecti was looking for a dumb shooter just for playing and killing time on the weekend mornings
nothing wrong with the game it just takes a lot of skill to play and i just dont have the time to devotate to it
great game if you are looking for a tough shooting stratagy gamethis is goodup until they want you to do item searching
picture this youre ready to face the final boss then you are told you need to back track to all the levels to find items
yay
you have no idea where the items are and can only go to unexplored areas
i find this kind of task in games tedious and boring
yep i returned it after hours of hunting and pecking for power cubesbeing a big fan of the original metroid on the nes and after reading all the reviews of the game i had high hopes for this title
unfortunately i was sorely disappointed
this game could have been great but the technical issues and poor control scheme and ui made it nearly unplayable at which point i completely lost interest in the game
i still finished it because i wanted to see what happens but it felt more like a chore than a game
overall i give this a 
read on for detailsgraphicssamus the ship the monsters the cutscenes and the environments are all beautiful to behold but the poor lighting and confusing color scheme made it nearly impossible to navigate some areas
paths around corners were way too easy to miss because the walls all blended into each other
due to the lack of shading in the graphics engine i spent way too much time muttering theres supposed to be a path here somewhere than actually going from room to room
nevertheless despite this shortcoming the graphics themselves are excellent
i give it a  for graphicsmusic  soundthe music was very well done
it was subtle and you wont recognize many of the themes but they added real atmosphere
like a great movie soundtrack you dont really notice it while youre there and only really appreciate it in retrospect
the sound effects were all appropriate with lovely explosions and beam noises and stereo effects
i find no faults with music nor sound
controlsthis is where the game really starts to fall apart
with the lack of a calibration system you cant just point your wiimote at the screen and expect it to aim where you want you have to be able to see the cursor
unfortunately with all thats going on you can rarely see it so half the time you have no idea where youre aiming
the ztargeting if anything makes it more difficult to aim
when you go tofrom the ball it often shifts your perspective around
this is extremely inconvenient when navigating in tight situations where theres no room for the camera
i never got used to the three different helmets in the game and i was always going into the wrong helmet for various tasks
i give it points for the space boost and the screw attack control scheme  that part worked pretty well
overall though the controls were frustrating at best
gameplaymetroid should be fun
this was not fun
going from place to place took forever because doors wouldnt open when you want them to due to a longstanding bug  they have to load the adjacent zone before the door will open
looking up things in the menu system was incredibly frustrating and the fetch quest at the end was contrived and pointless
the plot was uninteresting and convoluted and about halfway through the game i no longer cared why i was performing these tasks  not that i could follow it anyway
the d map system is horrible
its nearly impossible to read and using it is often more confusing than just looking around the room youre in
between the poor load times the frustrating control scheme the monsters that just kept coming back over and over again didnt i just kill you
what the the incredibly lengthy boss battles and any number of things that robbed the game of any funfactor it had at the beginning i cant give this game more than a  for the gameplayreplayabilityeven if this game were replayable i wouldnt want to
when you finish the game it does allow you to go back and play it in hyper difficulty mode but why would you want to do that
 hours of frustration later and you want to leap back into it
i think noti was looking for a good racing game for the wii
all over the web it seems that this one is most highly praised
this review is for someone looking for a racing game where the vehicles behave even somewhat realistically
the cover of the box reminded me of xevo and xevo which are games i played on a pc with steering wheel control about  years ago
i really like those games and was hoping this was similarthis game does allow you to racethat is true
it can also be a lot of fun
the problem is this
i cant begin to tell you what you are racing
maybe if we called it a hovercraft or a jet truck or a spaceshiptruck hybrid it might help
any resemblance to the way a real truck or any real world vehicle for that matter behaves seems to be out of the question with this game
the graphics are good and scenery is very realistic
that is when you can see it
the trucks move at an impossible pace
they have turbo boost and when you play against the computer trucks you will find that if you do not use your turbo boost to the maximum you will not keep up
this causes the truck to move at relative speed of what seems to be  miles an hour through what is usually woods
almost nothing stops the truck as far as terrain or turns in the road
trees will stop you
trees will always stop you
any tree you hit will make the truck crash and cause you to wait until you can resume
now on to the flying part
if you really compete with the computer trucks you spend anywhere from  to  of the time in the air
you can control staying in the air longer or shorter hhmmmmm what is the physics of that
you can steer in the air
you can land after being  yards in the air and just keep on going as though that would not cause any damage but dont hit that treeyou will stop dead in your tracksthis is definitely a very fun jet cartruck flying amphibious hovercraft spaceship racing game
no realism to speak ofok i admit im not a big fan of racing games
i liked burnout  on the xbox but that was mostly because of its crash mode
how much fun can you have driving in circles over and over again
yeah the courses change and there is the competition aspect but really in the end you are just sitting there holding down the accelerator button and tilting the controller
theres no real strategy suspense or thinking
oh and the physics are weak
explain to me how a car can turn in mid air with no wheels touching the ground
this may be fun for parties for about  minutes at mostlisten to me
dont buy this game
if someone wants to give it you refuse it
seriously i paid  for this pathetic excuse for a third person shooter
i was bored after the first  minutes
no real storyline just the repetitive action of shooting bad guys who somehow can shoot you while you are standing behind walls
also grenades can damage you even if youre nowhere near the explosion
the graphics werent bad expecially the jungle scenes
thats why i rated this game with  stars instead of one
i like third person shooters and was hoping this would be one of those games like rogue trooper which was very goodsave your money but if you feel the need to blow  bucks then take the money and flush it down the toilet
youll get just as much satisfactioni bought this game a few days ago
i had read reviews which stated the game was the best and had won many accolades
so i expected a game which deserved that title
before i had played this game i had played bioshock halo  which i didnt like and traded for fear fear and the orange box on the xbox my first feeling when seeing the landscape for this game is that this is the drabbiest game i have yet to play
everything is muted with a strong emphasis on grey
even the water is ashen
it doesnt help when you attempting to distinguish friend from foe when youre in a combat situation
there were times when i committed friendly firethen my second feeling when playing the game is that there is little or no story
very little is explained other than that there is a war between  two species and the character i played was a former soldier tried by his peers in a public trial
like the halo series if i needed to know more i had to go outside the game and obtain written material
i dont like this approach
the game should tell me what i need to know
this is a game of connecting the dots  do a go to bafter playing the different weapons i must say that these are some of the worst weapons i have yet to play
there are two i have in mind  the sniper rifle and the torque bow
both fire one shot before needing reload
and in the case of the sniper rifle they appear to do minimum damage
in one instance i shot an enemy ai while he was standing still three times directly in the head before he expired
mine you this enemy had no helmetthat leads to the next area of issue for me  the ai
there is a character named dom
throughout the game dom is usually paired with marcus fenix the character you play
i see him as gears equivalent of alyx vince from halflife  unfortunately the similarity ends there
dom unlike alyx has a very bad habit of dieing far too easily
this complicates matters further on in the game especially in the final boss battlethe final boss battle is where the game lost me
after repeatedly attempting to whack the enemy i became frustrated with the game and quit the gears of war
when i was faced with dom dieing constantly which resulted in the villain quickening his pace or the constant delay in reloading the torque bow or the fact that i was limited by where i could travel before being set upon by bats with glowing yellow eyes or that i needed to constantly pump the lancer into the villain the game grew increasingly frustrating
finally after an hour i said enoughi admit it i believed the hype
i was pretty sure gears of war would be a fun game
i stand corrected
first of all ill start with the controls
i could argue a fps is only as good as its controls
and if thats the case gears of war is bad
precision in the controls is very lacking
whether thats the xbox controllers fault or the games fault i dont know but its not good
i can easily name three ps fpss that have much better shooting controls  timesplitters future perfect urban riot response and resident evil graphics  nothing but hype
sure duh the graphics are going to look better than an original xbox or a ps
does that mean theyre mindblowing artistic or better than typical modern pc games like say call of duty  or far cry
hell to the no
for one thing the color is well there is no color
just look at the screenshots
they might as well have just painted the whole game gray
it looks terrible
if thats good graphics ill pass on good graphics thank you very much
dead rising has better graphics but its not getting hyped for itgameplay  not good not good
the cover idea is just a cheap silly gimmick a selling point
ive been using cover flanking popouts proning sprinting etc
for years with the call of duty series
im not impressed at all
weapons
nothing special
painkiller for pc has tons of more fun and innovative weaponsstory
well i wasnt expecting an rpg or anything but this feels like starting to watch a movie in the middle of it
story isnt terribly important in a fps but it wouldnt hurt to make the player care about the characters or their missioni would take so many fpss over gears of war
i dont care how many people say its great or how many great reviews it gets
hype hype hype
i would say graphics dont make a great game but considering the graphics arent that great ill just say hype doesnt make a great gamegears of war  is highly overrated the first  missions in the game are decent but nothing special
but overall not bad considering its the first of the series and as series evolve many get better
but w this game its weird because its like they had  design team do the first  missions and then they left or got fired
then epic walked around the building and found the janitor who has no design experience and told him to finish the game
and to make matters worse they refused to show him how the rest of the game was done and just gave him a list of characters they wanted addedthe train missionmission  is heavily glitch filled ive seen raam take the insanity level damage when the game is in casual difficulty and casual level damage when the game is in insanity difficulty
the storyline goes off the tracks and makes no sense in this mission
everything you leaned up this point in how the game is played is turned on its head
the combat system which has some deficiencies but are hidden up until this point by the mission layout
become glaringly obvious on mission if your into a game more for the campaign look elsewhere even if mission  was cool the campaign was like hrs on causal and maybe hrs on the harder difficulty levels
and theres not much of a reason to play again as there is no upgrades or new weapon you can get
as for online play its a coop and that can be cool but that still revolves around a flawed campaign
for the multiplayer i couldnt say if its good or not because thats really not my thingi had a lot of fun playing this game  i thought how great it was that there wasnt a boss in that you had to shoot billion times to kill because its so lame to do that
but then i came across raam and having to kill that guy and the game designers reverted
thats too bad this was a  star game until then
but killing raam and the number of times you have to just shoot him over and over and over and over  ranks right up there with using a butter knife to chop down a giant redwood tree  sure you can do it over time but in the end theres no fun or satisfaction only the realization of the time you wasted just trying to shoot the same guy over and over
its almost as though they had one set of game designers for everything but the raam level then swapped out for idiots to design the raam levelfirst im not a fanboy
i own a   games an original xbox  games games and a ps  games
i had always gamed on my computer but purchased a ps so i could play gtavice city then about a year after that got my xbox and then this summer my  purchased so that i could play saints row
i like all kinds of games and i have most of the major releases for all  platforms for about the last  years
i also will admit for a few of my most favorite games i will buy other versions to get other content etc i own all  platforms of godfather the game lol
i do want to get a ps when they are more widely available probably will wait till the summer like i did for the  plus there will be more games for it then im sure
with my boring background out of the way heres my reviewlast week i picked up a bunch of new games for my gears of war was the first one i tried out
ok well i wasnt that impressed
visuals were pretty good but it seemed like the coupleofhumanstrappedin a small areaby huge alienstype story like alien or things like that
i dont like the fact you cant control your crouchingwall cover more although i guess with time i could get used to the movements
one thing i noticed everyone else say was hey you cant jumpmyself i think they made it like that on purposeif a human soldier was carrying all that equipment in real life it would be at least lbs of packweaponsarmor obviously he wouldnt be able to jump very high lol
in fact quite honestly i always thought the fact you could jump like a jumping bean in halo with that armorenviro suit on was kind of silly but thats just me i guessanyway maybe part of the problem is its me ie
im not too good at this type of shooter ie
the quakedoomunreal type game rather than the gtasaints rowgodfathe type game
it was frustrating to be stuck in the same place where the enemy species is cutting through that door and even though im taking cover etc being killed in like  to  seconds
the weapons you have at this stage dont seem to do too much damage to the enemy either or maybe im not hitting them in the right places
i read somewhere take their knees out first becuase their thorax is heavily armored tried that still got killed
maybe once i got the machine gun with the saw bayonet id score more kills i dont know
to me right now this game seems too frustratingthe enemies are too strong and the weapons are too weak
again this could just be my poor skills just my opinion but i dont think im going to spend too much time on this onei got through about half of the campaign and had to give up because there were several levels that were just too hard even in easynormal mode
the gameplay was pretty fun overall but frustrating at times and when i start getting too frustrated to enjoy a game i just turn it off and move on to something else
this game was like that very cool in that i wanted it to be a better game but that wasnt happeningthis game had some potential but it dies after a few hours of play because of things that should not be
it has a decent story and if you like an old style rpg it starts out feeling ok  but it soon deteriorates it is turn based combat
now i am an old fallout fan so i like a good turn based combat game but this combat system is pretty dull
you have no control over your character
everyone stands around and takes their shots
last man standing wins
no using cover no combo creations you can create etc the spell system is not intuitive at all
indeed i played the first  hours without understanding how to make or cast a spell because i could not figure it out and the game guide for the us version is horrid
after haste spell was used against me in combat i decided there was at least one spell worth knowing so i went online to get instructions at first random battles are ok to have but after a while you get tired of them
there is a level up issue too
as you level up killing known monster types does not get easier because they level up with you
if you level up too much in the early game beacuse you are fighting all the battles then you end up in an impossible situation because you cannot win any more battles
your opponents are the same level as you but they have great spells and armor and weapons and skill points and you do not because you have not made it to that part of the game yet where this stuff is available so you loose
indeeed the advice online is not to fight any battles yes do not fight any random encounters in the begining and concentrate on quests as your level up scheme or else you will fall into this trap
gee
what kind of fighting rpg game has players recommending not fighting graphics look good in the adds but it is deceptive
they are not that great for most of the game areas there is no map system i can see so you cannot figure out where to go for stuff and you have no control over camera angle
both these are very anoyying
of course if you cannot move around during battle then why bother with camera angle ehit might have been a good game when it first came out but it is not worth the time you will put into it now when you have other choices like the witcher at your disposalhail flaviusin the first mission you friggin backtrack through the exact same area like  times for no good reason
that should tell you how much time they spent on this one
in the storm you go through the base and blow up stuff
then in floodgate you go back through the same level and kill the flood
frickin lazy bungie
frickin lazy
metroid does backtracing right
give me a new power to change the situation
nope its just all right trigger madness like all halo gamesi just reviewed reach so i figured why not put my two cents in on this oneif by some chance you have been stuck in a bomb shelter for the past few years and missed this one and youre in the market for a  halo game get reach instead  it aint perfect either but its the best of the bunch
at the very least wait it out and get the hd remake of the original game  youll get the security of having a brand new multiplayerhalo  is a half baked game
you can clear out the craptastic campaign in a few hours and reach mp is better developedhalo  odst is better believe it or not but if you must skip that one too and just get reachthe game is ok like most others i dont believe it lives up to the hype if you like playing the campaign get it to see how it ends but if you are getting it for multiplayer save your money and keep playing halo the graphics look pretty much the same as halo  even in hd keeping it short i wouldnt reccomend this game just keep playing i was a big fan of the halo series very big fan i remember when i first bought the game it was amazing to me until i went online and played xbox livei dont know what bungie was thinking when they made this point system nonsense and the lag and unfairness of this system really makes me think that halo  was created by a bunch of lazy pigs  bungie  i play call of duty  everyday now  i put down halo  cause i should have fun playing games not getting stressed all of the time
by far cod  is much more entertaining than halo   besides the graphics in halo  are sub par and represents laziness on the part of bungie
i might sell my copy for about  bucksas a veteran of the old wolfenstein first d first person shooter i have been gaming for a while
halo  is a disappointment for a number of different reasons
lets begin the campaign is awesome unless your fighting limitless amount of zombies
which you end up doing about  of the time
having said that the campaign is not awesome
it gets very repetitive and just out right boring having to shoot the same twisted looking dudes running at you over and over againit is also just too short halo s campaign kept you interested while halo s  makes you never want to play it again
the multiplayer i am not really sure why people play this game to be honest
its just down right aweful
the team play has absolutely zero strategy which typically results in half of your team mates running to get the overshield or the shotgun and when you get it first you typically are betrayed killed by your team mate so he take your recently acquired goodiesalso if you are an adult the constant barrage of  year olds talking smack or making obscene noises andor tea bagging you after they kill you will get old very quickly
you simply cannot play one night without running into one of these idiotsthe last bug in halo  is the horrible game play on the multiplayer
i dont know how many times i have shot someone point blank to the face with a shot gun only to be beaten down
or on two occasions when viewing the games in theater bullets that completely miss my body andor head that still result in a instant kill or the bullet shooting  degrees out of the sniper rifle into my head
that was my favoritehowever what i do like about halo  is bungies website
they catalogue all your medals your recent game scores and diagrams of your kills on the maps your rank and how much more skill you need to rank up your screen shots your theater movies
all of that is pretty cool and is a sort of collection to your time on halo personally the major thing that keeps me playing call of duty  is major amount of idiots that play halo  after am
if you are an adult play cod  if you are under  play halo loved halo  and would still play it if i still had my xbox
im talking primarily about the single player campaign
something interesting i found in halo  was bigger environments to explore
problem was with a better ai in place while i was off exploring they were out there doing all the dirty work
by the time i had my fill in exploration all the enemies were dead ummmm
that is not fun at all and this was on heroic settingso what i tried to do was take out all my allies so i could do all the battling
and guess what
when you try picking off your own men the game practically cuts to a cgi sequence in which you are outnumbered by your own forces who decimate you just short or dropping an atomic bomb on master cheif
i actually stopped playing the game at this point and will not give it any more chances
its not gonna get betterhalo  was a good sequal because it took most things of halo  to the next level ie online gameplayhalo  is loaded with unecessary pickups and accessories and it feels like a kids playset see gears  for same problem
this is always the start of stupidity
it makes you feel like you are playing with dollstoys as opposed to the sublime space mission the first game was
it feels so cheap
it feels like buying a heman doll that comes with a sword and axe in the plastic package and you can switch them out
you could buy a heman weapon playset that includes spiked club mage staff and as a goof an umbrella etc
all of which will fit perfectly in hemans empty molded fist
this is such a cheap massproduced feeling and halo  is an example where a mold is cast in which developers will try and milk you for as much as possiblethere are no suprises in this game
its lazy developers looking to make more money on what was once a good franchise
there are just not enough improvements in this game for me to recommend it to anyone
download halo  on your  if youve never played a halo game before
its a better game and the graphics surprisingly have not improved through the years eitherlet see run jump shoot that pretty much describes the gamedidnt do a thing for me i tryed itit just didnt rock my boatthe first halo was amazing the second halo was good and now halo  halo  is way too overhyped in my opinion its not really any different than halo  you can use new items and thats about it
the graphics are pretty good but definetely not the best
if you were unimpressed by the lack of innovation in halo  youll be even more disappointed in hi played this game in the store on base for about an hour or sowhat a letdown
i knew there was noway it could live up to the hype but this game is bland boring and the graphix could be found on a ps
the gunz feel like you are shooting a bb gun
save your  for codnothin new here just slightly better graphics but its the same old stuff here no new enemies samt brutes same flood and covenant screw this game there are way better games on the market than halo i bought halo with my xbox  and i wish i had gotten a different game i have it sitin there it been weeks since ive played it
go waiste your money on something els people or just save it up for metal gear solid  buy problably is another piece of crap they are makin crappy games latelyi played halo and loved it
i played halo  and kind of enjoyed it
i skipped halo  and went right to halo odst and enjoyed that
now i finally came back to halo  and all i have to say is what a snoozefest
i was dismayed at the boring levels that frequently gave no indication as to where you needed to go
i was perplexed by the who cares
plot line that seemed to only be created in order to make further use of the flood which are really annoying as far as video game zombies are concerned
i only finished the game so that i could get it over with and learn how the trilogy of games concludes as each level of halo  was less and less compelling than the previous one and some of the flood levels were downright incomprehensible as to where to go and what to do
to be sure i liked odst and play the firefight mode with friends all the time
but this game is about as exciting as pariah was for the old xbox
fair warningto be blunt this game sucks balls
the weapons are awful and the graphics are ok the worst part of the game is you cant run and the sights on the guns lack any control
the campain was fun for the first few hours after that its all the same and gets boring fast
if you want a good game go with call of duty 
i havnt put it down since i got itif you a hardcore halo  fan like i am am you will not enjoy this
most of the reviews are right saying that this game is geared for online play
i was blown away by halo  and i still play it
all the halos are good i guess for playing with your friends and talking smack ofterwards i guess but they have changed the game so much from halo  gameplay that they should have gave it a different name
all in all i bought this gamebeat it on the hardest setting and sold it
not worth it in my opinion
the graphics are the same if not worse then the previous halos
so i dont see why they didnt put it out on regular xbox too
thanks for readingso i played halo  multiplayer like it was crack damn good crack at that
loved it couldnt get bored or enough of it chasing my dragon of h multiplayer
halo  let alone the series was never known for its single player campaign so didnt expect much out of its sucessor so i was surprised when the single player was worse than i expected
story wasnt too good ending left me kinda confused  kinda frustrated i just spent hours of my life on this
no worries right
i bought it for multiplayer but no i found myself in deja vu
did i mistakenly buy halo  again and just not realize it
i must have otherwise it would be much betterthe forge is cool for sure the graphics are kinda better i have hd so dont tell me i didnt fully experience it look at geow cod mass effect asassins creed bioshock the list goes on and then try to tell me why halo  is even made for a next gen console
the multiplayer is a smoother interface overall no doubt the weapon balance is tweaked for the better im so glad they brough back the assault rifle but they effed it up and made it as powerful as a supersoaker and the deployable weapons are fun but its just halo  the way it should have been the first time if it wasnt rushed
so you say why mess with a good thing
well if youre not going to mess with it why are you making a sequel
oh thats right you just want my  and to make me never buy a game from you again
congratulations youve succeeded
for shame bungie serves you right for partnering with mseriously though i think the overhype kinda killed it for me too
i mean halo cereal
honestly
halo is a well established trademark so of course they arent going to mess with the basic gameplay and risk upsetting the core halo fans
i understand that this was mainly just to keep the fans playing for years to come and i would have been one of them if it was done even slightly better and maybe with a little more class
can you honestly make a game with so many fans that has a storyline no one will really get unless you read the books as well
apparently soall the improvements to multiplayer still dont make up for the lag the little green lights that lie to you and say everythings ok when it lags even more and the small maps oriented towards cheating ffa year olds
if they were shooting for the lowest common denominator they are dead on
the forge theater etc
shouldnt have taken  years to implement let alone require a new game
so whats that mean
bungiemicrosoft give us mediocrocy at best probably know it too take our money and then gloat about itbottom line i dont think ive ever been as excited for a great sequel and been as sorely dissapointed as i have been from thisof course everyone knew that this game would not live up to the extreme hypethats a given
i played halo  and  and liked them pretty well but ws never a fanatic or anythingi like shooters but am not that skilled at them i prefer the free roam type games like gta saints row etc rather than traditional fps which after all is what the halo games arei usually pick up all the major releases for  i figure that if i really dont like a game i can trade the premium titles in for a good exchange anyway i usually try to play through the game at least once to see how the story goes if the multiplayer is good i might keep it for a longer time
my favorite games of course i hang on to
i got this a few days after it came out
the graphics are oklike most  games the cut scenes are better rendered than the game play but the graphics are still quite good
the weapons from what i remember are similar to the first  games the controls are the same which is goodim playing on normal level and still die quite a bit again im not good at shooters
once there are brutes around im dead
the things that giggle at you are annoying but pretty easy to kill
i know its blasphemy in some circles but to me this is a fair game nothing too bad but not earthshaking either
i think gears of war was betterand that game although very good didnt live up the the hype either to be fair i dont think any game canbottom line if you liked halo  and  you will like this
if youre not much for shooters a it will be hard and b it may not impress you
also i would not buy a  just to play this
gta iv yes
this nographics are great
ive only played a few hours appears gameplay similar too if not exact to halo   same weapons same enemies over and over againgripehow lame not being able to hide and duck behind cover like you can in gears of war or ghost reocon
last i checked this was  not many people liked this game
i myself didnt see the attraction
i thought the graphics were average at best
probably should have been put out on ps for better graphics
that said if you are a big st person shooter fan which im not then you should be satisfied with this game because it did have a fair amount of actionthis halo game is not near as much fun as halo  or  the campaign isnt even a challenge and the online aint to fun either
this game isnt worth what you have to pay for it
just get halo reach insteadhalo i have trouble knowing where it is im supposed to begin with this game other than to say it is the greatest letdown of my gaming career
now to start off i am in no way a halo hater
in fact i have been a fan ever since the original game was released on the pc i have since acquired a xbox  and the original xbox version of that game and its sequel
in fact i was so excited by the hype of the third game that i went ahead and preordered the  legendary edition of the game
the result of when i finally got the game was that never again do i ever plan to preorder a game or pay topdollar for a collectors edition of a game unless its in a bargain bin a year or two later in fact that did happen to the halo  legendary edition saw it for  somewhere and shall never forgive myself for my wasted let me break this game down a bitgraphics  theyre good i suppose but didnt microsoft promise us that this game was practically the reason the  was created
this games graphics are nothing special in this day and age
while the first one was good for its time and the second was great for its time of release this games graphics wouldnt rank in the top  list of best  game graphics not by a long shot
often it feels rushed as if microsoft pushed bungie into finishing this sequel as fast as humanly possiblecharacter designs the new character designs also are pretty bad
for starters all characters seem to have taken steroid injections because whether its the elites or humans they have all seriously bulked up
theyve also become shorter and just seem very awkward in comparison to the designs of the first two games
i just was not convinced that many of the covenant species were even capable of walking in this gamelook  the entire game seems to have been put through a shiny filter that makes everything reflect colors at the same rate as a mirror even plant life
wasnt this game supposed to be the most realistic halo yet
i remember bungie officials and various magazine articles telling me that but when was the last time you walked into a forest and it shined at you
you could say this is water but unless there is a thin layer of water coating each and every leaf which is unbelievable in of itself than everything seems to be polished
now this isnt just the forest but every character and every location of this entire game
weapons characters plants shields ships and buildings everything shines like wellpolished silverstory  this plot of halo  is so simple im sure the officials at bungie must have spent  minutes on it
looking back on it i know that halo  suffered in this department as well but halo  you instantly take note of how poor the story is
the cut scenes were probably the best parts of both the previous games but here they become exercises in repetition and clicheacute
everything is overblown and none of it is ever believable
they try often to make these scenes dramatic but apparently whoever had a sense of drama in the previous games cut scenes left the project because this games cut scenes are about as subtle as a sledgehammerlevels  many of the levels are nothing new other than the fact you now have more weapons in which to deal with your pesky foes
no new forms of enemies to face nothing really of interestai  every entry in the halo game series suffers from heavily scriptbased ai but this games ai is so simpleminded that once youve played through the game once on any of the difficulties youll know exactly how to get through it on any other difficulty setting
i swear if you play this game on easy and then play on legendary aside from the fact that enemies have higher hit points they will respond to you the exact same way as they do on the other settings and they will never surprise you
come on bungie over ten years ago with halflife valve proved that you could write ai that was capable of creating its own strategy
this is another example in my observation that this game was solely made for the multiplayer aspect and they didnt care about the singleplayer campaignweapons  much of this is the same but we add in the most annoying aspect of this game and that would be the powerups
what were they thinking when they put these in campaign mode
i could understand silly powerups being in say the multiplayer but how do they fit into the actual game
they are worthless addition and it shows that bungie rushed this game because they obviously belong in the multiplayer and not the actual game modemultiplayer  i suppose this is the only good part about this game but it feels like a simpleminded retread of other multiplayer games such as unreal tournamentlegendary edition aside from the collectible bust of the master chiefs head this is probably the most overprice item ive ever purchased
there is nothing really special about it and the special features contained within the dvds dont really give you much insight into the creation of the games
you get things like the cut scenes from the first two games which is kind of cool but honestly those scenes feel very hollow unless youre actually playing the gameso all and all halo  is an alright multiplayer game but the story is awful the graphics are subpar considering weve seen such games as halflife gears of war and call of duty  display far superior improvements in the field
all and all the game is a rushed product that doesnt have any of the quality control that was displayed in the previous gamestheres no need to discuss the hype behind this game or its commercial success
we all know it was well received by the public got great reviews and made rockstar even richerso how does it play
was it worth the wait
should it have waited even longer
maybe and absolutelythe game does an admirable job of representing what is basically new york and having a sympathetic lead who kills steals and doublecrosses to survive
he doesnt like what he does wishes he didnt have to do it but in order to fulfill his objective he has to do these things
note that the vast majority of people he kills steals from and doublecrosses arent even worthy of being called scum
the game also forces the player to make some hard choices which have longlasting consequences
and of course true to form for a gta game theres weapons explosions sex car chases gun fights and profanities aplentywhich leads me to the first of many letdowns for this game
the missions are so repetitive so tedious so monotonous and so boring that it is literally impossible to truly differentiate one mission from the next
a good  of the game probably more involves shooting endless waves of enemies many of whom pop up in completely illogical places
it is very easy for one enemy to kill you in a matter of seconds after having done so well up to that pointwhich brings me to my next point mission failures
the system rockstar put in place is by far the worst system in any aaa video game and budget titles would do well to stay far from this as well
if you fail a mission you must restart the mission entirely
from the beginning
every single time
it doesnt matter if the mission is a single chase a single shootout or if there is more than one part to it
the final mission has five parts to it
if something goes wrong you start back at the beginning and you have to redo the entire thing all over again
there are no midmission checkpoints
this is completely inexcusable
operation flashpoint came out in  so video games have had checkpoints in them for at least seven years now and probably longer than that
please dont put in a comment about how i forgot about how x game had them in x
i am not interested i am only using that particular game as an example
thats it
end of discussionand yet when you do restart you still lose everything you used in the mission
why is that
why should i have to replenish everything i lost on something that didnt actually happen
i cant think of any game that does this and i probably wouldnt want to play such a game mainly because i prefer games that are fun
is having to restock ammo and armor on a mission that didnt actually just happen fun
no
thats downtime and downtime isnt fun especially when its needless downtime
and rockstar isnt based in someones garage
this is a very large company with a huge budget so these amateurish design decisions are even more inexcusablespeaking of inexcusable design decisions that were antiquated long long ago lets discuss another aspect of gun fights
for some reason when niko is being shot at his default speed running or walking is the exact same speed as when nothing is going on
swat  came out almost nine years ago and that game had a dynamic speed change
in other words if shots were fired everyone sped up
not niko
no hell just wander around unless you actually hit the run button
which also makes him run just as fast as though nothing is going on
wouldnt someone who is trying to find cover so they dont get shot move faster than if they arent in danger
if youd like a more recent example of what rockstar should have done take a look at mass effectthe driving mechanics also have a much higher learning curve than what it needs to be especially with motorcycles and helicopters
why rockstar didnt take more time honing the controls and making them easier to pick up is anyones guess
same with ladders
i have a friend who will tap the y button until his thumb is ready to break and even still niko will not climb the ladder that is right in front of him
this is usually after swimming a ridiculous distance to it since the game doesnt allow the player to just suicide and spawn at the nearest hospital
no instead we have to swim ridiculously long distances
talk about fun huhwhich is about the same as can be said for multiplayer
you just walk or drive around the city
there is nothing to do
nothing
no activities no places to go nothing
there are some missions that can be done but if you just want to free roam with a friend in multiplayer thats all you get to do
a dropin dropout coop in the story mode wouldve been much much betteroh yeah the story
well what little there is isnt too bad when the game actually allows you to see it
most of the time its too busy bogging you down with those same repetitive missions i talked about earlier where it always goes the exact same way  a deal that shouldnt have any problems where niko is just there as insurance turns into a battle ground with lots and lots of enemies then just theyre all dead more spawn in the area that was just cleared then the fight leads to a carmotorcycle chase which leads to a police chase lather rinse repeat
almost all of the missions have this exact same format
the only things that change are the goons clothing and the set of lines niko yells out as he kills them not the actual lines themselves
so dont worry kids if you heard him say something in a mission he will say it again
and againand againand againand lastly for some reason even though games have been doing this for years gta iv still allows objects that obstruct your view of the player to remain opaque
every other high quality title i have ever seen that operates in rd person forces such obstructions to go transparentthe characters niko takes missions from andor befriends are your stock cardboard cutouts but lets face it no one plays a gta game for the character study
thats why we have thoseumwhatre those things called libraries have themoh well
anyway the dialogue is at times rather humorous especially when niko is hanging around brucie
i think weve all known a brucie at some point in our lives so to see niko indirectly poke fun at these guys is a treat
and as usual gta iv satirizes many aspects of society and popculture that are just begging for it
celebrities radiotalk show hosts gossip magazines plenty of entertainment venues and the masses that support them all get the healthy shot of parody that has been coming to them for yearswith a whole lot more polish midmission checkpoints and far less repetition gta iv would deserve the accolades and commercial success it has enjoyed as of late
as it stands however it is yet another proof that hype a big name label and commercial success do not always mean a great game
it is a good game but nothing moreso the last few grand theft auto games were great fun and rather shiny and colorful and while people whine and complain about wanting things grittier and more realistic you end up with thisgrand theft auto iv is undoubtedly the most realistic gta game ever
and its also one of the most boringeverything that can be said about it has already been said by hundreds of reviewers and spectacularly by that guy i keep mentioning in my reviews yahtzee of the escapist magazineon the good side the game indeed looks very real and has some amazing ragdoll physics and the likethe bad side is extreme in comparison
your character is a generic eastern european refugee whose life consists of being an unemployed bum who goes about carrying out illegal jobs in a lackadaisical oh vell i guess eet eez time to keel sambaddy demeanor while he and his cousin get exploited and ripped off by everyone and his cousin calls him all the damn time to go out on dates bowling or drinking or whateverthe controls are odd and the citys colors are all manner of shades of gray brown and graybrown
it is so dismally bleak and gritty that not even a real life new york city would resemble this sort of city every day of the year
everything is in such bleak colors bordering on monochrome that it makes it a bore to look at despite the fantastic graphicsthe driving takes the cake chocolate
with lemon filling
and vanillacaramel frosting as being the absolute biggest and worst fault in this game
having driven cars in gtagta san andreas as well as in other games involving driving and saints row  as well as even driving in real life it is safe and believable for me to saythe driving in gtaiv does not come anywhere close to reality
it is a gigantic casatrof mess
it is doodoothe driving system in this game seems to be that every car you get into immediately has buttery tires and gains a thousand pounds as just going  miles an hour makes clean tight turns a physical impossibility
unless you come to a complete stop and slowly edge your way into a sharp or notsosharp turn youll end up either going far too wide out of your lane or completely losing control and spinning or swerving or crashingnothing in real life can possibly mirror the driving in this game save for perhaps driving pissdrunk wasted with two or three flat tires and several heavy objects weighing down the trunkmultiplayer is a great new addition as it lets you create your own character although with a limited number of choices so i got to create my own fantasy creation complete with long red hair a beret glasses and a rainbowcolored jacket
by the way if anyone knows of any rainbowcolored jackets in real life let me know so i may buy onedespite the fun of multiplayer or rather because of it it distracts heavily from the main campaign
the main storyline is so utterly boring and pathetic and niko bellic is such a drag to play as i havent managed to get more than three or four missions into the story before giving up entirely and playing multiplayer where ive had my most memorable experiences with the gamehowever despite all the work gone into crafting this it fails out in comparison to its predecessor because it fails to balance gritty realism with escapist cartoonishness simultaneously encouraging and punishing us for going allout sandbox murder and mayhemming while also giving us ingame tv to watch as if to mock us for our pathetic lives that we buy a video game about murder and mayhem and spend the first moments of the game buying news clothes going out on a date and watching tv all while in gamei said it in my review for saints row  but ill say here that saints row  by a different company and a complete and utter gta clone is in fact far superior to gtaivive heard about gta for years and how great the games are
ive played my fair share of openworld games and finally decided to play the one everybody seems to compare every openworld game to
this is it
ive played many more better than this
sleeping dogs la noire red dead redemption assassins creeds godfather
everything is better than this
the controls seems off
fist fighting someone is terrible and the car controls are very loose
im not impressedi didnt really know what to expect with this release
i have played every previous grand theft auto release before this
i thought the first one on playstation  was awesome along with san andreas
the others were same old same old
now this
there is nothing new in this release
its the same old same old
boring and repetitive
i think i might be done with the grand theft auto series after playing this
the friend thing they entered in this game is lame and annoyingi dont what else to say
the game is dull the main story is actually ok its very repetitive and did i say dull
im mad that i wasted  bucks on this gamei tried to like it i really really tried but its so badly made i couldnt like it
but i wanted to dont get me wrong here
some of it was funcamera control was awful really its some of the worst ive seen
likely much better on the pcmovement was again awful even to simple things like walking up a fire escape became annoying again probably better on pccover system was really bad plus the camera control mixed made it all badweapon aiming again some of the worst ever pc would be ok im sureweapon selection is so bad really
left or right on the dpad
with this many guns why not hold a button and select from a weapon wheel or somethingdriving was bad so very bad sloppy steering the cars are all over the place and the motorcycles are undrivable
i like the driving in red faction guerilla that was slickly done or maybe just done rightgraphics are not really that good not even for when the game was released but graphics dont make a good game so i over looked that factmission selection where are my check points
ok so i drive all the way across the city and try out a mission i die ok thats not bad ill just try again but when you have to restart you have to drive again all the way back across the city and hope you dont fail again
not all missions are like this but it seems like the hard ones are
why cant there be check point throughout the mission
like every other game out therethe story was ok i guess but didnt interest me i suppose i like scifi games and that seems to do it for meso all in all as this was my first gta game it will probably be my last because over all i have never been this pissed off at a game ever
oh and i tried to trade it back to at least get some of the money i paid for it but they said no we have to many of those we cant take it i think that says a lot about the game when they refuse to take a trade inwhen i got this game i was so happy i brought the special edition which is a def must have if you got the moneybut back to the game itself i was completely disappointed with this game the graphics are great a little not for me but still greatto look at everything is so life like you will be amaze on how detail everything is and living in new york myself i love that rockstar did their research on each part of liberty city to compare with new york city because of what you experience in the game is also what you most likely experience in new yorkalso liberty city is massive in gta its so big it kind of annoying going to places that are so far that it might take you about  minutes just to reach a missioni got mostly bad things to say about this game so please bare with meto start off the music in gta sucks big time i means every song that they pick out is so boring and not catchy at allalmost all the artist and their songs i do not recognize at all and whats sad is that all the stations are the same with boring music and not so funny jokesso to be honest when im driving the music is always turn off which makes me mad cause i love the soundtracks they usually put in gta but this time they fail and having it put off while driving sucksnext is the driving its so bad its not even funny when you start driving you tell yourself oh this is bad but maybe ill get use to it but i promise you that will never happenthe cars themselves always kinda look the same as well as drive the same which sucks cause if you want a fast car thats not going to happen and turning in sharp corners is hell making races stupid and not fun at alli cant tell you  how many times i cuss at the tv and threw my xbox remote on the floor just cause i could not turn my car around the corner and i end up crashing into someone else or end up in the water and repeating the damn mission from the start and take ten to  minutes just to drive and get the mission done and pray i dont crash againanother thing i hate is the story line its the worst one in the series its makes no sense and is boring as hell missions are the same shoot kill and drive which is fine because the shooting system is great and very fun the acting is great also not one bad actor to be foundat the end of the day i stop playing the game all together because of the bad driving the story is boring and music is terribleill finish it but only because of the achievements and thats it do yourself a flavor and skip itget china town wars for ds or psp its fun as hell and wont make you throw your remote on the floormy biggest beef with gta  is that it is incredibly boring
it has the pace of an rpg but without any of the aspects that make time consuming games like that worth the time investment like level building and character weapon and armor depth
the plot is okay but the game controls are sloppy controlling the helicopter is such a farce i was in disbelief and the driving around and around for hours is so dull and tedious i had to quit the game about a third of the way through before i went insane and a third of the way through was  hours
the graphics are well below par for the  as well
the voice acting is about the only bright spot
my only conclusion is that people are mindless sheep that believe hype and have no standards because this game overall is not good
so thanks a lot all you imbecilic gta drones for giving this overhyped pile  stars and convincing me to waste my time and money
also rockstar games can go take a leap for somehow making this continually unimpressive series  a bestseller i have played every gta game and other than number  which was okay the rest are flat out boringyes even vice city which other than the s music was boring
i am done with them permanently
i could even go into the absurdity of the violence not that it offends me but that it is just preposterous to even make games where a guy can get away with mayhem on such a massive scale and not be killed or tossed in jail forever
lame
i mean really though this game compared to halo  bioshock dead space modern warfare  ninja gaiden  mass effect or even crackdown
they may not be apples to apples comparisons but gta  falls far behind these games in graphics storyline pace and very important to me controls
i hate nothing more in video games than poor controls this isnt  nes days anymoreargh
i am a highstandard type individual so dismiss this review at your own peril of wasting time
life is too short and there are too many good games for you to be caught playing this junkwell i was eagerly  anticipating grand theft auto  ever since it was announced
i have been playing gta since the very first game and nearly every game has been better than i could have imagined however gta san andreas came out and that was just a ghetto clone of gta vice city
and now we have the same game as san andreas with better graphics and cut scenes but with the same horrible camera angles and camera control
so thank you rockstar games for making an awesome game with a piece of junk camera that makes the game worthless
i think i will just wait for the game to come out for on pc if it ever does so i can play gta the way it was meant to be played with a mouse and keyboardlet me point out the flaws
you cant buy safe houses
which i thought was very lame
cell phone goes off
during a shoot out
who says ting and bloodclot no rasta speaks like that
the part i hate the most is lack of cheats
you cant have a million bucks if you wanted too
the cars and bikes flip if ou make sharp turns and barley any stores to shop for cloths
you cant find any good looking cloths
no hair cuts or tats no hot coffee scenepass this gameway too much hype for this game
its alright but nothing spectacular
missions are pretty much the same throughout and gets boring after awhile
way too many simulated violence and swearing
not needed at all for a good game
if they ever come out with a gta im pretty sure i wont get itif youve never played a gta game before you might like this one
if youre a vet of the series though i cant imagine how youd see gta iv as anything but a step backwardi am not sure what they were going for maybe trying for more realism but they completely wrecked the physics so vehicles control like they are underwater as one reviewer put it
in previous gta games vehicles handled pretty well and high speed chases were a huge part of the fun
much of the challenge in gta iv comes from simply trying to steer your vehicle
usually you dont even want to go too fast because you will completely lose control which will make you easy prey for someone chasing you or will result in you plowing into a bunch of pedestrians in front of a cop which will raise your wanted level and cause them to start hunting you even though you were just trying to drive back to your apartment to save your gameeven worse are the aircraft controls
one mission took me several frustrating attempts to complete even though the objective was simply to fly around in a circuit
i finally finished it though the helicopter was belching black smoke  close to exploding at the end
result
i avoided flying vehicles like the plaguethe graphics are nothing special and in fact are quite horrible in some places with mediocre character models and many bland colors  textures repeated over  over again
this makes it hard to get a feel for exactly where you are in some parts of the city something i never had trouble with in previous games
the city also feels too big and runs the whole sandbox thing into the ground
its nice to have a huge world to explore but when  of that world is empty and gives you no reward for exploring whats the pointive also read in several reviews that there is allegedly something incredible about the story in this game
well i played for over  hours and never found out what that was
in fact id say its the worst narrative since gta and thats because your character in that game doesnt speak
everything follows the same tired rockstar formula get mission giver driver to his place drive to mission drive back home  save
i didnt finish the story but thats because it never got interesting and the gameplay became boring  tediousthe most tedious part of gta iv though is certainly the new friendship meter you get for your friends  girlfriends
going bowling with a friend or taking a date out to get fallingdowndrunk might sound like an amusing novelty but not when the game punishes you repeatedly for not doing it
your friends call you constantly usually at inconvenient times like right in the middle of missions or as youre trying to get back to your save point and want to go to see a comedy show or get food
if you decline their request they will get angry with you and your approval will plummetanother gripe is the lack of anywhere safe to store any nice or special vehicles you come across because you have no garage
the only place that saves cars are two parallel parking spots on the street outside your apartments
the problem is the vehicles must remain in a very exact position inside those spaces or will disappear next time you load your game
this happened to me more than once because the games ai traffic knocked a car just enough out of the space that it was no longer considered parkedbottom line is this series isnt fun to play anymore
and if a game is not fun then why play it
rockstar is still recycling much of what they were doing on the playstation  with gta and its gotten old now
since this game has mysteriously gotten so many high ratings though i expect more of the same when gta v comes outwell i might as well start off saying that gta is a pretty good refinement of the well loved series
the story and voice acting are good and actually flow fairly well
there is even some good character development not a lot for the npcs but still some
there are also a good amount of interesting missions
but after not too long it starts to get very repetitive
some missions are frustratingly difficult as is the standard but must be beat in order to advance
as usually you are initially locked into one area when you start the game and unlock other areas through mission completion
which is well and good but that prevents this from being a true open world experience
i have never been thrilled with the gta control scheme and this is no different
the controls are not as responsive as i like and buttons are assigned to many actions
so you will find your character doing something other than you want him too fairly often
the shooting and targeting system is much improved but the lock on system is poor
personally i hate gta i find it repetitive and annoying with a good amount of mission success resulting from just dumb luck
there are far too many chase missions some you have no trouble with and some you will be constantly foiled by npc drivers
if you are already a gta fan this is more of the same but slightly better and you will love it
if you are on the fence i would recommend a rental
and if you are luke warm to the series this iteration isnt going to convert you
good gamingmy cousin plays it when he comes over but he is the only one that plays it
i dont usually play it because it seems like rubbish but he seems to like it he is the only one that plays iti played this game at a friends house around the time it came out and i hated it
years later i find out they are coming out with a new gta game so i decided to look into this game a little more
i didnt spend to much time playing this game at my friends house  years ago because of how bad the game is so since the game is only  bucks at decided to go more in depthas i said in the description this game is a disappointment
i dont know what rockstar was thinking
the first  gta games were very good especially san andreas but this one is wayyyy offthe controls are a little different even though you can go back to classic mode
shooting seems a little more difficult and the cars handle horribly
that is probably the biggest problem with this game is the controls of the cars
the damage effects is nice and the cars no longer explode when flipped on their roofs
but the cars are difficult to control around corners
i hate the fact that you cant set the default to run
you have to press and hold a in order for him to run and there is no way to change thatthe graphics are not as good as they should be
the city is huge and has a lot of detail in it
the people reacts more life like in this game then in previous games and i like how some of the people can actually die in car accidents if their car gets hit hard enough
if it rains you will see people running some will have umbrellas others newspapers
thats a nice touch
you can do burn outs in cars and if you do them too long the tire will explode
you can still drive the car of course but it will make the cars more difficult to handle even though they are already difficult to handle
no more paramedic and firefigher missions
if you get a cop car you can check the cars computer to see crimes in the area that you can take onthe acting is good in the game
lots of cursing which i see is the norm in todays games
the movie scenes seem to be longer this time around too which i like
the missions are pretty repetitive though
you will probably get tired of this game before you even finish it
i actually have to use cheats to make the game more enjoyable for me
you die so easily in this game and body armor is hard to come by
i dont mind the character nikothere really is no point in buying this game since part  is coming out soon
i just bought it cuz i had nothing else better to do
hopefully it will be a  times better then this junk
i am glad i only paid i tried really hard to like this game i really did
i played vice city  times through played san andreas  times through
this one i still havent beat and barely pick up
its lacking
gta was known for pushing limits in gaming and for its sandbox attitude
most of the time im just asking myself why im still playing itpros the storyline is great
i think this is the most solid story yet
its creative and integral to the game
the graphics are much nicer than before
the explosions are very realistic
the characters are far more interesting than they used to be
its sad this is all i can find positivecons this should be long
where do i start
how about the first thing that made me angry
where is my sandbox
i cant change hairstyles and cant customize my clothes much
this gives me little involvement or personal belonging to the main character which i play
its like they said san andreas was way too complicated with all that clothing and hairstyles nobody liked it anyway
its stupid lets just throw it out
its part of what made me feel more into the game
without that i dont own the character im just playing as him
its a disconnectionnext i hate the fact they removed custom cars
i loved boosting cars and then pimping them out
you drive around the city find some insanely cool car then make it even more awesome
i really really miss that from gta
you cant even select what color the car changes to
whats up with that
no nitrous either
that means no insanely insane car stuntsnow one ive always hated about gta and is just worse in this one
if you ever see zero punctuation you know
i can ram through giant light poles with nothing more than a tap
i can topple hot dog stands with a scooter
yet a tiny tree or the smallest of metal rods holding up an awning and i go flying out of the windshield
cant tell you how many times that happened running from the cops after a  minute mission then having to do it all over again
consistency rockstar
maybe just oncehow about the worst peeve of them all
save points
i dont know if it changes but for the first  hours of the game your one and only save point is always a  minute drive away from where your mission ends
every time you think you should save you find yourself halfway through the city and you have to drive all the way back and on top of it pay a  toll
what
so i basically have to pay to save or run from the cops but either way i cant just save
no that would be too easyi hate the fact that rockstar tries its hardest to make the game realistic while living just outside the realm of reality but still manages to keep you from doing what would be considered actual realism
like paring my own clothes or driving through a tree
oh but i can sit and watch my character watching television
the level of realism has hit sitting on a recliner but i still cant get my hair cut
not to mention i have to eat to gain health but food is nearly impossible to find in the city of new york
its new york and it takes me like  minutes to find a stupid hamburger
cant it be on the map
because in the real ny you walk one block and youll find a sandwich shop of some kind
or how about the fact i carry thousands of dollars with me but my fridge is always emptyi preordered this game
i wanted this game
i was hoping to love this game
however this is a step backwards
its not as good as san andreas and not as fun
there are less weapons less vehicles less options and less of a sandbox
this game is in every way less than san andreas
way to let me downi have not played previous gtas and perhaps i should have continued that behavior
i enjoy most types of games and gta is reminiscent of that pretty old game police quest in its various incarnationsim certain that this game is enjoyable for very young men and boys
but as for mature folks its frequently boring
add to that the need to constantly check a map which has teenyweeny symbols showing you your location and destinations it gives me a headache after less than an hour each time i playso if you like driving irresponsibly and talking with a greek accent while you ogle cartoon women and beat up cartoon men this is a musthave
otherwise i recommend all of the halos andor a good rpg like elder scrolls insteadhad i played this game right when it came out i may have been a little more lenient
instead i played this right after red dead redemption big mistakeeverything red dead redemption did well gta iv screws up
the characters are annoying the endless cell phone ringing and obligations to your friends and girlfriends are distracting
the graphics are boring and uninspired again i know this game is a bit dated now
the people walking around are just mindless robots and dont actually interact much with the scenery
the map itself is ridiculously boring
street after street after street some with tall buildings some with short buildings oh hey theres chinatown not that they could do much with a downtown nyc atmosphere anyways just a bad choice of game locationall of these complaints could be tolerable if the missions were actually fun to play and progressed the story there was a story
instead you get go shoot pool with friend leave poolhall drunk only to find your car has been moved down the street and you have to walk extremely slow in circles drunk to get back to it fun
notor how about the countless pick up this car and drive it from point a clear across the map to point bor my favorite choose which guy that has had minimal affect on the story and your relation to the character to shoot and killoh and screw up one part of one of these missions and its back to the other side of the map for youall in all the missions were just plain boring
there are so many subplots that you completely lose track of where the end is or what you are ultimately trying to accomplish
the many faces of the protagonist niko leave him completely unrelatable
i kept waiting for the game to come to its excruciating end but it didnt
i ditched the game about halfway and went back to flower picking in red dead redemption
even that was more fun than this choreif you didnt like previous gta games this one is probably not going to do much to change your mind so pay no attention to the hype
its basically like the others unrealistic driving controls sloppy combat controls shoddy camera angles cheesy dialog lots of profanity etc
added to this game is a much improved cover system that still pales in comparison to gears of war or rainbow six or so im told i didnt make it that far and a story that reaks of a secondclass gangster flicknote that i played this game for about  hours which was about all i could stand
people say that the game becomes fun eventually but i play video games for entertainment and having to play one for  hours in the hopes that i might enjoy myself eventually is just too much work for me
then again im a casual gamer and would rather play  xbla titles than an epic game like this
i only became interested in gta when people started talking about it like it was the second coming
but honestly theres nothing new to see here
that being said if you loved the previous entries in the series and want more of the same youll probably love this game too
just dont go in expecting anything revolutionary
its amazing what passes for innovative these daysthis game is not very good for many reasonsthe touch screen controls can be finickythe sailing that occurs in the game is downright boring and very time consuming and you cant just leave your ds alone since they are enemies who attack you while your sailingsome of the puzzles are very frustrating and not fun at allduring the game you are going to have to return to the same dungeon over and over again which means you have to go through the same area again just to unlock a new area
this can get tedious considering some of the things you have to do are really stupid like carrying key pieces from  point to another all while trying to avoid enemies you cant even kill
to make things worse the moment you enter this dungeon a timer appears so you have to do it in a certain time
i dont know what nintendo was thinking when they went with this design choice but overall it pretty much destroys the game dooo noooot buuuuuuuuybeing a sequel to the wind waker i expected alot more out of this game sadly it was a major flop
the story is as expected bad because your just chasing after to find out where tetra is so you can turn her back to normal after being turned into stone
the sylus controls handle well however it would have been nice to have been able to use the dpad and the reason why this game is bad is because they force you go through the same dungeon atleast  times and you have to do the entire dungeon over again and more also you have a time limit and have to complete it in usually less than  minutes which requires you to remember everything about it while avoiding invincible yes invincible enemiesif you werent forced to backtrack to many times then this would easily be one of the best ds titles out there unfortunately it isntfable ii is a sequel to fable but honestly it might as well just be called fable again since all they did was add things and upgrade the graphicsbut heres the killer part of microsofts wannabe killerapp they didnt fix the bugs from the first game
sometimes youll find yourself rebooting your xbox over and over again due to this weird black screen bug that makes the screen black and mutes the volume and freezes the game here and there with remarkable consistency
occasionally some quests wont let you complete them although microsoft has already issued one patch for thisbut far and away the worst thing abut this game is its lack of direction
its like there were multiple people calling the shots on this game one was a really lame old guy who wanted more fart jokes and less violence one of them was a talented video game designer who didnt get much say and the rest were a team of elementary school students
the end result is really lame
i would recommend fallout  oblivion two worlds mercenaries  or  well many other actionadventure games before this onedoesnt hold up in these days
i tried to play it a few times and i just cant get into iti borrowed this game from a friend
had i paid more than  for it i would have been furiousthe good the graphics are nice the combat was fluid and it was fun to shoot people in the crotch with the gun i didnt have the game freeze on my xbox at all the dog was fun to throw the ball to convincing people to come back to your place and sleep with you was pretty funthe bad spoiler alert ridiculously easy i didnt die once the entire game the spell selector was so clunky and annoying i barely used magic  of the game the story was super lacking and the final confrontationwtf
you kill him with a music box
retarded questing was annoying because you always had to wait around  minutes to listen to people talk even after you hit skip conversation
if you didnt doors wouldnt open etc
and youd have to come back clunky item systempause menu constantly having to reopen the menu to drink an extra potion or something the whole idea of time passing for vendors to restock was a pain in the ass
every store only ever carried one of each item so youd spend hours sleeping to buy a piece of cake or something you neededall in all this was a terrible rpg probably the worst one i have ever played
if you want to play it save your money and borrow it or buy it used
it isnt worth more than  bucksafter about  hours in my experience can be summarized with two words frustrating and disappointing
and this is such a shame because i enjoyed the first fable immensely enough to rate it a perfect  starswithout a doubt the single biggest problem in this game is the lagging and framerate stuttering
i didnt think a game in this day and age on the  would ever have such terrible performance
this would be somewhat tolerable if it affected only a small portion of the game but sadly it is everywhere
whether im pausingunpausing the game startingleaving a job talking to a store owner scrolling through a list of items etc theres hiccups and stutters galore
youd think with all the processing power of the  at its disposal the game would be able to load up a small miniscule item in an inventory list without hiccups
things really take a turn when im dyeing or changing my clothes im talking delays of up to ten seconds whenever i scroll up or down even once on the list
this is all the more inexcusable considering that fable  never had any lagging issues whatsoeveranother thing i cant wrap my head around is the floaty loose imprecise controls
its actually a step backward compared to fable  the controls felt tight and sharp but here its like trying to steer a freakin boat
theres also a slight delay from the moment i push the left stick to the moment the hero actually moves
is there some reason why the controls shouldnt be as tight and responsive as say saints row  or fallout 
the controls become incredibly annoying when i want to focus on a specific person or object in the environment and i have to wrestle with the controls several times before i can get the hero to face exactly the right way
simply moving my hero around and looking at things should be mindless and obvious so much so that really i shouldnt even have to devote brain cells thinking about it
it is one of the most basic mechanics of a game and shouldnt become a constant chore in itselflionhead also made some curious design choices that make me scratch my head
for instance why am i allowed only one save slot
are they kidding me
even back in the nes era games like zelda allowed more slots
again this is a step back from fable  where i was allowed  if i remember correctly  three save files and within each file were  slots for a total of up to fifteen saves
why the cutbackanother head scratcher concerns how civilians react when i pull out a weapon in their midst
if i pull out a weapon in front of a crowd for no reason i lose points with the civilians that makes sense
what does not make sense is that when i pull out a weapon for a good cause ie
to kill bandits that appear in the distance i still lose points
dont these people realize i just helped them
what lionhead couldnt be bothered to program the civilian ai
to be able to recognize the difference
this annoys melooking past these issues what ive seen of the game so far is decent and serviceable the main story is okay but not great the graphics are good although eye candy by itself is never enough to hold my interest the music is welldone and theres a good variety of stuff to do not only in the form of side quests but also minor activities
ive really stuck with the game and tried to get to its heart but i hate that all too often playing this game ends up feeling not like entertainment but like work due to its technical issues and bad design choices
ive just about run out of patience
this is truly a shame because i had such high hopes
edit and whats up with the map
useless
its so tiny that you can never figure out where everything is
and its not even interactive its just a static picture
a far cry from the likes of saints row  and oblivioni was not a big fan of the original fable and didnt have high expectations for this one
in my opinion its actually somewhat worsethe storyline is unimaginative and mediocre at best
the endings suck and dont make alot of sense
the graphics are very cartoonish and it made it very difficult for me to get into the game
there is very limited choice in weapons and no armor only clothing most of which makes you look stupid
there are a handful of special weapons to acquire but they are very difficult to get or find and they are not much better then weapons you can buy or makeyou can marry divorce buy property and work jobs
you have a bunch of stupid emoticon type behaviors you can learn that seem to have little purpose other then to waste timecombat is pretty much hack and slash and the the diversity of foes is limitedinteraction with npcs is limited and one dimensional
its worth a playthrough if you like rpgs but not much morei beat fable  around  timesthis one i beat  timefable  is a downgrade from fable  in almost every waythe combat is genaric and shallowstory is just horribleif you can call it a storymagic is horribleall spells have practically the same effect and are difficult to swith in combatgun aiming is a minor improvmentcharacter variance is ok at besthas some good environmentsover forgettablegreat animation not enough content
this game too me about  hours to completely beat and i am not a great game player
the main story is a very short sequence of quests
there are side jobs but nothing significantly long
i think maybe the idea is to start over and play differently but i cant be bothered to do that since i already know how the main story will end now
save your money or maybe wait until this game is in the bargin binfables greatest criticism was how short it was and simple
a short hack n slash rpg
no different here
in fact this sequel is even shorter than the first fable you blink once and youll miss the entire storythe main quest is like an  minute episode on adult swim compared to a one hour drama
its short way short
the story itself is poorly put together and lacks any depth
from one point directly to another to then another about four full points to the end thats the story
there is no building of characters or much detail behind the single plot just very fragmented points of what is suppose to be the plotthroughout the entire main quest i kept thinking cant wait to get started getting pass the beginning to the juicy middle part thatll lead to the climax never happened
the story began to just end abruptly
very slapstick it felt the entire storythe gameplay itself lacks from severe frame drops time to time as well as numerous glitches had a daughter frozen even after moving family finnicky targeting controls etc
no less the glitches arent game breaking just annoyingmore game breaking is the menu very slow and cumbersome
everything requires you to visit the menu the time potions food books everything and anything you must go through the slow cumbersome menu
horrificthe world itself is gorgeous though very constrained
there are more cities in the first fable and more weather effects as well there is no snow in f nor any snowy town as there was in the first was very disappointed by this as i loved the snowy town in fable and usually do in any game
moreover everything is zoned
this is worse than zoning in any mmorpg as it takes a good minute or so to load between zones which takes you out of the gameinstant travel is available once you visit the area which imo kills immersion would rather travel on foot or mount
as the journey is half the fun
but in f that journey could mean  load screens which take far too long just easier to instant travel
also between zones time will skip greatly days at times as it takes xx amount of hours to travel between zones
very saddespite all these flaws the game itself was alright until i mistakenly finished the main quest all too soon
the rest of the questsjobs are all repetitive
the jobs all involved hitting the a button at a peculiar time
the quests all run about the same there seems to be only  different quests in the entire game just rehashed with different titlesfable  absolutely fails on delivering its promise yet again
the game is basically to poorly construed concepts put together to create one halfbaked game
if the social aspects of the game were greater it could very well carry the game in spite of the short story and repetitive quests but its not not close at all
the game then itself is way too short and very unrewarding for additional time spent pass the main storylineall in all another let down
am i surprised
yes very
was expecting much from f and am absolutely shocked to see it fail in delivery of promises and even more surprised to see it as shorter and less detailed than the first fablerent this
please do yourself a favor
saints row  i bought a week earlier and while short as well though no where near f short this must be a new record far more entertaining with greater replay value
i need to stop letting myself get sucked into buying these halfbaked games or the industry will never get out of this rut of releasing crap do not buy the le
i bought that after getting the low low price from amazon months in advance the junk isnt worth it
the armor is nice but eh
the sword you can only get right before the end of the main quest so not much worth it either
pass on it please do rentthis is a continuation of fable but this game is no way shape or form anything better than fable if anything it is a step backwords
the graphics are in alot of ways worse than fablethe music is exactly like fablethis game in general did just not do the trick for me
i would rather play through the entire first game than play through one mission of this
they tried i give them creditbut they would been better off putting downloadable content on xbox live for the first fable instead of coming out with a brand new gameget fable original version for the xboxand leave this alone trust me your not missing anythingill this is a game that is sort of like elder scrolls but not as good
it has a somewhat interesting plot the gameplay is enjoyable and the quests are entertaining but the maps suck
i never know where i am because you just get this little map that changes depending on what region you are in and is nearly impossible to use
so basically youre stuck wandering around from place to place without any idea how to get around
the game does provide you with a glowing path to the next goal youve set but its not enough for you to ever get your bearings
i gave up on this one after about  hoursfable was among my favorite games for the xbox
fable ii promised alot and delivered a game that is seriously lacking many qualities
the story is tedious and frankly boring the maps are difficult to use the action is sporadic and often not very good in total the game over promised and under delivered
rather than a great sequel to a great orginal game this came off as a tired retread almost a low budget knock off of the original
a tremendous dissappointment
i would add the the added adult content really makes this game inappropriate for anyone under  years of age
this game was a tragic failurethe company has shuttered its servers leaving many parts of the game unusable
you can not complete this game
this would be a great game if it could be played as intendednote this review is for the single player onlyinstallation  you can select single player only and the game will install without forcing you to install steam
thank you
some people dont have an internet connection and others like myself dont have a high speed connection so games that require steam are not playablethe game is sold as an actionrpg but the role playing features are minimal
there is no choice of sex race or class
you cant customize your character at all
there are no attributes like strength dexterity etc
a very limited number of skills can be selected as you proceed through the game
you dont get to loot fallen enemies except for a few weapons
economics seems to be nonexistentyou must play in first person perspective
the game is totally linear at least as far as i played which admittedly wasnt far
there is no freestyle exploration
the game just proceeds from one scene to the next
you have an objective and must complete it successfully before you can move on
fail and you just have to keep playing it over and over until you succeed
checkpoint saves are made automatically although you can save manually at any point
fairly early in the game i reached a scene that could be described as a jumping game which was also timed
take too long and you fail and have to start over  i hate trying to jump in first person perspective
after a number of failures i just gave up and quit the gameon the plus side the graphics and audio were fine
the environment had many interactive elements
you could pick up and throw things kick enemies off ledges or against spikes why would there be so many walls with spikes projecting from them
 etcin summary the game was not at all what i expected from a rpg
if you like linear first person perspective games with a lot of jumping then this would be a decent gamefirst the good
this game uses the enviroment and gives a number of options to complete  most goals using magic stealth or brute force
it is rather amazing to be able to utilize so much of the world as opposed to the usual eyecandy other games give you but no interactionthe bad
this game is short very short
i bought it recently and would have been seriously angry to have paid the original retail price for this game
there are serious technical issues going on with this game which include audio stuttering slowdowns and hard crashes and some hotkeys just stop working
much of this is related to the source engine and is found in other games using that source engine but thats no exuse
the game also has a bit of challenge issue in that it moves from incredibly easy to moments of frustratingly hard
it wouldnt be so bad if it was consistent
also in this date and age games should not be this linear there is no deviating from the main game except a few minute quests and there is only one single male character what no female story line
also the do it this one way or reload approach is not a next generation game methodology especially when the loading times are patheticlastly the multiplayer game doesnt play anything like a the singe player
if they could have create a game that was thoughtful and challenging like the single player as opposed to the quick brawling fests of the multiplayer then i would have given it more stars
at the price the game sells for now sure its worth ithopefully in the future the company will put more effort and technical expertise into their products this could have been incrediblefor  youd think the developers would spend a little more time creating quality graphics
im running a high end card nvidia  gts and this game looks like it was created  years agoreally not sure why people like this game
its like a time machine back to graphics and gameplay from skip iti expected a game that was more fun
the part in getting out of town never did work
i was in the right passage but could not get over the fence into the next section
i then read that the mother was murdered
the game needed to lighten up and a little humor somewhere would helplousy graphics dumb story not very fun at all
however no freezeups or hiccups
i played  it for a while and then just gave up on it
instead buy call of juarez bound in blood  now this is a fun worthwhile game to playthe game has a good look and is very easy to play
i bought it when it first came out and realized that the  price tag was way over priced
my daughter who was  at the time got a real kick out of the game
its just too bad there werent free content updates to the game
it is like a little train set in your home without taking up all the space
as was said in another review we expected more from sid
he doesnt care though he has the money to not carebe warned
this is not a train sim nor a tycoon gamethis was made to compete with the rts games
problem isit even fails at thatit is very fast paced
months roll by in seconds
thetime periods do not match whats going on in the gameit can take  months game time for a train to go from losangeles to san diego which happens in about  seconds ifthatit almost seems it was designed like most pc games todayso that it could be easily played on a console
there arevery few options and granularity on controlsthe ai stinks
the trains are too large for the land andlaying track is a nasty task
if your track drop doessomething funky you cant undo itif you want some positives well its somewhat playablebah scratch that it was a waste of money
i was going togive this  stars but i cant
this game has failed injust about every aspect i can think of
if you are likethe rest of the growing population of adrenaline junkieswho desire fast paced thumb twitching mostly brainlessaction this game is for you phooeyi loved railroad tycoon and all the other various railroad games
but this one its just awful
it lacks the depth of the prior games and fails to behave like a simulation
best best description of it is that it is a poor arcade gamego play the railroad tycoon series and skip this onejust in time for christmasseveral significant steps backward with this game as compared to rrtthe economic engine is simpler and less entertaining than rrthaving to install and operate signals is a real throwback eliminated in rrtthe graphics start out fun and cute but quickly get oldit is not as challenging as rrt from a business sim perspectiveas someone here says its not rrti heard about railroads and preordered it based on two things one i was lead to believe by the reviews and forums that this was essentially railroad tycoon updated and two sid meir had never let me down
i like all sid meir games except this one
this game pales when compared to railroad tycoon or rrt ii
i dont like rrt iii either but sids name wasnt on that one
i started playing rrt around  on a dos machine
i was hoping that all the game play would be back
yes rrt was a complex game but this game has been dumbed down so far that its not even fun
laying track exactly where you want it is a pain now
pesky train switching yards hotels post offices dont worry about it all taken care of for you
the maps seem overly condensed and gives the impression that your playing in a small space compared to the first game
im boxing this back up and hoping to find a sucerrr buyer on ebay
keep your dos version if you still have iti brought this game because i love sid meiers game but this has to be his worst game by far
even the demo is confusing and boring
game play is below parthere was so much hype for this game when it was first announced
with sid meier at the helm it seemed like it was destined to be a hitsadly it is so buggy and is a severe disappointment
the game crashes tot he desktop every now and then
the gameplay gets choppy as more citiestrains are included within a scenario
this choppiness and crashing happens even on an intel coreduosaphire xxtx machine built it myself and yes all my drivers were up to date
laying out track while it is easy it can also get very frustrating
making junctions is just as frustrating as wellthe realism factor is hardly present
when you lay track through a city the city simply parts the waves so you can place tracks within a city
the animations for the cities as well as the industries are bland
the trains while moving on the track are nice but when they reach their destination the train sits there then turns around and goes the other way
if it continues on its way the train fades slightly then goes on its way
when the train reaches a junction when another trains reaches the same point it makes you hit your forehead eith the pam of your hand and say cant be
the trains look confused and seem like to just stop and go nowherewhen you great a consist list cars added to your locomotive all you do is click
if you add passenger cars you dont even see any people
even when you are picking up raw materials at either factories or picking up mail you dont see a soulthere was a lot of hype that hobbiest who miss building their train layouts or for people who have an interest in the train hobby but dont have the room there would be an option to build your own layout
unfortunately its just like the scenarios but in sandbox modefor some people this game would appeal to them but others who love realism tycoon and business sims will be disappointed
by the way this is not railroad tycoon enjoyed the game  graphics are nice and basic game play can be picked up very quickly
unfortunately the drm requires the disc and apparently an internet connection every time you play
what is worse is that the drm occasionally decides the disc is a copy instead of the original and wont let you play
the game crashes from time to time for no apparent reason i have installed the patch and have a pc far beyond requirements and i suspect the drm may be responsiblethis is yet another game that i would probably play over and over if it werent for securom drm restrictions securom version 
as a result after a few days of play i am about to uninstall the game and will probably never install it again and will be far less likely to buy another sid meiers title againim not trying to boast or claim to be a nostradamus of game prediction but when september rolled around and there was still only one totally meaningless preview video and a handful of screenshots showing at most a train on a track next to some ridiculously offscale buildings floating around on the net i knew this was a dumbed down rush job
from what ive read on gaming forums that at least one developer has participated in this was never meant to be railroad tycoon  and to that end at least theres truth in advertisingbeyond that however the changes are designed solely to cater to the casual gaming crowd and to drive up sales
i cannot imagine any other reason since released as is this game was bound to disappoint longtime rrt series fans
the fact that they do not even include a map or scenario editor to extend the pitifully short life of the games included maps is perhaps the most disappointing
the scale of the maps has already been beaten to death but those other reviewers are not inaccurately describing their cramped nature
everything else that was even remotely challenging track laying the stock market chained economies etc
in the previous titles is more or less gone or dumbed down to near pointlessnessthis is a game that caters to the sims crowd and that is not a bad thing in itself but i fear games like this will become ever more numerous as sales numbers overtake depth and challenge and catering to smaller more intense and educated gamers
if this is the heir to railroad tycoon god forbid what civ  may end up asthe game is fun but a bit buggy
very large sand box to play in but very simple ai and limited in what you accomplish
still all in all good funyes the game is really fun but no its not really worth it  go after battlestations pacific if anything  multiplayer is way bettergetting back on topic bsm is fun because it teaches a little about ww in the pacific which is usually never covered in most ww games
one reason because of this is that very little people in america really look at ww and think of it as hostility from japan but rather the nazi threat and genocide
japan had a lot of bad things going for it but it wasnt looked down upon as much as the germans threat
has a very difficult system of controls that requires the use of tutorials to get through but is worth it in the end
this is the embodiment of us and japanese navy fights and is very epic looking and playing with
while having a one on one ship fight is lame add in a carrier or two on both sides and an airfield you have got the makings of a game
you can be one of  naval vessels  patrol boat submarine cargo ships light cruiser destroyer heavy cruiser battleship and carriers
using these and the abilities of the airplanes aboard the carrier you attack each other using rts and tactics to your advantage
of the airplanes you can be any one commander of a squadron usually this isnt the best of ideas
there are also land installations like airfields jetties and shipyards where you can recruit other ships you cant get on a carrierhistorically this is a very accurately told tale even if the story was fictionthe story is absolutely pathetic but what should one expect if its all about the game play
multiplayer  ewwwww
its got problems mostly because no one plays this anymore but also because the patches dont work on my win  machinegameplay  very interesting  its a cross between a see navigator airplane simulator and sub commanding minigames all packed into one and the look of it makes it seem very intensegreat  player game sucks on multiplayeri had bought this same product awhile ago before circuit city closed their stores down and was happy with it for the st week or  after that it felt like something just fell apart inside it
the volume button became extremely hard to move
if you barely touch the thing while its plugged in it makes a whole lot of static in your headset like the whole thing just does not connect right
so i decided maybe to try again since nobody seems to make headsets with this type built in anymore and it is a lot easier keeping the mute and volume right under the controller instead of dangling somewhere around your chest
well it turns out to just be crap
i would not buy this product again
everybody keeps saying they get an annoying static noise when i use this but whenever i bypass it my voice comes out crystal clear
microsoft needs to make an official version although then it would probably be triple the price knowing microsoftbad stuff out of the way first
the dialogue is pretty useless at times and the dialogue thats not useless is very adolescent in nature
i get the feeling that they added a lot of filler text for some reason
they make a point of telling you how to do something simple like climb a ladder then they tell you again then they tell you that they just told you before reminding you how to do it just to make sure you didnt forget from the first  lessons
if i had the attention span of  year old that might be helpful
given that im  its a bit insulting and at best slows down gameplaythe voice acting is pretty silly too
some of the speech is still in japanese which is pretty lame they didnt bother to translate it
for instance every time a character fights or a fight ends theres a random voice blurb they say
thats a nice touch and all the human characters have english voices
however all of the golem characters have voice blurbs too but theyre all in japanese
its small but annoyingive also got one of the cooler characters that is evidently poisoned or has some negative status effect on her because shes constantly at  hitpoint and  magic point
i cant seem to find out whats wrong with her through her status sheet in the interface
i even looked through the manual for some info no dicedont even get me started on the overlygay guy in your party at first
im not saying that to bash someones sexuality in any way but this guy is way over the top
the interface is also a bit clunky at times and they dont go through some of the stuff that they really should spend time on
for instance they dont really explain what skill points are and that you can spend them to improve your character stats and to learn new skills
i was through the first boss before i found the interface to spend skill points to boost stats
at that point i had a huge cache built up so i buffed all my stats but then when i went to learn skills i didnt have any left because i didnt realize you used the same pool of points to boost stats and learn skills
i could have used less instruction on how to use ladder and more on elements like thisthere are some limitations on where you can go and what you can do that surprise me too
you would think youd get a lot more freedom on a  game
i get the feeling that this game was made simply for the sake of having an rpg on this console not because it was a cool game to makethe good
the graphics are pretty good and the combat system is decent
dont get me wrong i really expect better graphics from the  but the stuff in this title is passable
some of the magic and particle effects are cool but again not as spectacular as what id expect from overall it seems inspired by the final fantasy series with heavy favoring to ff vii but with elements from pokemon gotta collect them all and some elements from the full metal alchemist anime serieschallenge rating is pretty simple too
im not a genius but ive won every single encounter ive run into
only one or two has been challenging in the least
theres not a way to adjust difficulty that ive been able to findi find myself playing the game through but i dont think its because its such a cool game
i think its because i dig rpgs and ive already paid for this one
the game as a whole seems like it was geared more toward the  year old crowdif you are a diehard rpg fan then you might consider picking up a used copy but dont expect to be blown awayenchanted arms is an anime based turn based rpg
now that this is out of the way let me briefly explain why i would not recommend this game to anyone today in  the game was released in  the graphics are very outdated if you care about such details
the intro movie is very cool but when you get into the gameplay itself the age really shows
the area during battle mode is divided into a grid where d characters stand in their battle stance waiting for your order
the interface is very similar to classic jrpg like final fantasy or phantasy star
the animations are very repetitive and do not have much variety in movement
the special effects for attack or defense spells and other weapons are ok lots of nice flashing shapes and lights
you can move the camera into various positions plan out your attack paths or move very easily
what is especially nice is the quick mode or auto mode one just does the battle choices for you another avoids the steps that ask you to movethe problems arise when you are in the movement mode or outside the battle
let me give you an example
there is a class of students and in this particular scene all the male students are one to one copies of one another and the girls as well
it is annoying
when you move you can barely see any shadows anywhere
the npcs do not show much life either
if you were to see similar characters talk to each other they have the same look with exception of haircuts or eye colors
when you run around you look like a robot and run with limited animations
when you face an obstacle your character keeps repeating the the running motionenglish language voice overs are horrible with the exception of few characters
i cannot tell how bad or good the japanese voicing isanother strange or annoying thing whatever you might call it is the voice acting and presentation of one character who is suggested to be a crossdresser or homosexual
the issue i have with this is not that he is there but how he is presented
if you were to imagine any gay stereotype its in the character
think south parks big gay al there is a collar face makeup exposed stomach and girly gestures
just makes me think whyi would avoid this game at all costs
there are many better jrpgs for xbox  out there
blue dragon is a great alternativecreative games has once again released a total war game that is loaded with bugs
these bugs include a very passive ai which often sits still while the player shoot arrow after arrow into the enemy army
laggy game for anyone that does not have a high performance machine even with graphic levels turned way down
pathfinding bug that has the ai walking back and forth during city assaults
several crash to desktop bugs
overpowered agents particularly the inquisitors which seem to kill everything
not a challenging game with too many easytoexploit bugs
the game in its current form is not much funnow there are better aspects to the game
the graphics are better
the ai does seem to better in battle when it isnt passive the diplomacy is better than rome total war but that isnt saying much
it is still simplistic and does a lot of irrational things
a patch was supposed to be immediately available to correct bugs that were identified by ca prior to release
however ca is now saying they need a minimum of  weeks to correct all the bugs
i suspect  weeks is very optimistic
the patch is supposed to correct some of the more obvious bugs
although they are releasing an unpacker for mods modding is very very limited since models can no longer be changed
this essentially makes modding very limitedthis game is exceptionally frustrating on the strategic level
i actually prefer the old game piece model in medieval total war i to this
the map causes all sorts of unintended tactical and strategic dilemmas
the ais  diplomacy is atrociousim playing the latest patched version as venice russia and scotland respectively at medium difficulty
wave after wave of all types of countries attack allies break their alliances and attack i never declare war ever and despite my attempts to buy peace i end up at war with the entire map
after this when i check my reputation the dealbreaking snakes have something like a reliable reputation and i have mixed or worse
sound like funthen there is the pope
you get hammered by some snake of a catholic nation and try to retaliate or take out an offending fleet and the pope who was very often from my faction slaps you with a cease hostilities mission effectively tying your hands
this is especially fun when the offending party has troops or fleets in delicate bottleneck locations of the map
if you fail the mission you get excommunicated and your cities will promptly revolt
your basically screwed until the pope dies and you get reconciled meanwhile your war effort gets it in the shorts because you are too busy trying to quell revolts and lower your taxes so you cant afford to keep your army upexpect to see wave after wave of generic troops pounding into you for no good reason until you uninstall the game and place the dvd in your waffle iron eyes leaking tears of frustration as the iron leaks wisps of smokei went out the first day mtw came out and bought it installed it and tried it out
i was a big fan of the first one which completely changed rtss and was really enthusiastic about the sequel
i was a bit skeptical when i saw it was done by sega which completely destroyed the fun in rome total war when they unleashed their own version
needless to say mtw is no differentlets start off with my gaming rig
it is important to know what the reviewer is using to play the game in my opinionspecifications ghz amd  processorsnvidia  gtx mb gbthat covers the basics needed to run the game
now i am using the most advanced and sophisticated graphics card on the face of the earth
however mtw doesnt seem to care
i average  fps with everything turned up to full and i cant place over  troops in a battle or i risk crashing
that is truly pathetic
honest to god why would you even buy something thats barely going to get a playable fps rate
if youve seen the trailer you need to ask yourself what the developers were using to create that
mistake number the battles can be amazing but your graphics card is probably going to melt if you want them to look nice
mine almost did no im not kidding
however the ingame ai is very unbalanced and seems to cheat at times
your own units also have a habit of quitting an order youve assigned to them
the most unbalanced aspect of mtw is the autosolve battles
if you dont want to fight one yourself then click this little button
be warned that outnumbering the enemy  to  probably isnt going to count and youll probably losesound is something that mtw doesnt fail to capture
it still has great music and voiceovers but they get repetitive after a whilethe events system uses the worst drawings i have ever seen to describe what is going on
they look like bmp images done with ms paint
very outdated and lame
couldnt you at least contact the people who made the paintings for rome total war
those were true beautiesin game units are also something that are normally pathetic
sherwood forest archers yeah sure they own if youre english and pwn all others but they are fictional
we want units that actually existed
remember the flaming pigs in rtw
just about that badthe look of fights is still spectacular
soldiers go one on one and use a large assortment of moves including thrusts slashes stabs shield smacks and moremultiplayer is just terrible now that is if you can even access a session due to small amount of servers running
be glad if you can find more than  totalin conclusion id say you should probably buy the predecessor of mtw or rome total war
mtw needs a lot more work done
i feel it was released too early and should have been tweaked a bit more for bugs and repetitive issuesi already know that this review is probably going to receive  ratings in trust and tons in this is false
well its going to be coming from the fanboys
thats just an early warning to you fair people
personally i dont care
medieval  does need to be reworkedi thought that cooking on my ds was going to be great
and it was forthe first  minutes
there just arent enough variations to keep you interested for long
chopping onion and cutting up potato is the exact same motionjust like measuring rice and measuring water is the same
there werent that many different dishes to make
so if you can already cookstay in the kitchen
if you have no idea how to cook and are afraid to touch raw meat then maybe you should try this before attempting the real thingnot used much  kids not impressedyour kids might like it but not used by oursgood buying luckbought this for my niece
she claimed that she loved cooking mama
i guess she didnt like this one
this review is based on her liking of the game
she told me not to buy this game again for her
sorry cooking mama you didnt make this mama happyhaving played all nancy drew games i really was disappointed with danger by design
where graphics are still great like another reviewer states wheres the lourve eiffel tower and other popular landmarks in paris
just a guess but her interactive is trying to grab a much younger inexperienced audience
omitting all the great facets of previous games challenge puzzles triviafacts character development has really made danger by design boring and uncaptivating
cant believe they didnt take advantage of the french language in this episode
they have resorted to dull repetition
the majority of the her effort is focused primarily on teaching newbies how to play their game and pitching previous episodes which is fine but those of us who appreciate nancy drew have been abandoned left out of the equation
majorly disappointing bummer of a game
maybe kids in th grade and under will enjoy this more
doubt it it moves way too slowly to hold their fast edit attention
creature of kapu cave is next but im not optimistic nor should other veteran sleuths beevery so often her interactive should give out free games for us die hard nd fans who play them all with high hopes the next game will take us off on a great mystery adventure with challenging puzzles
sometimes they meet and exceed our expectations
other times they insult our intelligence like they did with this game
danger by design was a disaster from start to finish and along with kapu cave should be freeyes it really was that bad as far as im concernedi wish i would have downloaded a trial of this game before i bought it
i havent gotten past the st part where you have to remember all the different kinds of teas for all the moods one of the characters has
its too involved for me
i like to play these games to relax not to remember  things
i have purchased more hidden object games from amazon that i do love to play but this isnt one of themthis games sucks
dont waste your money on it the game is only  hours long tops
if you want to play a great mob game play the godfatherthe sopranos  road to respect is a grand theft auto style game where you work your way up through the mob family mission by mission
there is great voice acting  but less great gameplayfirst off you need to be prepared for how short this game is
ive played games where the cinematics alone took up multiple hours and to be honest with this game being based on a multiyear fantastic award winning series with awesome actors i was expecting that here too
however the dialogue is often very trite and there isnt nearly enough of ityou are not one of the main characters from the show  instead you are an up and coming punk a bastard child of big pussy
you are of course given silly little tasks at first but as you prove your worth they give you more and more challenging things to do
often youre roaming around classic locations from the showheres the problem
you would think with such a wealth of material to work from and such fantastically complex intricate plots that they could easily pull off a multihour game
sadly that is not the case
instead you get a pretty straightforward series of activities that could come from pretty much any clone gamethe graphics are not stellar either
the ps has been out for enough years that some rather impressive graphics have been created for it
there were numerous issues with the sopranos that really a game with this kind of backing should not have displayedi do adore the sopranos and admit it was fun to romp around in the sopranos world
so lets take it for granted that some sort of game in the sopranos would be made and that it would involve the cast members
that is never really a question here
the question is whether that world is a quality done world
im afraid the answer is  not reallycertainly if you adore the sopranos rent this game to see what its all about
youll probably get through it long before the rental period is up and only have spent a few dollars
if you find that you adore talking to real voice characters over and over again enough to own it you can always buy yourself a copy at that pointa sopranos game really doesnt sound like a bad idea
with all the gta rip offs to flood the video game world youd think that one with the sopranos name on it along with most of the talent involved with the game from hbos highly influential show you might figure that maybe a sopranos game would actually be kind of good
well youd be wrong
the sopranos road to respect is yet another shameless gta style knock off that has so many problems and things going against it that its a wonder the game ever got off the ground
you play as the illegitimate son of deceased mobster big pussy trying to make a name for yourself working for tony soprano
you take on missions supplied to you from all kinds of familiar characters boring tedious missions that are pretty much all alike
and you do this while putting up with ugly graphics and textures poor collision detection graphical glitches and twitchy controls
the only saving graces for sopranos is that most of the cast from the show is here supplying the voices for their characters
james gandolfini michael imperioli vincent pastore tony sirico steven van zandt and robert iler are all here and theyre all great and the story is interesting as well plus some of the ways you can dispatch your enemies are bloody and inventive
besides that the rest of the game is a dud
its a shame too because the potential was great here for a solid game that would do its license justice
but alas the sopranos road to respect is a game thats best left to sleep with the fishesthis game appeared quietly despite being adapted from such a highlyacclaimed showand after the four or five hours it will take you to finish the whole thing youll know why
this is not targeted to gamers as much as fans of the show as another novel bit of sopranos merchandise
given the source material its a waste of a good opportunitywheres the rest of the game
i have to applaud all involved for taking most of the main actors their likenesses and voices as well as real interiors the bada bing satriales etc and convincingly digitizing them
even the script fits into the continuity of the series and is more or less consistent with the show
they laid the grounds for a fun if irresponsible and absurd gamethen they forgot the rest of the gameyou play the illegitimate child of the late sal big pussy bonpensiero which means vincent pastore appears in the game continuing to milk his short tenure on the show
youre a bum basically until tony soprano gives you a chance in his organization
now you do errands for the soprano family interacting with the main characters on the show tony silvio paulie walnuts christopher the notyetdead vito etc
the favors and missions all involvebeating people
thats pretty much the whole game the same mission of beating people to death
this is not gta sopranosstyle or even a sad shadow of eas far far superior the godfather
you just click through the cut scenes and then beat a few people to deathin an alley in a club in a hospital etc
there is no driving at all
the gun play is rare and poor weapons aiming the whole bit
besides shooting people is dangerous as it brings heat
better to beat people to death
a lot of people
theres the nice feature of being able to pick up random objects to beat people with chairs crutches bats bottles even a vacuum cleaner if i recall
and the beatings can be separated into two categories
on the one hand you have wiseguys and punks that you run across in the soprano family business
on the other hand are bystanders and wisemouths who make the unfortunate error of challenging your manliness and ethnicityit gets comical because youre reduced to just clicking through the story to move it along with no challenge from the gameplay
there are a lot of cut scenes with story and dialogue as you help young aj throw a rave and help tony as he battles an oldschool philly mobster who doesnt respect the fat man
blah blah blah
its a few hours of fun for fans of the show but the difficulty level is a joke
and yes the game ends with you whacking out said philly mobsternot recommended for purchase unless you want to hawk it on ebay after the game can be finished in a day
real nice game for the kids too
the young uns can learn the proper way shake people down and beat their heads to a pulpi bought this game at my local gamestop and the cashier reassured me with a good choice
after playing for a few stages and quests i discovered that the game is rather repetitive and all you do is hacknslash monsters to no endbooooringit kinda sucks writing reviews about games that have already been reviewed by a bunch of people
for one less people are likely to read another review about the same game just to hear the same story blah blah blah so the sum of the reviews is that children of mana is a mediocre game and that is no lie
i cant say much about the mana series because the only other mana ive played was secret of mana and i absolutely loved it
then again i loved every single rpg on the sneschildren of mana is addictive in the beginning but only in the way that most character developing games are addicting you want to level up you character
something in your gaming soul drives you to want to level up your character in the same inane way you want to catch them all
or level up your pokemon for hours upon hours for no apparent reason whatsoever
to which youll soon discover the horrible redundancy of this gamechildren of mana is a dungeon crawler and a horribly made one at that
simply put the title pinball of mana would have been more befitting than children of mana
hitting monsters causes the monster to bounce back into some other object in the dungeon which in turn begins to bounce around and at some point in this pinballlike movement you get hit and you start bouncing around until you finally hit something and stop bouncing
then you repeat the process all over againi was extremely disappointed since i had taken such a long hiatus from gaming and was looking forward to my first mana title since secret
the main story is drabby and chock full of long boring dungeon crawling
the side quests which make the game infinitely longer are more boring more elongated dungeon crawling
it seems like theres no end to the redundancystill some people like that and it could consume hours upon hours of brainless hacking and chopping and bouncing around
if thats what youre into this game was made especially for you
but please dont buy it for the retail hopefully heroes of mana will redeem the mana series ive heard some disappointing remarks about the other mana titles and would love to see a great followup to the legendary rpgs of the snesyes i am calling for a ds chrono title or a gaia title lufia title  anything
hell give me a followup to the secret of evermore i dont care
i would really like to see a chrono trigger ds ooooohhh wouldnt that be sweetchildren of mana is the latest squenix addition to a long line of mana rpgadventure games that have moved into the nintendo handheld world  this one being a game for the ds
and out of all the mana games ive played it is by far the worst and possibly one of the worst rpg games ive played
from story to game mechanics this is almost a complete lemon so if you dislike negative reviews just skip this
ill try and summarize the paragraphs so you can get my main points without having to read my entire tiradecomplete lack of utilization for the ds hardwarethe first thing i noticed about the game is the complete lack of stylus play and the poor utilization of the dualscreen system
theres all this fantastic hardware for ds and most of the games ive played have used it to some good effect but com almost completely ignores it opting to use one screen for mapsstatus when in most cases your maps and status arent really needed
after the opening screen the stylus is not used at all
in fact i have to wonder why they even put that one touchscreen in therecomplete lack of character storyeven in the last gba handheld installment of the series the story had depth
your characters had a history and a reason why they met
and the supporting characters had some really touching material
in com the village priestess is kidnapped and all the village elders and warriors get together to discuss what must be done
your character who seems to have no real station in the village voulenteers himherself to go and everyone is just like bai
the potions shop is to your right on your way out of the village
not even a no its too dangerous
or let me teach you how to fight before you go
and thats only the first of many such oddities
either the localization team has completely butchered and removed whatever insightful dialog existed or it just never didcomplete lack of storysort of ties in with my last point
at the end of each zone you fight a boss monster and someone comes out to tell you good job and give you the tiniest scrap of explanation and some artifact that allows you to access a new area of the game
you go back to the village speak with the veteran and he asks you to go scope out another crisis
of the handful of zones ive been to thats been the extent of it
sidequests are available through a shop but you never meet who youre helping and the fun of discovering the sidequest is eliminated because theyre just handed to you
so far though im assuming this changes later there are no towns to explore and no benefits to talking to peopleweak character developmentand by character development i mean level progression and the like
most of your development happens through the aquisition of new weapons and armor and the equipping of various gems you find
you can fuse gems together to create new gems with special powers
but thats pretty much it  no points to spend of any kind
all of your weapons and armor can be purchased from the shop so questing for special weapons and armor is pointless
furthermore all wares have a level requirement so apart from gems theres no good way to max out a particular statshallow and frustrating gameplay elementsyour  espers exist but you can only take one of them into a dungeon with you as opposed to previous games where you do work to find the mana and then its unique powers are available to you through the rest of the game
you cannot access the weapons armor or gems you pick up while youre still in the dungeon or swap out your esper until youve reached a save point
each dungeon has multiple levels and if you leave or die you have to start the dungeon over again or simply restart your game from your save point if you reached one while indungeon
the new gameplay mechanics are not always explained in the best way such that i had to actually look up how to use and switch my espersthe only positivesthere are four weapons that allow you to complete some puzzleaspects in the dungeon and you have the ability to dualwield so you dont have to keep switching weapons which is nice
the graphics are cute  the whole game definitely looks just like a mana game and there are even a few animestyle cutscenes
your performance in each dungeon section is scored off how many monsters you kill how many chests you find and how fast you do it in  and from this you can get special rewards
theres a multiplayer option which is new and supposed to be pretty funthe lowdowni was surprised to find this used so quickly considering it only came out a short while ago but now i see why
by itself any one of these flaws wouldnt be enough to ruin the game but this many annoyances and shortage of rp aspects together make it an almost worthless pursuit
its fine for a dungeon crawl but with so little rewards why not just replay a more compelling dungeon crawl game
i recommend d for solo play and gauntlet zelda four swords or ff crystal chronicles for really fantastic multiplayer dungeoncrawl
and if youre interested in how the mana series is done well on a handheld pick up sword of manai wanted to like this game
in a market swamped by blow up the alien the idea of playing as an alien sounded like a breath of fresh air
even better than just a little role reversal you get to play as the alien trying to blow up the world
and wait its filled with satirical comedy poking fun at the whole genre and era with moments where its brave enough to laugh at itself
i asked how could that go wrongthen the game arrivedthe story is definitely not engrossing
it works enough to get you from point a to point b and the greater story is actually fair but the game is bogged down in everything between the rare moments of actual plot progression
if you want a deep engaging story then try elsewhere
the games greatest success  making fun of the genre and era  is also one of its greatest weaknesses the interesting general idea being pounded into oblivion with bland repetition with all the subtlety of a brick to the facestory graphics can break a game but they cannot make it
this saying holds true here but thankfully the graphics besides the occasional anomaly is one place where the game generally gets it right
the lightning bolt from cryptos appropriately if unimaginatively named zapomatic is fair and closein shots during conversation cinematics do give a reflective mirror illusion to cryptos eyes
its also interesting to see the hexagonalsphere of cryptos shields when hes knocked down to critical healthunfortunately though the general map layouts are interesting beyond cryptos saucer the objects  from humans to vehicles and even buildings to an extent  look plain and blocky particularly the humans
the environments also dont show weapons fire so beyond the hit flash a building will look perfectly healthy until the moment a convenient cloud of dust obscures it sinking into the ground
at least a smudge effect would have been nice
its a shame that each good moment seemed more to highlight something that could have been better rather than just being goodgraphics the sound effects vary from being cheesy the disintegrator gun sounds like somebody shooting spitballs through a straw to appropriate the zap gun does sound like highvoltage energy
the appropriate ones tend to fade into the background while the ones youll notice will end up being the ones that just arent good enough
the voice acting ranges from mediocre to decent and due to the probable comic intention i cant drop the score for linguistic butchering but i would say its neither bad nor goodsound i dont know if it was intentional but with rare exception the only music i recall was cheesy throwbacktothes music that made me grind my teeth
i know it doesnt have a score written by masters like chikayo fukuda and coming after a soundtrack likehackguwould be difficult to do but failing so dismally like this only added to the sense of disappointmentmusic when you start off it looks like you can roam free and do anything you want
then you have to interact
the camera wasnt as bad as some games but i found it a little too sluggish and after having gotten used to the ability to snap the camera to a convenient behind and a nice height above the shoulder from games likeratchet  clank  going commandoorhack gu vol
 rebirthit was almost disorienting to have to manually deal with it here
yes it does automatically come in behind you but it isnt very intelligent about adjusting in the vertical field and you have to go for quite a ways before it will swing around so you can see where youre going
theres also no firstpersonview option though the draw distance and your weapons dont reach far enough for this to be an issueunfortunately targeting is a big issue
before i continue i want to state that i formally hate most console shooters  if im going to have to rapidly deal with people coming at me from multiple directions and varying heights i want to make quick precise movements
a mouse or trackball is perfect for that
ive never yet played a console shooter that didnt feel either too sluggish or sticky overshooting when i wanted to make small adjustments
and that will happen often in this game which is extremely finicky about aiming and wont give you the benefit of the doubt no matter how intense the firefight is getting
there is a lock on option but that is intended for psychic abilities and disrupts firing and i found it to be highly random  often a police officer with a shotgun would run up to me and id move towards him and hold the l to lock on only for it to target a distant policeman coming with a pistol as the one with the shotgun either blew crypto away or gave him a buttstroke to the face either way ending with the irritation of being knocked down and having the lockon broken and without the benefit of the camera centering to show me the action so sometimes ill wonder why crypto isnt shooting and not figure it out until seconds later when the crawling camera reveals that soldier was closer than i thoughti will concede that the idea of upgrading weapons to shields to the jet pack was nice but the difference in performance was negligible and getting the furotech cells necessary to upgrade was an unpleasant hassle whether completing irritating sidequests or jumping over the city rooftops to try to snatch an overly wellhidden one
the lack of being able to turn on a cell detector on the map doesnt help
i thought the saucer would be better but its weaponry was so ineffective i found it better to use the abducto ray to snap up and throw vehicles than to blast them with the meager guns
the cloaking device which one might imagine helpful from running from a situation running out of control doesnt last more than a couple seconds and takes minutes to charge ending up being uselessother reviewers have mentioned that the game is also too easy with dying being nullified by the nearinstantaneous creation of a clone of crypto whenever you die
unfortunately if dying meant game over then youd be seeing that a lot particularly when one of the several requisite big shoot outs occur so i didnt see this as an issuegameplay you can go back to previous areas but besides completing sidequests that are available before you leave the first time or collecting more stock for the gene blender theres really very little reason to return to a previous area thats besides the unskippable flying around in orbit cinematic that you wish theyd have made optional
theres also nothing to be gained by going through the game again  without even intending to i ended up unlocking most of the games bonus features a couple crappy art galleries and the lame music without even trying and by the time i got to the end i didnt want to see if there was anything new in another playthrough
at leastratchet  clank up your arsenaloffered some neat streamlining with its challenge modereplayability the humor this games biggest selling point i found uninspired and crude even before it became aggravatingly repetitive
the process of going out and killing people at point a or escorting people to point b was as maddening as it is in other games  plus the irritation of an uncooperative camera and the same unhelpful targeting as most console shooters
if you love playing shooters on the console you wont have as much an issue with the targeting but if youre not a diehard fan of them youll probably get at least miffed as you struggle through until eventually you come to the end of a game where you say at last
not because it was fun but because now you never have to touch it againoverall if you want a game with action an engrossing story beautiful visuals and breathtaking music tryhack gu vol
 rebirth
if you want a simple action platformer thats also a fairly forgiving shooter that allows you to upgrade your weapons tryratchet deadlocked
this game wont deliver action or sound and its lackluster story and gameplay will leave you saying et call homethis game is not very good
first the controls r very hard to use and the flip and turn around buttons on the touch pad r hard to find when ur looking at the top screen
the graphics r pretty good for the ds but not the best
it is very hard to hold the ds because u r constantly using the touch pad then if u hit it to hard u lose grip of the ds and it falls
now for multiplayer it is sort of fun but u do not unlock anything
the gameplay is also very hard i only made it to the fourth level
not much replay value either
other than multiplayer this game is not worth gettingmy kid played it for a week then he moved on
it was ok but easy to beat and not a chalenge
my kid is let me first say that this game sucks
first the loading in this game is rediculous
it takes  hours to load everything
the story mode is kind of numb and i really hate the fact that you cant buy superstar points in the shop
if youre like me you like to create a lot of characters and if youre like me you like to copy your best superstar then edit the copied one so you can have a new superstar with a good rating
basically you cant change their weight class when creating a new character off a copied one to reset the attributes so you can change them up
the create mode is really lame
the clothing sucks so bad in this game
my best friends name is david and they dont even have that as a superstar calling name when you enter the ring like they did in the last one
last time i checked david is a pretty popular first name
hell its batistas first namelike all wrestling games it does have a degree of fun a very small degree of fun
but this game is really really lame and i find it hard to believe that people are saying its a turning point in smackdown history
how the hell do you figure
seriously
did you ever play the other games
you cant sit there and say its the best of the smackdown games because if you do you must have never played another smackdown gamethe heights in this game are all off
i put a wrestler at  and he was as tall as angle angle is 
i have played every wwe game and have been a fan of the wwe wwf since the early s
this game sucks plain and simple
they rushed it
just like mortal kombat armageddonif you feel like wasting  bucks then get it otherwise stick with  or just wait until this one is cheaper due to people bringing it back and selling it used which probably wont be too much longeri have played the raw vs smackdown series casually since it first came out
for me the biggest issue is always playability and i enjoy the casual matches withagainst friends much more than the season modes
that having been said im sorry to say that this years version of the game is not one ill be looking to buy
here are some reasons whylong and frequent loading screens  the amount of load time is just ridiculouspoor animationglitches in some of the moves  many inring moves frequently glitch
your character may be lying on the mat in the middle of the ring when suddenly he disappears and reappears lying in the corner
lack of smooth animation is a major problem for me especially given todays technologysome of the matches are less fun  i miss the weapons in hell in a cell mode and hate having to use a special move to win a table match rather than just putting my opponent on it getting on the turnbuckle and jumping on top of him to break the tablemundane and repetitive announcing  the announcers comments seem random and are repeated ad nauseum
its very annoyingthe musica minor problem though given all the time spent at a loading screen its quite annoying but the music is awfulthats not to say the game is without its merits
while im still getting used to the new control system i can see the need for such a change
i like some of the old superstars that can be unlocked and enjoy some of the new animations and moves
still i buy games for playability and in this respect s vs r  is a big disappointment
when you get together with a group of friends to play the new game and end up throwing in one of the older versions because its more fun to play you know theres a problem with the franchise
this more than anything else tells me this years smackdown vs raw leaves much to be desiredso what changed since smackdown here comes the pain good more things to do fast grapple attack graphics is waaay better there is voice actinggood lot of old superstars hulk hogan the rock  mandkind steve austinbad you cant save tag team partner when he is in opponents submission hold although you can try to hit or catch him
result as if you try to hit ghostbadyou can find a pattern how to beat opponent and use it during whooole game
mick foley is character i tried game with  just use right analog and tilt left and then punch opp
head
it is also easy  too easy to irish whip to corner ldiagonalrx and then just suplex them off the top ropebad you need to work a lot to unlock hulk rock and other interesting guysi just tried the game and thats it too repetitive folks fortunately we rented this one before we bought it
the concept behind the game is fine
plenty of nonviolent puzzle solving activities but it did not peg our fun meter
the wii interface developed for this game is pretty flawed
for instance there is a critical task where you have to activate a wench by twirling the wiimote in the air
spongebob is told to crank hard and fast which his animated character does
however it only works if the player twirls it very slowly
driving games feel pretty awkward too
animation and graphics are only soso
as a whole the game lacks polish
i think most adults would be bored by the game and it wont maintain the attention of a younger audience for long it certainly did not capture the interest of my kids who are fans of the cartoon
i considered giving this threestars but for the price i think we should expect more from the game developersheres a game which attempts to exploit itself as a revolutionary sequel to the previous games
it boasts this because istead of using the usual o button to initiate a grapple on your opponent you use the right thumb stick
the revolutionary changes in gameplay are basically that the thumbstick instead of the o buttonevery wrestling game is only as marketable as its story mode is enthrallingthis one has several amusing chapters you can run through but their appeal cant outshine the level of annoyance one will have to endure when attempting to complete certain tasks
in order to achieve the royal rumble trophy and unlock certain locked wrestlers you must compete in the royal rumble match and not the actual royal rumble ppv as the world champion or contender to the world championship
the royal rumble pay per view isnt encountered until very late in the game so you wont realize this until youve already invested a good days worth of game playingas with most xbox  games this one goes out of its way to achieve unique forms of irratating stupidity
one case of this is where you would like to quit and reload a saved game since you are not satisfied with the result of a particular match
if you quit while the game is still playing it will automatically save your unwanted results
youll have to then start season mode from the very beginning
the idiots at microsoft felt that the gamer must have obviously forgotten to save the game and instead of putting up a notice they decided to just put up an autosave and negate the need for a save button
they could have just set the autosave feature to save right after a match since youd have to turn the console off completely to escape the consequencethis game is a terrible example of a sequel
id recommend that fans of the series just wait for the next one where they will hopefully improve upon this already stale concept enough to where it will seem like a real sequel to raw vs smackdown cmon i tried to come up with that title pun for about five minutesits been almost  months since a new pokemon game came out
pokemon emerald that last game wasnt an allnew adventure but it featured a few new touches to the same old pokemon formula and that kept fans playing the game
so much time has passed and pokemon fans like me were left wondering when theyd be able to feed that pokemon craving
nintendo creatures and game freak let chunsoft take the reins and the product was the multiplatform pokemon mystery dungeon series
that last statement is quite possibly the knife in the back of this years only new pokemon release pokemon mystery dungeon in both the rescue team red gba version and the rescue team blue ds version is a repetitive game that lacks the life charm energy and fun of the rest of the games in the evergrowing pokemon franchisein pokemon mystery dungeon you assume the role of a humanturnedpokemon
what pokemon you are depends on your answers of a few personalitybased questions at the start of the game
the twist here is that there are no humans in this pokemon land and you communicate with other pokemon to partake in rescue missions throughout the land
sadly few of the pokemon have anything interesting to say that doesnt pertain to rescue missions so the game feels like a linear affair
take rescue missions beat rescue missions and repeat the process until the games over and you can go to some of the secret and more dangerous dungeonsthe dungeons themselves are extremely boring
i absolutely hated them
theyre big randomlygenerated maps with freelyroaming and constantlyrespawning wild pokemon to battle
you can find items and traps throughout the dungeon as well but thats very generic for the randomdungeon rpg genre
the random designs dont include any sort of interesting environmental attributes so youre mostly running down hallways and looking for the stairway to the next floor of the dungeon
as the game progresses the dungeons get bigger but never better
after a very short while i just started looking for the exit to each floor as quickly as possible which made leveling up a difficult thing to dothe battle gameplay is very similar to other pokemon games but its all done in a touchy realtime system
youll run up to monsters select an attack and wait for the opponent to die before moving onto the next one
unfortunately since this game has freelyroaming enemies it is possible to get surrounded by enemies which makes everything even more frustrating
the battles arent fun and with each wild pokemon i found i simply wanted to move on as quickly as possible
since you cant capture pokemon youre not a trainer after all there is almost no fun to be had while battling monsters in this game
youll get more pokemon on your team as you go through the game and there are specific areas where certain pokemon can join your team but you wont be able to catch and raise them as you please
there is some depth to developing your rescue team
for example you can change their ai iq and battle settings
because of this cpucontrolled pokemon can interact with the environment and different situations in a more intelligent fashion
this doesnt make the battle system any more interesting though ultimately making pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team a sickening dud when it comes to gameplaygetting to a game over screen has never been okay in a pokemon game but pokemon mystery dungeon takes that frustration to a whole new level if you die every single item in your item inventory toolbox is lost and you must restart the dungeon from the very beginning
this makes the repetitive generic dungeons even more frustrating to get through and the dull battles even dullervisually pokemon mystery dungeon rescue team is a gba game at heart
ds owners will be very disappointed with the basic sprites horribly dull environments and lackluster attack animation
the only saving grace visually is the art which is quite nice
the sound effects are as generic as they have been since pokemon blue and red and the music is less catchy and more annoyingfans of random dungeon hacks might find a little to enjoy here since pokemon mystery dungeon is a very generic random dungeon hackandslash rpg
but pokemon fans should tough it out and wait for pokemon pearl and pokemon diamond to come out next year because pokemon mystery dungeon is like nothing youve played before and its nothing interesting either
there are so many better gba games out there and so many better ds games coming out that dropping  for either version of pokemon mystery dungeon is a waste of your hardearned cashnot that great
its just hit and miss strategy
the game isnt all that fun
other than that i was delivered really fast
great conditon
no damage
played greatthe truth is i really wanted to like this game
i really did
its all because the pokemon rpgs of the past have been good
the craze for the red and blue versions and then the far superior gold and silver versions arguably the best of the lot
then ruby and sapphire came along
all these rpgs were simple yet for some reason delightful to play
now pokemon mystery dungeon red and blue come out and it seems i had my hopes up for this one
its no where near as interesting and its even sadder that even on the nintendo ds the game just didnt go above and beyondthe basic premise of the story is like every pokemon game rather simple
youre an aspiring trainer who one day falls asleep only to wake up as a pokemon
the pokemon you wake up as depends on how you answer the questions at the start of the new game
youll also be able to choose a pokemon partner who will be the one that awakens you
you and your partner will find yourself in a world completely full of pokemon
unfortunately all is not safe
you and your ally will soon discover that other pokemon are always in need of help in this new world
so its up to you to answer ditress calls of other pokemon go to the specified dungeon and save them
its basic
its simple
and throughout your journey you wont see one trainer
eversince there are no trainers one has to wonder how to expand upon their party
well you still get new pokemon from the wild as you did before but its slightly different
when you defeat a wild pokemon they will offer to join your team
learning moves however is almost exactly the same as previous games
by leveling and through tms
you can also team up and perform moves as wellall these things are really engrossing and theyve got some neat things going for it but it doesnt separate from the things you begin to notice as you trek through the game
the first being that most of the game is just boring
the dungeon floors are randomly generated and sometimes the exit will be right next to the entrance
although thats not such a bad thing when battling is a fairly uneventful task anyway
the ai of your allies is horrible yet they can still hold their own in a battle against an enemy
even bosses are easily taken down by your partythe worst part may very well be that the true core of the gameplay doesnt come out until youve completed the main story
more abilities become available after
youre finally able to take control of other pokemon after
your pokemon also wont evolve until you complete the main storywhat would a pokemon game be without two versions
theres the blue version which is on the nintendo ds and then the red version which is on the gba
dont be fooled however
theyre basically the same game
just like every other set of pokemon games though each version has exclusive pokemonthe saving grace of this set up however is all the connectivity features that can be done
if you insert both games into your ds at a time you can import pokemon from one game to another
this is an easy way to get all of them
its also really neat that you can trade items missions and pokemon this way
in addition if you get kod in a dungeon and your party gets wiped out you could send out a message to your friend and heshe will have to come and rescue you
the connectivity features are very engrossing
and of course you can hook up via wireless for ds owners or link cable gba owners and battle with your friendspokemon mystery dungeon doesnt really look all that great
its no surprise pokemon games never look fantastic graphically
if you want to know the truth the ds version looks exactly like the gba version
theres hardly any difference between them
the game is certainly colorful but theres just not enough variety in the environments and there are hardly any d effects brought out
for the nintendo ds which has to compete with far better looking games its really hard for it to hold its own hereworse than the graphics is the sound though
a lot of the sound effects and such come directly from the normal gameboy games that are almost ten years old
the music itself isnt so bad but it is quite repetitive
again however its no surprise because as usual pokemon games dont usually push a system to its limitsits hard to suggest pokemon mystery dungeon
its a pokemon game but its a rather bland pokemon game
its neat that you can finally play as a pokemon but the game as a whole couldve been presented far better than it actually was
theres little variety to it actually which is really sad considering how big and expansive previous pokemon games are
its got plenty of rescue missions but after a while theyre much more repetitive than exciting
i cant suggest one buy this
even the most die hard of pokemon fans will have trouble getting into this gameon the positive sideyou actually play as the pokemon and not the trainertheres plenty of connectivity stuff to be done between both versions mastering the game as a whole will take a really long timetheres never an end to rescue missions even long after youve completed the story modeon the negative sidebattles are too easythe ai for your enemies and allies are bad yet the game is still easy and your ai controlled characters are still competent enough to get through the battle without youmost of the more interesting tweaks of the game are available only after story mode is completegraphically the game doesnt hold upthe sound effects are absolutely terribleive come to a conclusion about just causethey decided that theyre going to make everything so massive that people wont notice the little things
there is an array of tanks to choose from not to mention a huge amount of cars planes helicopters boats spanning the spectrum of each type of vehicle
yet when you crash these with exceptions of midair collisions it doesnt feel real at all
thats not to mention that the map may be huge but it might as well be exactly the same
i read in a magazine that if the map for just cause were the size of your hand the map of san andreas would be the size of your thumbnail but the map for san andreas is loaded with so many more goodies than this map which is a few large cities which are completely uninteractive lots of forest and the occasional rural village which unsurprisingly looked just like the last one and the people are exactly the same
coincidence
i think notnow there are some redeeming features to the game
first of all something which i have seen no game do with the exception of racing games themselves is that just cause shows a difference between torque and horsepower
the vampire will go up a hill the fukada tournament cant but conversely cannot go as fast in a straight line
this would of course be more beneficial if i still wanted to play the gameanother bright spot was the ability to do stunts though youll quickly learn they arent particularly exhilarating after a while and that they become more useful as a quicker means of transportationthen there is something which really killed me about this game which i think the developers were both conscious of and were aware of just how obnoxious it was which was the americanismthe way one suave latino man dressed in all black with the help of an army clad woman whos always in a bathing suit and his boss dressed in a hawaiian shirt can topple a dictatorship
not to mention the united states took it upon themselves to do so
oh and they decided to destroy anything that stood in there way
but thats not enough they had to cause a thermonuclear meltdown on one of the islands
greatso maybe its just me and this game has its value in the area of cheap thrills but call me stupid i wouldnt buy this again given the opportunity to make that choice againi bought this game for  bucks plus tax and now i feel like i was ripped off
i played the game for maybe about an hour and have never picked it back up
im a little disappointed
its like a crappy blurry version of gta except in the bahamaslots of cool stuff to ride on
but it doesnt seem like you could ever die
it feels like the game is made for a little kid
the aiming is pretty much done for you yet the ability to drive just plain sucksnot even worth stealingyou want to talk about a disappointment
the playstation  is supposed to show off amazing graphical improvements compared to the ps and yet this sonic game doesnt do anything at all to show off the consoles supposed amazing poweralso this game is pretty bad because the trademark of sonic the hedgehog is supposed to be speed and yet hes slower than ever in this game
also the levels are pretty tough and the controls arent anywhere near as good as the old sonic games on the sega genesis
a rushed game with mistakes all over the place that should be avoidedi have to say that when i first put this game in my ps that my disappointment was immediate
the graphics for what one would expect on the ps are very underwhelming
after playing games like call of duty  and seeing some of what ps is capable of it is very disappointing to see ps level at best graphics in a game that costs the same as call of duty  the initial levels are boring and dull and do not suck you into the game at all
the initial cut scene is beautiful and gets your hopes up only to dash them moments later
ps games like god of war had much better graphics
i am very disappointed so far with what sony sega and other software firms have offered for ps
after screwing up the launch i thought for sure that they would be looking to gain back some momentum by releasing strong graphically beautiful titles that harness the power of the machine but not so far at least not with sonic the hedgehog
i recommend you skip this one at least until the price comes down a lotsega has been doing okay with their recent games except shadow the hedgehog but this game is just a disapointment running around the city is bland and  poorly made the levels on the other hand look pretty good the problem is this game is probably buggier than the original sonic adventurethough i did love that gameand you move slower big problem in a sonic game and shadow and silver both are basically just thrown in shadow runs really weird and silvers powers dont really function great which ends up being annoying
ive run through the floor the camera stopped following me homing attack through big enemies etcmany many times the game doesnt function welli really was looking forward to this game i still play all of my older sonic games heck i own triples of most of the games but this one was just a headache
the videos in sonics story were beautifully done and looked great though it felt like sonic fantasy and seemed weird but really its just a game to avoid
the absolute worst thing about this game is its slower than any other sonic game for  a game that is supposed to be about speed and claims to be faster this one is a disappointment
i had a bit of fun but sold my copy inside a monthi must agree with many of the other reviewers
i purchased this because i thought it would be fun for a freind and i to play sonic like the good old days
well i was horribly shocked to find that this has the great graphics and speed of sonic when it is not loading and the controls are awful to use here
the camera angle keeps wanting to go straigh above the character when you start to run making it at times impossible to see where your shooter is that is killing you
it really makes the game difficult to enjoy because you are always stopping and tilting the camera
it is possible to make progress but there is a steep learning curve
not recommended for young users because it is so tough to hold your attention haing to stop the action all the time to adjust
im glad i got it at  original cost
good luck in gaming but skip this one even if you really like sonicokay i will tell it like this if youre a real sonic fan you will find some fun factors in this game but i mean some
there are some objective in the game where you need to help civilians and loading time does take long but if youre a patient and i mean patient you will get through it i honestly dont hate this game cause i actually do play it at times like probably  times in a month after i beat the game completly
only reason why cause the running stages are pretty enjoyable
and if your a fan of shadow hes pretty cool in this game
i never got into silve so much but i love the blaze what will you hate in this game the battle with silver you need to accomplish like you will hate it when he uses his powers and bangs you on the wall consitently and you keep picking up your rings you just say to yourself you rather die then hearing silver say its no use and take this over and over and over again it just doesnt end
the princess elis idea and not crying kind of threw me off i rather wanted the princess to be like an animal like a princess hedgehog from ancient times if you get what im saying although the cutscenes are really really beautifl
the phrases in the action stages sound stupid from time to time like he would speed into a cave and say like oh im going into the cave and in crysis city he would see the fire and say like  oh that fire is big just like the writer who was writing the voice scrypts obviously did a bad job or was lazy i still remember the sayings in sonic adventure   heroes shadow the hedgehog but i will not compare this game to those games its totally a different game
and with glitches theres too many but if you find amusement in glitches this game wont bother you like i found my amusement in this glitches like it made me laughso basically i base it off like a  ratio cause i am a sonic fan but this was really poor work with limited amount of fun in the game but there are some things in the game that will make you enjoy it
so if you can rent it or but it for really cheep like  bucks than go for iti wasnt was i was expecting for this game
last time ive played was when i had a segacdi read the reviews but i thought id still try it
it coulnt be that bad
heres the bad i found sonic kind of freezes up waiting for tails to catch up
theres just too many long loading times in the same level
for any activity theres a loading time
the characters and town look boxy
its not rd generation
it looks sega genesis qualityyou have to talk to pretty much every character in town
and most of them tell you useless crapi was a huge fan of sonic in the genesis days but any d version has been a dissapointment and this game is no different
the camera has been the biggest issue and the trend continues for this one
speed is sonics gig and they just havent figured out a way to mesh that with a d world but they are getting closer
there were parts that showed promise but it still doesnt make it a good game
playable for only the most hardcore sonic fansi have recently been considering getting myself a psp
my friend came over today and apparently brought his along so i decided to play it
more specifically i played this game
being a fan of sonics handheld escapades i was hoping this would be an at least decent play
oh dear god was i wrongthe plot revolves around dr eggman having built a device that turns things intocards
of all the things you can of they went with cards
even more nonsensically sonics friends and the master emerald
have been turned into cards and were kidnapped by eggman
then we have shadow knuckles and a hedgehog from the future named silver sonic  is erased from being canon after all join in on all this
its all silly in a dumb way reallythe gameplay is played on a d plane and focuses on having to race against the aforementioned characters to reach the finish line at the end of each level
there are  zones with  acts and a boss in each
its kinda like the vs mode in some of the portable sonic games on the nintendo ds and sonic generations ds
however there are multiple powerstraps you can use against your opponent and vice versa
theres also a special power the character can use on himself
for example sonic can boost for a momentwhile it would sound kinda neat the levels are structured horribly
i feel sorry for dimps because the companys usually been criticized for putting in dash pads and springs in their sonic games
well this games not by dimps and these levels contain more dash pads and springs ive seen in any other sonic game
even when there are no springs or pads in sight although there are a few multiple routes to take the structure of these levels is super linear and you get absolutely no time to explore because you have to race against completely stubborn ai
one level crystal mountain act  left me with frustration to no end and part of why is because of freaking silver who seems to constantly gather traps to use on me
on the contrary the last zone meteor base left me with total relief because i do not race anyone but rather a time limit that gives me enough time to finish the actsthe bosses are nothing special
they are moreorless played in a similar manner to the bosses in the nintendo ds sonics
the catch here however is that you for some reason have to race against an opponent to see who can beat the boss faster
fortunately unlike the actual levels the ai here is pathetic so you do not have to worry about not beating the boss fast enough that much
meanwhile the final boss feels more like a massively uninspired level instead of a bossoverall this is just a miserable excuse for a sonic game let alone a portable one considering how the handheld series has always had great offerings
the tragically simplified and linear d racing can only be fun for so long and the game as a whole is just plain underwhelmingphantasy star universe is truly a amazing universe but there are some major flaws in this game
one of these that is truly annoying is that there are chapters in this game
what i mean by chapters is that at the end of a level it ends like a cartoon show and gives you a preview of the next one
also the single most horrible flaw with this game is that you have to pay for online
if you have this for the xbox  you already pay for your online capabilities but these guys want you to pay more and its alot more
its  dollars more to get on and get insulted constantly by a bunch of nerds
if you want to play online in this game get the demo for it because it is free
if this game didnt have horrible voice acting chapter endings and previews loading screens that constantly pop up and a online fee it could have been a great game
i would recomend renting it for a weekend to get the achievements from it which are way too easy and then returning it and forgetting you ever played itsega noticed the raw power of the new consolessega made sonic a popular face on the xbox  and ps
going back to old school
welljust back to sonic adventure
sega thought this would be great
wellgameplay and controllsthe gameplay is not the best while the level design is horrid
the controlls are wacky and do not respondcamera and graphicsthis game has a camera that is controlled by a baby or not having a camera at all
way to many flipoutsmusicthis is why the game is  stars the music is okay but some tracks are pretty badreeplayibillity and difficultythere is no replays on this one because the game is so bad you will not finish it
the difficulty in this game is mean
bad enemy placements and controls that are bad make this game impossible almostwhy i hate this so muchone word glithches
there are unlimited glitches in this and story is so bad it is a glitchverdictonly by it if you do not know what is going on in your life
 out of  um nojust a warning for all  of you that dont know the game is absolutely terrible
its a badly designed glitchy mess with a plot that is downright laughable
however when you buy it with the intentions i had which was for it to be somewhat of a trial by fire then it is a worthwhile purchase
i recommend that you only buy this if you are a fan of the series who wants to see it at its lowest point discounting sonic labyrinth because no one cares about the game gear then by all means go in
it has great music almost on par with colors nowhere near as good as adventure but still great it has some pretty enjoyable level design and the plot can deliver some laughs from how bad it is
just make sure you know what youre doing before you buy thisi saw this game on demo in best buy last year just before i bought my xbox   considering i loved the dreamcast version so much when they made it in d and ive enjoyed several of the sonic games on my daughters gamecube i was excited about this game and told my wife i wanted it for christmas between call of duty  and sonic i would buy whichever one she didnt get for me
how can you not like sonicimagine my disappointment once i started playing this game
wow
i had no idea it was going to be this bad
the game looks great and plays fast but thats about all
just about everything else is wrong and sonic team should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such an inferior product
giving this game  stars is generous but i wont give it one star because it is fun in short spurts and couldve been so much better so much potential gone to waste
by far the most annoying thing about this game is all the cheap deaths from bad camera angles you just cant see where youre going far too often and thats just unacceptable
combine that with the limited save opportunities where you most assuredly will run out of lives and the game is unnecessarily difficult
not even difficult in a rewarding way like ninja gaiden difficult in a cheap frustrating wayit was hard to do and i really didnt want to give up on this game but i ended up selling it to gamestop not too long ago for whatever theyd give me
lesson learned  check reviews before buying which i did not i banked on it being good
whoops
that was  bucks my wife couldve spent on something elseunless you are a diehard sonic fan avoid this game at all costs
if you are a diehard then be very careful i would definitely suggest renting this first because i honestly dont believe its worthy of inclusion in the sonic seriesthe hotly anticipated sonic the hedgehog game for the xbox  and playstation  was intended to celebrate the blue blurs th anniversary
thats probably why it was called sonic the hedgehog instead of sonic adventure  as anticipated as it was though it was incredibly rushed in development and the result was arguably one of the worst sonic games ever produced
not the worst game of all time of course but this was still unbelievably badsonic the hedgehog follows the formula of the first sonic adventure pretty closely
unfortunately its taken the worst of that game to the freaking max
seriouslydont be surprised if you spend a good chunk of time wandering around the uninspired and bleak hub worlds just so you can get to the next level or mission
absolutely nothing sticks out in these hub worlds
you just see samey looking buildings and whatever youre looking for is moreorless hidden beneath all the monotony the hub worlds offeractually monotony plays a semibig role as one of the games many major problems
levels occasionally pit your character against enemies that youre forced to fight to move on
the problem is that you dont have many attacks to work with to kill them causing you to perform the same attacks over and over again which can become quite repetitive especially since the homing attack sonic  shadows main means of midair attack is slightly delayed every time you use it unlike how you could freely spam it in the adventure gamesadmittedly the levels can feature some pretty decent level design as there are indeed some multiple routes and crannies hidden in secret areas similarly to the classic sega genesis sonics
unfortunately theres so much frustration and annoyances thrown into the levels as well
accompanying the monotony i described earlier is confusing navigation
sometimes youll be likely to wander around the level not knowing where to progress next
and since the camera is also a technical enemy to fight off dont be surprised if it doesnt give you a good view of anything at certain pointssonic the hedgehog is divided into three campaigns  a final story segment that you unlock after completing the three
these campaigns have you play as sonic shadow and newcomer from the future silverplayers that have played the sonic adventure games may be somewhat familiar with how the game plays but otherwise would remain puzzled as to what odd changes were made to the mechanics for this gamesonics speed has been drastically reduced for this game
some may see that as a good thing but it doesnt help matters when the only instances of actual speed in the game are through the automation of dash pads and springs
its still pretty fortunate that theres a giant emphasis on legit platforming action
too bad you cant even jump on enemies anymore
nope
youre forced to use the delayed homing attack
granted getting the bounce bracelet upgrade or leg sweeping can help at times but in the end it really wouldnt have killed sonic team to allow you to jump on enemies
imagine if you cant jump on goombas in a mario platformerthe highlight of sonics journey is the ability to purchase unfinished gem powerups from the shop very later in the game
by unfinished i mean that you can abuse the everloving crap out them
and weve got some pretty sweet powers coming from these gems
one gem behaves like a grappling hook another lets sonic boost and one more allows sonic to jump infinitely
this is why you dont rush your game developmentshadow plays a little similarly to sonic except its even more tedious to use the homing attack because now this dudes combatorientated meaning he has to perform a few kicks in midair if you wanna bash down baddies with health bars
shadow also doesnt get to use the gems and instead has to deal with carrying around utterly useless chaos powers until the final boss in the campaignfor one reason or another shadow also has to be sporting vehicles in several of his stages and their control feels rather sloppy and some things you have to do with these vehicles ask for excessive precision ex when you have to shoot down dr eggmans train while on a motorcyclesilvers play mechanics bring in a bunch of new things to the table
for example he packs a little technique called psychokinesis and he uses it to throw things at enemies
its actually kinda fun to play around with and its not too shabby to have the ability to fly for a few seconds
just wait til you have to try to pick up enemies themselves though
youll have a rough time doing that because the hit detection absolutely sucks
and dont even get me started on the infamous ball puzzle in one level which requires you to use your psychokinesis on a metallic ball a limited amount of times so it can be thrown into the last of bunches of holes
if you fail here the ball explodes and respawns back to start
it is much much easier said than doneif playing as these three hedgehogs wasnt enough to satisfy your needs the game also unnecessarily and abruptly switches your character to another every once in a suspiciously long while
these characters only appear exclusive to one hedgehogs campaign
tails fox guy  knuckles red guy make their appearances in sonics campaign omega robot guy and rouge supposedly a bat are playable in shadows campaign and blaze cat thing and amy sonicobsessed fangirl are in silvers campaign
each of these characters despite not appearing that much at all bring in some of their own unique tricks and problemstails plays almost like he did in sonic adventure except much worse
his weight actuallyevery characters weight for that matter can never stay put

his tedious attack

eesh

this girl has also borrowed mechanics from sonic adventure and they too have worsened here

however this robot also has a hovering move that can be easily abused thanks to how it cancels all vertical momentum
just repeatedly mash the a button and exploreperhaps the most infamous topic this game has fallen under is physics and how badly the game fails at capturing them
sonic can stand upsidedown on loopdeloops and you can make blocks fly and drown in sand
theres nothing more that needs to be said other than you may as well watch some youtube videos of people finding hilarious oddities like these all the timethe huge lack of polish can also be seen within the games multiple missions that you can access via the boring hub worlds
they often consist of enemy sprees orange rings etc but there seriously isnt that much of a variety
some idiotic ones include that one mission where you have to guess who the commander is who is the first person you speak to and the three trials
oh dear lord the three trialsthank god you only have to play a couple of these godforsaken missionsi think this review has gone long enough for you to get the point im trying to make this game is really really bad
theres a bit of fun to be had but those moments are so incredibly far and few betweenill be quick about this game since there isnt much to talk aboutpros sonics levels are well designed except for mach speed sectionsenvironments are gorgeousmusic is great sonic games always had great musicshadows story is interesting but not fully fleshed outcons a fair amount of glitches some forcing me to restart the levelloading screens in very unnecessary moments each loading screen can actually last up to around  seconds if the game is not installedsonics story is very weakelise is very ugh in terms of charactershadows gameplay is terrible if you liked shadow the hedgehogs gameplay you might like itsilvers story and gameplay is the combination of what is wrong with sonics and shadows gameplayvarious camera issues that can kill you offplay the game if you want to see why its so infamous
but even then its not worth more than 
i gave it  stars because i see that they tried with this game but they had unreasonable deadlines which forced their hand to release this game in a second beta testlike state
the music is definitely worth getting the ost for thoughfull auto  is a huge disappointment esp
since its a sega game and i expected so much more
i had played the original xbox exclusive full auto and it was a total disaster
full auto  exclusive to the ps is a much improved version but overall its still a crappy gamefirst the graphics is poor for a ps game and for the price
the cars have no details and the environment inadequately rendered
it really feels like a ps game that was just halfheartedly dressed upsecond and more devastating is the laughable car physics
the vehicles just feel weightless and ridiculously unreal
when you are racing you dont feel like you are racing at all
its almost as if you werent even controlling your car
the physics here is the worst ive seen in a racer in a long time only the original full auto was worsebecause you can shoot at your opponents when youre driving theres so some fun factor to this game especially for a couple of hours in the beginning
ultimately this game falls far short of its potentials just like the original for the x
it just sucksi loved the first full auto and beat it probably  or  times over the years
its quick and fun and doesnt require too much thought
im not sure what happened in this game
a few of the levels seem completely ripped off from the first one
obviously you want a sequel to be in the vein of the one you liked
what i didnt want was a copy cat
the cars are like tanks and the bullets like nerf gunstime to put this away and go dig out an old chestnutif you want to play bubble bobble on the go then fortunately enough for you revolution has the original arcade classic included
the game is just as fun to play as ever and it even allows you to link up to another ds for the coop multiplayer that made the game a hit
for those of you unfamiliar with bubble bobble its a simple arcade platformer where you shoot bubbles to trap enemies and then pop them
its kind of like how you hit enemies from underneath and then kick them over in mario bros except bubble bobbles enemies are dealt with more instantlywhile the original game is unharmed though the new edition included that hurts
badlyas soon as you start the game youll be immersed in the lush sprites and scenery but youll almost immediately leave for the utter unfairness that are the enemies
have you ever wanted to play a bubble bobble game where the main enemy type in the game shoots projectiles quickly
i sure havent
even worse the levels take up more than the whole screen so you cant even see some of the enemies or have enough reaction time
if you do manage to wobble your way through the perilous levels and equally perilous boss battles youll eventually make it to level  where the boss doesnt appear causing the game to give up
oh yeah did i forget to mention theres no coop here tooi love the show and love video games so i have been waiting for years to play this game but didnt have a pci bought it when i got a notebook computer but am massively disappointed that it wont play on my computer
it meets all the qualifications except the video card
this game needs a nivida video card and wont even install without one
amazon really should include all the minimums your computer needs to have to actually play the gamemy daughter urged me to return it but im hanging on to it in hopes of getting a better computer or if possible im no computer geek so i dont even know if it is update or install the video cardi am bummed out
the game looks fun as hell from reading the book
i wish there was a ps versiongod of war  was a semifun game that became a lot less fun to me after i ran into a bug getting trapped in one level
i quit after an hour or so of trying to figure out what the hell to dogod of war  is luckily bugfree
but i had to consult a walkthrough about  times and i hate that
what happened to the good old days when walkthroughs werent even an option and it didnt matter because you didnt need them
now more and more games put in incredibly annoying puzzles
well i dont like puzzles
if i wanted puzzles i could go play a puzzle game
too bad god of war takes the path of halflife   interspersing the fun cool action with lame annoying puzzlesanyway i solved some of the puzzles some i looked up online and by the time i reached a place i didnt know what to do jumping on a rock that i couldnt get past because of a huge lava pit i quit this game
god of war s strengh is in its action so why does it insist on putting so many obstacles in the way of getting to the action
it makes no sense reallyalso i found the flying levels to be mostly a bore
i dont think this game should focus on flying it should focus on what its good at  earthbound action
its obviously taken a lot of inspiration from ninja gaiden and thats cool but no way would i rate it as highly as ninja gaiden
unfortunately im the only one willing to talk about the negative aspects of this game because gamers think the graphics are ohsokool  and they are great for a ps game but there are problemsthis doesnt deserve the star trek name
the real tragedy is that with a bit more playtesting and polish this could have been a good game
however someone thought that frustrating repetitive gameplay might be funon the good side the game looks nice for a yearold ps game
the shiptoship battles are actually fun in an arcadey kind of way there are a good number of missions  and the skirmish mode is okay for a little while
the campaign story was all over the place and didnt make sense in some instances
but there was a good spread of enemies and missions over the various eras and you get to fly the different federation ships
i even liked the music and they got william shatner to narrate the mission introsnow the bad parts
where to start
many of the missions are very frustrating
even the tutorial missions yeah the one with the rings are super annoying
the average player will end up redoing some mission objectives dozens of times before successfully completing them
and generally its the same kind of bad missions fly through these rings follow those warp trails escort that weak ship beat the timer wash rinse  repeat
its just poor level design and really should not have passed the qualitycontrol people at besthesda
the game becomes a chore really quickly and i found that i could only take it in small doses before playing something else
its really a shame since the star trek license should be a good starting point for coming up with decent games
i really do hope that bethesda has given up the license
they have thoroughly abused it with games like encounters and star trek legacy star trek conquest is pretty good though simplisticone major warning if you have an older ps like me there is a good chance that you will not even be able to play this game out of the box
for some silly reason the game is on a cd instead of a dvd
i got it to run by tweaking my ps which required opening it up and adjusting the spindel that controls the height of the disk
theres a good guide at 
ultimately the game is not worth the effortif you could take all the excitment of controlling a powerful starship on the edge of human knowledge and put it into a video game it would be the oposite of thisi gave up on this game after the second level of fly the ship to the destination points in timelamemaybe im missing something but i did not enjoy this gameto rate star trek encounters is real simplei paided  for ityou get what you pay forits ok for a quick game of shootem upbut like the reviews for its big brotherstar trek legacydeveloper should spent more time instead of try to put it out for the holidayshoping for a sequeland maybe hopefully theyll do it gta styleopen spacedo what you want to doand just focus on one eratostngdsvoyand entbeing a diehard star trek fan these days isnt easy
especially when it comes to the video game department
i wanted to like this game
really i did
but it just doesnt deliver
or rather it delivers all right a steaming pile
lets call it like it is folks
this game is a stinkerwhat can i add that has not already been said
the controls are bad
the instruction manual is wrong
the commands are glitchy
the camera is screwed up
half your command controls are meaningless
the ship point purchase system doesnt work right
you cant command other ships to do anything meaningful
you have to micromanage each ships repairs in the middle of combat because the ai
is too stupid to do it on its own
your ship bounces off of planets like nerf balls
or worse all your ships get stuck on them when you are trying to make them warp somewherewas this game even beta tested at allwhat else
oh yeah the explosions look terrible
like a few giant pieces of legos split in half
you cant save anywhere
if you die at the end of a mission you have to repeat the entire mission over again
the game is repetitive simply consisting of keeping the enemy in your sights firing phasers until their shields are down then firing photon torpedoes over and over
it features a bunch of the muchhated protect this wimpy vessel missionsthere is no complexity or strategy to the game whatsoever
most of your mental abilities will be spent trying to get your ship going in the right direction
or getting your controls to do what the manual says they are supposed to doive said it before but it is worth repeating
this game features the worst controls i have ever seen in any game
ever
good luck trying to figure them out while the camera is going crazy on you and your ships are all warping the wrong way
or while the enemy is hammering the medical vessel you are supposed to be protecting and you are trying to figure out how to get one of your other ships to repair itselfhaving said all that the game does have a few fun moments
it is simplistic and repetitive sure
but sometimes it does have a certain charm to it
thats probably just my inner trekker talking
the gamer within me says no  stay far far awayi give this game props for the look of the ships which they nailed
the sound effects and some of the combat visuals are also good
the music is alright
and they did manage to get all the top captains from the shows to lend their voices here
apparently spending  of their development budget in doing so by the looks of the result
so there are a few good things
but thats pretty much itthe story is throwaway
personally i dont care about the story anyway
still it is odd
the game doesnt have any cut scenes to speak of
all voice work consists of voiceovers done while the camera pans over the ships floating in space
this is the cheap way for the programmers to do it but it sure doesnt feel very trekish
star trek needs to have captains on the bridge people onscreen talking to each other
this sorry excuse for a game has none of thatfor the xbox version we also get a bunch of achievements with that tackedon feeling
good luck getting them all since theres a bunch of them that depend on the multiplayer
i cant even review that part of the game because it looks like no one online plays thissome have said this game feels rushed or unfinished
i agree
but worse this game feels completely broken
a lot of the central concepts of this game simply do not work
somewhere along the line the developers should have realized this and gone back to the drawing boardthats my reviewso star trek legacy
yeah buy it if you are a die hard fan  like me
i dont regret the purchase
after all its about all weve got to choose from these days
just dont set your expectations very high and you wont be disappointedi was given this game by a friend who didnt like itnow ive never watched star trek or know anything about it but heyi wont turn down a free game
i found it to be very confusing
i barely played it so i odnt know how the gameplay isbut its only for a trek fan not for an rpgaction gamer like myselfim a longtime fan of the traditional pokemon games like pokemon pearl and diamond so when i saw this spinoff i was pretty excited
unfortunately it took me a long time to actually get around to playing this game various reasons i wont go into
it seems with pokemon ranger that they were looking to emphasize the rpg gameplay a bit more than the monsterraising aspects
well i was excited to play this but unfortunately i wasnt able to finish the game
i normally do not write reviews for games i havent finished but i feel i need to write a review on this to warn people who may be unable to finish for the same reason i did
just check the gameplay section for those details  since i got roughly halfway through the game every other categorys judgment is based on that experiencegraphics score  graphics arent too bad at all
in fact they look better than the traditional pokemon games even the most recent pokemon black and white
the character models are just more detailed looking and actually have more animations
compared to games on the ds in general the graphics are pretty average looking nothing too special but also nothing badmusic score  once again average is the word of choice id use to describe this category
the music is pretty standard fare for anyone whos familiar with pokemon games
its just simple but pleasant ambient rpgesque tunes
nothing irritating but nothing that stands out too much eithercharacters score  well as is par for the course for pokemon games the characters are pretty simplistic
you have your ubiquitous professor character and several npcs
you can choose which gender you prefer to be but either way your protagonist doesnt have much personality
the rest of the characters have a bit more personality but not much compared to real rpgs
of course the pokemon series was always aimed at children and as such have pretty simple characters so i cant really mark off too many points in this categorystory score  well ive only managed to experience half of the story but ive played all the traditional pokemon games so i already know what to expect
basically its the same old formula with your protagonist a criminal organization the gorock squad whos hilariously incompetent themes of friendship with pokemon etc
the story is moved forward by going on missions
basically you are a new ranger and the ranger station just gives you missions to complete
these missions will consist of something like go into the forest and rescue a lost person
once you finish one mission the story moves forward and you get another mission
thats about it
the story is subpar compared to the average rpg but for a pokemon game its pretty averagegameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
well here it is  the category that made me stop playing the game
this pokemon game differs from the traditional ones in a major way  there are no turnbased battles
instead you can capture friend pokemon using the stylus by drawing loops around them on the touchscreen
you also dont get to keep any of the pokemon that you capture
they stay temporarily as you work on missions and leave once the mission is done
youll also need to capture certain pokemon to clear environmental obstacles like using a cyndaquil to burn a log blocking your path
as for the stylus capturing method this is really what got me
at first it wasnt bad at all
in fact i thought the new gameplay mechanic was fresh and interesting
however as soon as i got to the section with the jungle relic and the trials the difficulty spikes immensely
i really was caught off guard
you cant use any friend pokemon to help you in here leaving you with only your partner pokemon whos completely ineffectual for these difficult captures
ive tried about twenty times and i just cant do it
i even went seeking some faqs to see if there was some great technique i was missing or something but they all just said things like be fast and good luck
yeah thanks for that
i physically cannot go any faster and im afraid to just go crazy with the thing anyways lest i scratch my lovely ds screen
ive had the thing for five whole years now and there isnt a single scratch on the screen and ill be darned if i cause one now
ill be honest here maybe im just a crappy gamer and thats why i cant do it
ive primarily been a connoisseur of turnbased rpgs and pointandclick adventure games up to this point since i just dont have good reflexes
while i have a large number of games in my collection and count myself a serious gamer ive finished and reviewed over sixty games i just cant play certain types of games
normally id just chalk up this game as not being bad in and of itself but just too hard for me
no hard feelings and such
however this game is specifically aimed towards kids
i feel that the difficulty level is unfair for them regardless of whether i can finish the game or not
not to mention even if it didnt get so difficult the gameplay would soon grow pretty stale and repetitive since its a simple mechanic without much depth to itoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
i dont normally dock a game score this low when theres not much wrong with it but being unable to finish a game really detracts for me
plus i really just cant recommend this game to anyone
kids are quickly going to get frustrated with its difficulty and fans of the deep battle mechanics from the other pokemon games are not going to find much here to satisfy them
the storyline isnt going to win any awards and the gameplay even if it isnt too hard for you is just repetitive and tedious
i find myself unable to really recommend this to anyone
if you are a longtime fan of the pokemon franchise just play black and white until a new generation comes out and skip pokemon ranger altogether
if you are new to pokemon definitely dont start with this game
try one of the more traditional pokemon games youll have much more enjoyable gameplay that will give you a much deeper more cerebral experience as you plan teams and battle strategies and such
just pick up pokemon black white pearl diamond platinum heart gold or soul silver instead of this spinoff
i guarantee one of those will bring you a much more fulfilling experience than pokemon ranger wouldthis game is fun to play a little everyday and if you get stuck just you tube it and get the way through it its all on you tube helps a lot the battle are fun and controls are fluid like would definitely recommend for a fun cheap gameupdate got the part with the bird and its impossible to beat took all the fun out of the game had to restart the thing for those chapters set to ez and put the game away wasnt even fun anymore and never made it back to where i was got a new game and it took presidence but if you think you can just play this game through on normal good luck the boss bird won everytime for about four days worth of trying even with you tube walktrhoughs still lost
so beware that before you buy this game dropped star level from five to twoat the time of its release lost planet was arguably the most hyped game from capcom since dead rising blew the minds of many myself included
while it boasts a load of potential it is ruined by a horribly fiddly control systemthrown into a cliched revenge story on a desolate icecovered planet we quickly learn the importance of a well thoughtout control system
sadly this is what makes the game so painful if it wasnt for the controls this game would have a lot going for it
the main problem is that the right analog stick controls your direction but if you tap it quickly you spin quickly in that direction
so if youre facing one direction and tap down youll turn  degrees
what this means though is if youre trying to aim at something and just want to adjust your site very slightly and you just tap the right stick youre suddenly facing a completely different direction which makes for very frustrating boss fights
and the control settings arent modifiable
at least not the problematic ones anywaymost of the game involves action on foot or controlling mech warrior style machines called vital suits which are actually pretty cool
there are different types of machines to keep things interesting
your character also possesses a batman style grappling hook which is pretty cool but overall the gameplay really suffers due to the controlsthe graphics are very nice with large explorable environments with finely detailed snow and fog
the enemies vary in their quality but typically the bosses are very detailed
there are some very nice fire and lighting effects as well so overall the graphics are really very goodbut when it really comes down to it the controls ruin this game
its probably even more disappointing because you can see the games potential as well
its like when you meet a really hot girl and you start getting along with her great and then she says she has a boyfriendi played the mulitplayer download of this game and was not impressed with anything it had to offer
i then tried the full version of the game in an attempt to try to find out if it had any hidden glory
i wasted my time
this game offers nothing unique and the graphics are not worth raving about
enemies are too easy to kill and the light up weak spots are childish and lame
with so much potiential this game was a huge disappointmentthis game has a lot of promise but the controls are painfully bad
i cannot fathom how many star reviews this has received especially when many of them comment on how the controls are difficult to master can get stuck and can be very frustrating
not to mention that when the controls get stuck in turn left or turn right mode it can be nauseating to watchpersonally im simply not interested in spending hours mastering the basics of a game that should be intuitive
using the wii controller to imitate swinging a sword should be completely natural
in this game it is just the opposite
part of the problem is that they put both the camera look direction control and the sword control on the controller and they dont play nicely together
it ends up that you have to use what i think of as the flailing hamster mode to swordfight and that takes all the fun out of itthe gunplay is mediocre
ive played much better on the ps and am spoiled by the gta series to the point that i expect the aiming mechanism to be just as fluid and simplethe graphics are surprisingly dated
again theyre weak compared to the typical ps fps
i dont really care about pretty graphics but these are poor enough to deserve mentionit could be that this game really needs a standard ps or xbox type controller with lots of buttons and two joysticks
too bad
it would be a fun game
im really looking forward to the wii game where i can put down the shotguns uzis and bfgs and just hack at a few bad guys with a swordmy advice save your money and wait for something betteri havent gotten past the first level because the controls are so bizzare in this game
buy something else and dont be this cheapred steel has sluggish controls when it comes to aiming
there is not a lot to be said about this game that other reviews have not already said
graphics are of gamecube quality
sound is decent
when you use the sword it is not the most responsive
this game is a waste of moneyjust get red steel  it is better in every signal way its like night and day
i know alot of people dont want to give the second one a chance because the first one is so bad but it really is much improvedi downloaded this during the xbox live gold free games promotion
i have been a gamer for  years and am very familiar with shooters
this one stank
the controls were awkward and didnt have a wide customization option to fix it
the story was meh and the graphics are last gen stuff
theres no realism on the gunplay  no sway or realistic recoil
checkpoints were annoyingly far apart and there is no difficulty setting
i got bored after an hour and deleted it from my console
with so many other good games out there i didnt have time to waste on this one  even when it was freea little to hard in the start of any game we want to beat and advance if we try and its to hard to get past the first act we put it away probably look like a fun game but cant get past first act sorryif you like shooting for  minutes then searching for what your supposed to do for  minutes then this game is for you
some maps have objectives others dont so you end up spending most of the time just walking around trying to figure out what to do
also no way to save games except at checkpoints
first run of the game there was a programing error that would not let me advance without the ability to save the game i had to start all over againi bought this game thinking that it would be funregardless of the multiplayer which by the way is unacceptable
the truth is the coolness factor wears off extremely fast and then it just collects dust
out of all the wii games ive played this is by far the worstim going to start this review by saying that i came to the wii as a lifetime pconly gamer
i have never felt the need to buy a console until the wii and its fun controller system came out
the aspect i was most excited about was controlling first person shooters just as precisely and intuitively as the mouse and keyboard together with the added entertainment of using it for other motionactivated actions within the game rowing throwing grenades close combat etc
as a result after spending the night out in the cold to get my console and flushed with excitement at seeing all the merchandise i grabbed three games zelda a nobrainer trauma center and call of duty  of those three titles im sorry to say that cod  was the one to leave a bitter taste in my mouthas i have stated before i am a pc gamer im really into my hobby and love the satisfaction of building a pc which can manage all the latest games
i played cod  and  on the pc and greatly enjoyed both
by far the biggest problem with the wii version however especially as someone accustomed to playing on the computer are the graphical shortcomings of the title
i literally had no idea what was going on
i could barely tell which direction the enemies were coming from and the only reason why i was going in the right direction was because of the linear construction of most of the levels
added to this i had no idea how to get rid of the first german to engage me in hand to hand combat a much advertised feature which is actually just an interactive cutscene
i followed the instructions to wave my controllers around wildly and although i worked myself into a frenzy causing my dogs to panic and think something really was attacking me that inevitable german i tried throwing all my grenades into the room he hides in kept clubbing me to death
even beyond this setback i found that the controls were often quite poorly implemented
it is also disappointing yet speaks volumes that the grenade throwing function that involves you actually throwing the nunchuck without letting go by the way unless youve got a backup tv is disabled by default trying to use it usually gets you to miss your targetget cut down blow yourself up
for the record i know that the wii controller works
ive played many hours of other games already as the system conveniently informs you
this just seems like a shoddy implementation of iti can definitely tell you that there is a lot of ambition here to convey the frenzy of war with some obvious strong attempts at creating absorbing combat scenes
nevertheless it essentially boils down to being a messy soup of blurry pixels which even to my gameplayovergraphics mentality in buying the wii blocks the enjoyability of this title
to be honest it has made me think that ww isnt the bestsuited area for the wii
after all these historical titles tend to rely a great deal on cinematically portraying the visceral splendor of war rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements
my advice on the fps front wait for the wii far cry game and see how that turns out
in the meantime there are countless hours of other great titles more suited to the wii graphics waiting for your attentionbefore leaving you id just like to clarify on thing this is the perspective of someone who has very little experience with consoles
perhaps youre reaction to the game will be very different if you come to the wii straight from a gamecube instead of pchigh definition gamingoh and if youre still determined to buy it keep an eye out for my used copy of the game im going to need the money for banana blitzweve all seen world war ii games
call of duty  and  were amazing
call of duty  was more of the same and it just got worse with the wii version
heres whythe wii remote has been able to make even the most medicore game a hit
examples include dragon ball z and excite truck
however thats only because the controls were able to work right
the controls on this game are frustrating
the nunchuck controler is used as your look finder and more often then not the cursor goes way off screen
so you end up spinning everywhere
what fun is a game if it doesnt control rightthe graphics are game cube quality at best
realistically its more like n
you can see the polygons all over the screen and you dont get the feel of crispness that the  and ps offertheres no online support like the other systems
ive said enoughon the upside the game does have intense firefights
sadly the poor controls and lame graphics cause this one upside to be quite underwhelming
plus the lack of online multiplayer causes the firefights to lose their replay valueif you must play the next installment of the series
play it on one of the other systemssuggest getting this for a different platform
its annoying on the wii if you are an old time fps and third person gamer
gestures feel awkward and often times mistake the intended resultsthe graphic of wii version is the same as my xbox classical but it still looks good to me
the game play is not more interesting than the old xmen game i have on classical xboxthe most disappointing thing is the wii remote controller does not work well with action games
many times i moved the controller to one direction but my character moved to a different direction or it did not respond at all
to get accurate movements i have to use nintendo classical controller to play action games
this is where wii loses its attraction because movements on the classical controller are not as natural as the wii remotethe only positive thing about this game is it has more characters than in other xmen gamesin short its not worth buying if you already have other xmen gamesthis game is fun at first the graphics are really niceafter a while along with loads of frustrations and ridiculous missions and objectives this  game loses its luster
its really unrealistic for example doing skateboard tricks while jumping out of an airplane
also the slowmo thing is really annoying especially for people who dont like to use the dpad and prefer to use the analog
the only skate game ill possibly buy is eas skate because it focuses on the real side of skatingi never really got into skate board games but i keep trying them to see if i can find the fun that others do but i am never able to find the fun in themi dont ask much from a game but button mashing is one thing that drives me nuts
the game seems to stop for scenes all the time
what is the point in giving me control over the character to take two steps to start a movie then get control and take three steps to start a movie
that is how this game starts and many others and then that is how this game ends
the middle is pretty good but about  hours into it i could not wait for it to end and even skipping anything extra it still took another  hours to finish
it was not bad enough to just give up but darn closethis game has poor graphics
the storyline dialog and voice acting are all very lame
the music is unremarkable
the gameplay while fast paced i found mundanethis game is a hybrid of sorts between an adventure game with jrpg cliches and a fighting game such as street fighter or king of fighters
the fighting game aspect is really like a poorly made fighting game though
it features gameplay from both adventure games and fighting games but excels at neither
tales of legendia has this same problemill start out here by saying that i couldnt finish this game
its negative points just dragged it down too far for me to feel inspired to work through them
first off and i dont know why more people havent mentioned it but there is an unacceptable amount of slowdown and ridiculous loading times in this game
on the world map if you try to rotate the camera what you get is extreme lag that wouldnt be acceptable this day and age in an online game let alone a single player title
and then once you get into a battle the load times are beyond the pale of acceptability
theres no excuse for such shoddy programmingit makes suikoden v look absolutely sprightly and that is a condemnation and a halfaside from the technical problems the battle system is simply garbage
they attempt to introduce a third plane but if you want to use it you give up the ability to strike opponents while you maneuver
if they couldnt allow you to attack while maneuvering on the field of battle there really isnt any point in including the ability to move sideways in the first place
the rest is just button mashing and sparrows can do you more substantial injury than bigger monsters simply because you cant hit them or guard against them properly
its truly a ridiculous setup
and for all intents and purposes the battles are all d which doesnt jive with the rest of the game designalso infuriating are the skits
the text is presented much too small and it shouldnt be necessary at all as the japanese version of the game has these interludes fully voice acted
guess it just wasnt worth their time in the na version of the game
well you will excuse me if im not thrilled to be getting sloppy secondsthe most frustrating thing aside from me having bought this gamenever again on a tales title i promise you that is that it could have been an excellent game
i liked the characters i liked their designs the whole thing looked decent enoughbut it fell flat on its face when it came to game play
one of my more unfortunate purchases of late
i wouldnt recommend it at allthe story is enjoyable and getting to know the worlds lore is interesting but the combat is borrrrrring
all you press is x occasionally r but it is repetitive and uninspired
this is bad since the combat is what most of your time will be invested
i dont recommend the purchasewhat adults buy games like this
this is a kids game its in  dimensions like final fantasy
i dont mind some turnbased games if the strategy is cool but like some other reviewers commented this game is terrible
you just run into the enemy and hit the x or square button a couple of times then wait to get hit
is that  technology
you can have more fun playing tomb raider or a pc game
i wish they would divide up rpgs into two distinct types firstperson d worldroaming games and anime d turnbased kids gamesi have played every call of duty game out there
i played the first one for pc which was awesome
the i played call of duty  big red one which was good
then i played call of duty finest hour
then call of duty  for xbox  then came the cod  this game was a flop in my opinion
the campaign was boring and medicore
the split screen multiplayer was stupid
the only reason i would buy this game is for the graphics and xbox live
activision failed to keep the hot streak going with this franchise
i just cant wait for cod modern warfare
yeahim sure ill get lots of haters for this review but im a very experienced and objective reviewer of games especially shooters especially fps so in my opinion i know what im talking about
ive played hundreds of em
this one does not stack up and brings nothing innovative to the table
button trigger mashing when you struggle with a nazi for a gun a couple of times in the game is not a brilliant game innovation
its a tiny little gimmickpros grenade catch and return is cool although an exact grenade arc throwing system is not used
weve seen this happen in dozens of movies some minor ragdoll physics no bad glitches or something that makes you consult the internet to see what the hell you are supposed to do fairly good score allows for subtitles some decent mass firefights some wellplaced jeeptank missions to break up the regular shooter monotonycons when i started playing i thought id put in cod
looks like many of the exact same bombed out farm houses
just very derivative graphics are only mediocre despite what anyone else says
colorless and lifeless
if you think this thing has the greatest graphics ever you havent played a lot of games
it simply doesnt
this game uses the rarely known rarely used inhouse developed ngl engine
not an engine that is used in first or maybe even nd tier quality games character physics movement is a little jagged not as fluid as in other fps and other engines unreal uses the infinite health system of cod splinter cell da gow rvegas etc
get shot a million times move back no problem annoying repetitious voice acting jerries
what is this seinfeld cannot bypass cutscenes
unforgivable uses bad grenade throwing system that most nextgen games now use instead of an exact arc system ai  average to dumb some guys stand there waiting to get shot game is so colorless its hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys a lot of the time vehicle driving is not the intuitive rtrigger  forward ltrigger  reverse of all other games it uses some moronic rtrigger  forward and then makes you press a button to go backward
not intuitive no real upgrades or innovations from last title other than those previously mentioned the wwii game genre is boring overdone oversaturated and tired so much to the point that it is one of the only genres that is routinely ridiculed for example by the folks at xplay
it is done to death to capitalize and exploit the last good war the us fought in which was so long ago well over half a century it has no bearing on the current political climate and dirty oil and strategic wars that the us currently fights in nearly anyone that fought in it is dead and none of the gen xrs playing this game have any connection to it at all
the movie industry is no different churning out  wwii film after another clint eastwood even spewed out  in  year and people laud him for it
in other words im saying its an easy and convenient softball genremy guess is that when eas medal of honor airborne and more importantly ubis squadbased fps brothers in arms hells highway both using unreal are released this title will be left in the dustgive me the lastgen halohalo doom halflife any day of the week over this fps
for military shooters give me any ubisoft title graw etc over this
for historical shooters i guess this is as good as it gets for now on the  you have to go into an alternate wwiiscifi genre andor off this platform to get a good one resistance fall of man for psok most people have more then one system i have a ps which plays copies and the  hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the  version
or should i go for the free copy i can download for the pssome people might say better graphicshmmmmmmmmmm
dont care and many dontit was a mistake for activision to take the call of duty line away from its creators for the third installment
all the big hallmarks of the call of duty franchise seem to be here linear story and cut scenes
but it doesnt seem to have the care and the excitement of the first two cods
and the third installment adds nothing to the game
for all intents it is just a poorly done expansion of the second game with no real improvements of polishing
it also seems that half of the game your character is being controlled by the computer or in a state of advanced shell shock
this seems to be a very heavy handed way of insuring the player appreciates all the scripted events throughout the gameas just another fps ww shooter it might be an alright game
but since it carries the call of duty name people should and do expect it to be better than average
it is unfortunate that cod isnt
i would recommend this game as a weekend rental maybe but this title left me very disappointed
it is good to see call of duty  returned to infinity wardi am an fps fan from way back
i enjoyed cod    cod feels like a retread to me
i would buy it again and play it again but basically it is hard to become immersed in the suspense because it is so unoriginal
it is okay
just do not get your hopes upokay i played this game with my sister spiderman doesnt even shoot webs i havent gotten far in the levels but it looks like a bite off xmen legends not fun at allnot quite what i had expected
i ordered the game after reading about it on the auran website and other places thinking it would be more like trs  railroad tycoon or some other game in which you picked up cargo passengers etc and delivered thesethem to some destination elsewhere
i was surprised when i found that about all you really do is manuver your ship from one point to the other
to me the game was no fun at all and a big flop
unlike trainz and other games or sims there isnt that much scenery just the outskirts of cities as seen from dockside and baywise
this game might get raves from some and in a few years might be a lot better but for now it definately isnot for meif youve played xmen legends then you already know exactly how youll feel about this game as it is basically the same with a new coat of paint
that is if playing with all these marvel characters is exciting for you then go for itbut frankly this is basically a glorified platform or arcade game where you move around a maze and smash things and pick up coins like you were sonic the hedgehog
that can be funbut expect little more as this is clearly not nextgeneration gaming
the character upgrade system is needlessly complex and often the powers are redundant you probably dont need twelve different ways to punch something
and perhaps most glaringly irritating about this game is the absolutely horrendous voice acting and overall story
this thing is covered in cheese and not in a good way
i think the developers of this game really need to move on to a new way of looking at video gamesi bought this game expecting an arcade style marvel rampage
when i popped the disc into my xbox expecting to be awed this game fell severely short
the graphics looked like something from ps or the orginal xbox
poor graphics are usually something i can overcome if the game is fun but when i began whooping masters of evil or whatever they were called ss i became bored very very very quickly
i switched characters out freqeuntly still no woody
i tried the different powers and object lying around still no woody
finally i repackaged the game and took it back to my local gamestop to exchange it for dead rising
now ive got a hard oni wouldnt suggest this game for anyone short of being a hardcore marvel fanboy
maybe if i had picked this game up when i was  and still collecting comics it would have been more satisfying
now that im  its just a bunk cheap release
im taking the money for the next marvel game and buying a prostitutei got this game free when i bought my xbox  elite and i played it for a while the game really takes zero skill to play so its a good game to play with friends while you are drunk other than that its rather boringi didnt get into this game like others
it seems way outdated and not up to todays standards in any department
i would rather have bought something elsethe developers of cod also have done other console versions like cod finest hour on the psthis time they have a more powerful console to work with resulting in improved graphics and sound but not many other improvementslets get right to itpros good sound design authentic settings and battles cod is a strong brandcons unrealistic gameplay enemies respawn infinitely cardboard cut out level design you can see into buildings but you can not go inside enemies respawn in this unreachable buildings most of the war is happening in areas you can not reach because the levels are linear w invisible barriers all around you everything that happens is a triggered scripted event no freedom stick the linear path to advance story game plays more like being in a movie about war than an actual war you never feel in danger because you know that big war going on outside the invisible barriers is not going to touch you levels end unexpectedly w a basic fade outgot this game as part of my console purchase along with rfomhave been playing it exclusively for last few weeks after finishing cod and  on pc
only playing single player versionpro  excellent graphics and soundcon  excessive use of sixaxis gets tiresome and repetitive
example  twisting the joysticks to control mortorsheavy weapons where simple movements would be more effective particularly when fps targeting is somewhat troublesome with this controller
in the level using a heavy weapon to destroy tanksarmored cars the cursor went where it felt like and could not lead the targets for a decent kill chance
ai has continues parades of enemy floating enemy and own squad members moving into firing line and grenade toss area
the story line is inconsistent where one level you are american next polish next french reisistance
very poor compared to original versionsi recommend not buying and will unload this when i finish single playerthe game is not rfom
it has many weird graphical glitches like heat waves running over the part of someones arm
the missions rely on an endless supply of respawning enemy
there are cutscenes that are really just bs and cannot be avoided
gameplay isnt all that great
it is a touchy bit of control mechanics
ive seen better with older medal of honor titles
in fact this one reminds me of that series with some stepped up graphics and many inherent flaws in the game
however many times i feel i am playing a moh level of graphics
oh the next generation stuff i remember getting shot in a room with nobody in it
apparently the ai can see and shoot through wallspeople who point to this and say that the  is better is laughable because the porting just shows how bad a job they did
none of the problems inherent here are present with rofm
it is clean and has none of the graphical weirdness that resulted here
so people should not be pointing to ports and saying that one system is better than anotherwhat could be said for a game that is massproducedmasstargeted and hits every single console out there ps  wii ps
is it on the ds and psp also
it is reminiscent of a poor hollywood sequelthis is not really good if you check on the videos it looks nice however once you play it it becomes really boring there a couple of stages that are really nice its much better to play it with  playersthis game purports to be an action rpg but i really just found it to be a tedious button masher
this game and its sequel are usually sold for way more than they are worthim definitely not the target audience at  years old
i did like the idea of realtime combatmovement
i enjoyed zelda phantom hourglass but could not get into this one
i played about  hours of gameplayenough to go through several parts of the story and fight my a tank battle
i realize that others enjoy this game but unfortunately i could not get into iti enjoy the old dragon quest games along with the final fantasy games
if you like those then you might be interested in dragon quest monstersjokerim still looking for a good realtime combat game other than zelda
something in the form of the old secret of mana games
ive tried the newer ones  well in a nutshell is kind of boring and the visual effects are not great as in rez for dreamcast similar and much better game
the levels are kind of hard and challenger but the game is mainly boring thats it
so boring that there are not much else to be saidthe high point about this game is definitely the mesmerizing graphics and great sound it is a nice show
this game reminds me of fantavision for the ps
if you like that game a lot you will probably like this one more than i doi really like puzzle games
tetris meteos lumines polarium ive enjoyed them all
but when you get down to it this game is just boring
i really recommend that you try this one before you buy iti have played this game and never beaten it
its not hard or anything its just boring and a bit laggy
the thing that got me irritated the most is that this game is simlilar to pokemon where you level up to get stronger
im just sick of that type of gaming you find a monster you like its at the lowest level and you have to level it up again
soo time consumingi havent played through every final fantasy game as of yet so i really cant say which game is the best and worst in the series
however out of all the ff titles i have played thus far i can say that final fantasy iii is probably my least favoriteto begin with final fantasy iii takes a step back from its predecessor the infamous final fantasy ii for nes and seems more closely related to the original than anything else you will encounter enemies with similar names  light warriors are recruited to set out and save the world crystals are again in danger and need saving the main enemy is not the last boss of the game as a stronger enemy force is manipulating the scenes at some point in the game you acquire a submarine type vehicle and can explore beneath the water various types of job classes are included
to some extent this could easily be viewed as a sequel to the very first game
there are some new editions as well the character interaction and plot building is left intact that was introduced in ffii job classes can be changed throughout the game as you gain more crystals you receive more vehicle upgrades than either of the two previous games the world map is much larger with more places to visit and explore than the previous games and of course summons is introducedwhile all of this seems to be a recipe for an epic game the game suffers mostly in plot and in gameplay
the graphics for the ds were okay but not great
in fact i think i would have enjoyed the game more had they kept the original nes graphics or upgraded them to snes quality as they did for the playstation remakes some years back
the d quality doesnt always work and i think i would have preferred simpler d graphics and use the extra space and power on creating better cutscenes
i was also not impressed with constantly having to tap the expand the screen to search for hidden switches and treasure it was fun at first but quickly lost its charm
spoilersnow i played through the first final fantasy on the original nes several times and i love that story regardless of its lack of plot
i usually do prefer a plot of course but i prefer a plot that goes somewhere and means something
in final fantasy iii i enjoyed the first half of the game much more than i did the second half
once i got off the floating continent the game felt like an endless series of fetch quests and the plot just seemed to kind of stall while waiting for me to find the rest of the crystals
sure there were several fetch quests through the first half of the game as well but the plot kept moving with these quests at a decent pace
my two favorite areas were the ancient village and the gulgan cave because you learned so much without the game giving too much away
but by the time i got toward the end of the game i was ready for it to be over with
and besides didnt anybody else feel the plot revelations by the end of the game was depressing
i mean to go through all of that only to find out that main enemy will always exist and that in time the world will indeed be destroyed as its inevitable it kind of made me wonder what was the point of me going through all of this
end spoilersgameplay was another issue
the game started off mildly easy it threw its share of challenges at me nothing too great or small
then the second half of the game took place and the challenge increased and it was a learning adjustment for me but i managed
then comes the last dungeon or should i say  dungeons and to get through it and get everything you need will take a good   to  hours at the very least probably longer
no save points either
and then you fight through a round of tough boss battles only to go up against the final boss and get wiped out in a matter of a few turns only to have lost the last  hours of your time
i pride myself on my level grinding and my characters were at levels  by the end of the game but apparently that wasnt high enough as i did on the final boss and had to redo the last  or  hours of dungeon crawling
frustrated i turned on a cheat code that raised my characters to level  and although this was much more doable it was still challenging
to not have any saves between the  dungeons to require somebody to go through  hours of torture and then wipe them out so they have to do it again is unforgivable
dont get me wrong i enjoy long games of  to  hours and i usually enjoy taking the time to scope out every area get every item complete every sidequest and gain as high of levels as i can but i also want to play at my own pace
 hours without being able to save is an insane amount of time to require of anybody regardless of the platform they are playing on regardless if they have the time to play that long or not
but the ds like most handhelds are designed for consumers who need the convenience of a game system for when they travel or have little time to play so this becomes even more mindbogglingthe job class was very cumbersome since you never knew how many battles to raise its level
and since your attacks are capped at  and you dont get anymore abilities than what you start with for a particular job a lot of the later job classes tend to feel obsolete even though they are supposed to be more powerful and effective
more variety in abilities and a level chart were definately neededand finally the side quests were just plain idiotic in my opinion
to get most of these you had to use the moggle service to send mail and you needed a friend with a ds in order to accomplish some of that
does square enix which now includes eidos i guess should i call them squeido now
really think the majority of its players want to sit and email friends instead of playing this game
this feature seems to be catering to a younger audience since i cant think of very many older folks like myself wanting to send email through the ds however since the game can be so frustrating at times younger audiences may choose to ignore this game and find one that is easier to play with perhaps a better story and better game mechanicsin summary i can at least say ive completed another number to the final fantasy franchise and i may be willing to give the original nes game a turn if it ever becomes available perhaps on the wii platform or some other console
but as for the ds i dont really recommend iti absolutely loved the first part of the game no problems therehowever many later classes just make earlier classes obsolete
you have to level up everyone with the monk class to get max hp
you have to grind for hours at the best training spot and it takes ages even at mid
you lose character skills after switching classes
i also hated the fact monsters can oneshot your party at hp no matter what you do at the end of dungeons that took at least an hour to get to with no savingas it is more frustrating than satisfying i cannot fathom to play this againive heard a lot of hype concerning the real final fantasy  so i figured i was in for a treat when i got thiswell im not sure how much this changed from the original but i found this game to be generally unappealing
it was far more tedious than final fantasy  or  or any ff the graphicsart style are just too weird and unappealingas someone whos played every single final fantasy thus far i have to give this pretty poor marks
did not enjoy and could not put more than a few hours into this without giving up any hopeafter years of being told how awesome and epic the final fantasy series is i broke down and decided to start at number one and working my way through
i really dont recommend doing so to any other newcomers to the series
if an old schoolstyle mindless xp grind with a simplistic story that makes everyone poops look like a classic novel of epic proportions is your thing by all means go for it
im guessing this game took so long to come to the us because it would really only appeal to the diehard fans of the seriesthe game vacillated between being overly simple and holding your hand a bit too much and kicking your butt for taking one misstep cave in the middle of the first town in the game im looking at you
being able to save only on the world map also presents a problem late in the game when youll find yourself up against bigger challenges at the end of long grueling dungeons and if you are unlucky enough to lose have to redo the last hour of your gameplay
if it was exciting gameplay perhaps that wouldnt be so bad but repetitive mindless turnbased combat becomes increasingly monotonous as your characters settle into their chosen roles at the endgameif youve never played a final fantasy game i strongly urge you to pick up something  or later this one will likely discourage you from giving any others a chancei have always been a huge mega man fan
ive played and beaten the original mega man  and have also played and beaten mega man x
the other side games like mega man soccer the gameboy games etc i have not played but i decided to finally try mega man zx for ds thinking it would be great
let me tell you it definitely is notfirst the graphics are pretty lowsy at best
in fact these are super nintendo graphics for goodness sakes and for a ds game i expect more
i just got done playing mario  which looks to be an exact port from the n
then to play this trashy looking game is depressingsecond the game play seems promising but it isnt
all you do is run around over the same areas over and over and over and over and over doing minute mindless tasks
why the hell can they not stick with the same chemistry that has worked for  years
i bought this game expecting the classic mega man game and it is far from thatfinally the game is extremely kiddy
so kitty that i actually cant stand it
when you complete a task you get ateddy bear
wtf is that all about
what was great about the xseries was it was a little more grown upavoid this game seriously
hopefully nintendo will come out with a xcollection pack for ds so i can enjoy the classicsmaybe fun with natal but stupid with a controller pad
lame story mode with too much time spent waiting and loadingcapcom and snk have been taking each other on for years in the arcades culminating in a few fighting games featuring characters from both companies in all their fighting glory
snk vs capcom card fighters clash updates the card fighting series from snks old neo geo pocket series and what could have been a solid card fighting game gets lost in translation thanks to some unforgiveable glitches and overall sloppy programming
there are  levels to make your way through as you discover the hundreds of battle cards featuring plenty of familiar capcom and snk characters like ryu terry bogard and even dante from devil may cry
what really could have made the game something special is the fact that the combat system is simple and easy to learn which is a big plus for those unfamiliar with card games real or digital
however this is where the games good points come to an end
the battles while simple to learn and get into feature opponents that are way too easy to beat
you really will get through the single player mode in hardly any time at all
this may be a bit forgiveable if it wasnt for some unforgiveable game glitches
the game has a habit of freezing up in play and in between combat as well and you may find that the game does this quite a bit
this alone is what really kills what could have otherwise been a solid game
there are some pretty shallow multiplayer features and barely any use of the ds touch screen which only round out a disappointing package
all in all hardcore card gaming enthusiasts may want to give snk vs capcom card fighters clash a look but dont expect anything special or even remotely good from itthe game by itself is good on the action but nothing new
the same clones and more of the weird stuff
nothing new i total rip off and the ending was horrible and left you hanging just like half life a total rip off
i want my money backi looked everywhere on how to fix this game and couldnt find much help
i installed the game on my windows and did not change the compatibilty mode
what i did was i opened the file location
from there i clicked on launcher
then a tiny box pops up
for screen resolution select the correct size of your screen resolution theres three options
i had to change mine to x as that is the resolution my computer is set to
then it will play
simple
about the game i got too bored and dizzy from it to play anymore
it even seemed like more of a comedy game rather than a horror
wouldnt recommendi bought the vision camera on launch day because i thought it would be a great idea to video chat send picture messages and more with this camera
unfortunately the lowresolution and subpar framerate of this camera have left a bad taste in my mouthvideo chats are not that impressive because of the low framerate of the camera
instead of  frames per second like most digital cameras i think the vision camera has a framerate of maybe  frames per second
and thats on a good day
if you and a friend are chatting and just sitting still this will offer decent results
the second one of you start to move the video becomes choppy and grainy almost instantlyspeaking of grain the resolution of the vision camera rivals that of most entrylevel cell phones
i understand that it would be extremely cost prohibitive to include a  megapixel camera but taking a picture with this thing is just bad
unless you have professionalgrade lighting equipment in your house youre not going to get anything thats worth keeping for too longanother thing that was promised with the use of the vision camera was gesturebased and live feed based gaming
the game that comes for free with the camera totem ball has been a continual source of frustration because the camera has a hard time picking up where youre standing and where your arms are at
to move your character around and ultimately play the game you have to continually move your arms up and down
it would be one thing if this was just physically tiring but the game is really not that good and the camera has a hard time distinguishing where you are or how far away you are if youre playing on a larger tv set
and the live feed based games just show a continual video feed of your usually seminude opponents during games like uno and a few others
this doesnt offer that much to the gameplay except you now get to see whos calling you racial slurs or hurling homophobic remarksthe camera really doesnt deliver on its promises so id recommend everyone to pass on this investmentok  i love love love this book and the british movie with sean connery et al
so i think  cool  i can play a game that will have some of the same beautiful settings as the bookmovie
while this is true  the graphics are good and the overall look of the game is nice  the game play is horrible
once i figured out all the characters are exactly the same as the book and the plot is exactly the same i got a sinking feeling in my stomach about the  i had just spentgood things  there is an alternate ending that the game makers have added in to at least add a little bit of interest to the finale
 some of the puzzles take a little bit of thought to figure them out
 pretty pictures and engaging play keeps you interested
 you tell the gathered suspects how the murder happened at the end based upon your clues
be sure to review all your clues before poirot is carried into the salon car to reveal the murdererbad things  game is very linear
there is no veering from the track that is set for you
there are several places where you have to solve certain puzzles before you are allowed to go on
however it is often hard to know if you are done investigating or not
 some of the puzzles are infantile in simplicity and  of the puzzles are so hard that there is no way to solve wo downloading the cheat
im not kidding  one of the puzzles you will never get in a  years
this seriously detracts from the game play
 you play a game with poirot who is bedridden with a bruised ankle during much of the game play to see if you can figure it out with little or no help from him
this should be a positive
however in many parts of the game you dont know if you are done until you come back to talk to him and if you arent he docks you
not really fair
and at the end the game doesnt give you any kind of score or whatever to gauge how well you did
 if you know the book you know the plot who did it and how its solved
this fact makes the game play simply a job to get to the endi really wanted to like this game but its hard
 of the game play is just dull plugging and chugging and searching for clues or solving easy puzzles while the other  is impossible  not a great combo
i doubt ill by and then there were none either based upon the game play of this christie game
followup note  yes i was dumb enough to buy attwn  at least i only spent  this time
same boring gameplay though  maybe third time will be the charm
unless you have never ever read this bookseen the movie look somewhere elsemy wife and i are fans of adventure games but motoe and its previously released sibling attwn are sorry excuses for the genre
much of the game play is tedious and the puzzles are illogical although slightly less so than attwn
after giving this nd part of the adventure companys agatha christie series a chance i dont expect well be wasting money or time on any future installmentsi really wanted to like this game after all i enjoyed and then there were none despite some flaws
but this game was simply bad from the getgofor one thing there are very few puzzles most of them are ridiculously easy although one radio puzzle forced me to try random combinations until i finally worked it out
either way i didnt get a feeling of satisfaction from solving them
it also made for a very short game less than  hours for mesecondly this game is really more of an animated movie than a game
you spend most of your time tracking down your suspects and then patiently working your way through the dialogue tree until youve exhausted their information
its incredibly tedious especially because most of the dialogue is wordforword from the novel
i appreciate the respect they showed the book but seriously if the game isnt any different from the book then theres no point in playingwhich brings me to my biggest complaint with the game the original ending
and then there were none had a genuinely different ending which made sense and which you could figure out through the clues
i dont want to give away the ending to murder on the orient express but i will say that adding a single twist to the ending is an infuriatingly cheap way of creating a new ending
and if that werent irritating enough you really dont get to do anything for the last half hour of the game as poirot sums up the case and occasionally tosses you a multiplechoice question just to make sure that youre still awakehigh points david suchet as poirot most of the other voiceacting was good and the backgrounds were lovelylow points poor gameplay too short and easy ending likely to disappoint fans of the novelwell i was a huge fan of and then there were none but there were a lot of problems with this game
i was totally and completely confused throughout the middle and end of the game because characters were talking to me about items that i hadnt even found yet
i was wondering am i missing something
i have no idea what these people are talking about
and then i would search a room and find the item a little later
it is very difficult to figure out how to move forward in this game
i was stuck for a week at one point just figuring out what to do next
it doesnt lead you through the game very well as it did in the first agatha christie gameit was also very hard to keep track of the characters names at first
there  are about  characters and when they were talking about eachother i didnt know who they were talking about because i couldnt keep the names straight
for instance if i was searching col arbuthnots room i didnt even know which man he was to go back and talk to himfinally i found the end very confusing
there are a lot of things that the game still didnt explain
overall i was very disappointed with this game and i hope if they make another one it is a lot betterto start things off i was about a teenager when they announced this game was gonna be released for the sega saturn
i was a hardcore sonic fan and i was so excited when they announced itll be released during the holidays
i thought that itll be the best game everrightnot what i expectedit started on christmas day when i found a game sized gift from my parents
i figured it was sonic r because i was blabbing on about how i wanted the game
i opened up the package and found i was right
i was so excited i quickly went to try the game with my parents following me
first when i began the game i saw sonic tails and knuckles in running positions and i heard a song called can you feel the sunshine
i can say one thing that song is amazing
i quickly pressed start
now to get to the real review
to start with the positive stuff i already said i liked the music
i thought the stage sceneries were pretty to look at and i also liked that there were new characters to play with
to the negative stuff
some of the stages were scrappy and poorly designed
there were only two characters that were actually in cars eggman and amy
i think it sucked that only two characters were in vehicles
so overall the game has few positives and mostly negatives
so did i keep the game
well i wouldve gotten rid of it but there were the positive stuff which of course i didnt want to losethis game looks like it should be a pc game on the internet instead of the ps
this game is fairly fun but it gets really hard later
a cheap game in my opinionseeing as how someone has already reviewed the game pretty completely i will just add to it instead of covering everythingi have to say i am a little disappointed with this game
i love family guy and really was looking forward to a fun romp with the characters
however the game emulates the simpsons poor offerings instead of beavis and buttheads hilarious adventure game for the pcin my honest opinion the biggest problem with the game is i think its not finished
like most games from k labs the game seems glitchy and kind of raw instead of the polished products from other marquee studiosfor instance the graphics are fine but the cut scenes do not mesh at all
i understand if there is loading times however there is no flow
sometimes a cut scene will happen and it seems to have absolutely no continuity with the game at allmore so there are plenty of clipping and sight issues
the camera in brians levels is downright awful since you cant move it and stewies levels are d so your depth perception gets lost when trying tricky platform jumps
this isnt so bad except when you are jumping over fluids that kill youanother sign that the game was poorly tested is the mini games themselves
the games load out of nowhere and offer you about  seconds to read the instructions
you then have about another  seconds to figure out exactly what you are supposed to do then do it
some games are easy enough just hit the button it tells you to etc but others you will fail fast just from the lightning fast reflexes you need from figuring the game out and doing it
this isnt an issue if you die and then go back because over time you will learn itthat leads me to another issue
you will die in this game
a lot
brians levels are all trial and error just learning the board and how to manuever it
each character is on a set track and like metal gear you need to study their movements and run around them without being seen
sounds easy and it mostly is but it gets old fast
that is all he does too
each level is just another set of rooms you need to get through
some are difficult some are easy
but beyond the odd costume you get there really is no variation to his gamepeters levels play like streets of rage or final fight
a nice retro aspect but peters game gets boring quick
he basically can kick and punch
he learns a few additional moves but nothing spectacular
and there really are only  different enemies and a couple bosses they are just recycled over and over in different quantities
also there are only several rooms per level just asthetically changed
nothing special at all
my biggest gripe with peters levels are that they are just freaking hard
add in monotonous and you have a bad combination
peter is not very strong and his health is drained fairly quickly
add in the fact that even when you are attacking an enemy he can still hit you so you are going to take a lot of damage
the difficulty is compunded by the limited supply of health in some rooms and the sheer number of enemies they throw at you at once
in later levels you will fight  or more of the harder enemies at once
two of them can kill you pretty quickly so it just gets super repetative and frustrating after a while
finally each enemy has a certain way it must be killed making the game even more ridiculous
for instance a kid has to be kicked while adults have to be punched and cops need to be kicked repetatively then stomped and then swat members need to be swept
this is ok but when you are fighting one of each it means you can only damage certain enemies with punches etc  thus the game allows you to be beat on far too easilylastly is stewies levels
they are the most fun both gameplay wise and comedy wise
stewie has a couple guns and his game is a pretty standard platform game
nothing too ridiculous just the same run around shoot the bad guys collect items and open a door
his levels also are pretty much more of the same after a while
what frustrates you about his are the depth deceiving jumps you need to make
because the camera doesnt rotate you need to make double jumps blind and have to land on smaller platforms below or die
in d it is hard to determine your depth and you will die alot from missingi know i am griping a lot about petty gameplay things but honestly it ruins my fun level with the game
the first hour or so was the best for me because the game was more interactive in the beginning and the novelty factor
but about an hour into the game you have done just about everything the game is going to throw at you
thus let the repetition begin
peters levels are way too hard considering the fun ridiculous nature of the game and the general glitches and shoddy appearancelayout of the game shows it was pretty much thrown together quickly and poorly tested
i think with a couple more months in development this game could have been a bigger hit but alas it is a failure in my eyesthe story istelf is very funny
lots of recycled gags from the show and some good jokes
it is a bit tamer than the show and there isnt a whole lot of new humor here
i would give this one a miss and rent it
that way you can get rid of it when you get boredthe family guy game tries to do many different things and fails at nearly all of them
the game is laugh out loud funny but that is the only good aspect
it contains at least  different games two of which are awful
but unfortunately even for a game this short they all get boring and repetitivethe stewie part is a basic platformer where you will shoot enemies and jump around
it has brief moments of greatness for example the under utilized mind control ray
but these levels especially after he gets shrunk and voyages into a person are repetitive and blandbrians part is a stealth game and is just terrible
did you ever play games where you have to memorize the pattern of patroling units likemetal gear solid  sons of liberty
if you did you may remember it being frustrating and you probably failed many times
literally that is the entirety of brians game  a different room with different guards over and over againpeters part is a basic smashemup with a slight twist
you can kick and punch also some special moves but enemies will only be vulnerable to one of those two
after a few scenes of this it gets real old and the fact that it is hard and repetitive dont helpthere are also mini games
these are the flashback this is worse than that one time when part of the game
they play out similar to warioware games where you get a second or two to figure out what to do and then go but are not essential to the game  if you win you get a bonus collectable items temporary power and losing doesnt cause anything negative
generally these are usually funny or at least randomeven with all of the diversity in gameplay this is short and repetitive  way too repetitive for a game that takes less than  hours to complete
the saving grace of the game is the family guy style of humor
they reused a number of amusing things from the show as background
there are a lot of funny moments like jesus flipping out because he got the wrong color of mm he knows he can change the color its the principle peter dressing up as anna
 brians peanut butter jelly time costume marco polo with helen keller and the evil pointing monkey in chris room but ultimately this is a game and not an episodeas a game it fails
miserablyim sure there are worse games out there  graphic and playabilitywise but i have to agree with my headline here when i say this game sucksi traded it in after owning it for about a month
i would recommend against buying this game unless you an find it free or for under  but then the issue is that its just plain a waste of timei have to endorse what some other people have formerly stated that youre better off just picking up a whole season and watching it
id have to recommend the season  volume  box set which is my personal favoriteoverall the games pretty sucky dont buy it periodthe game is alright
obviously good enough for me to finish the whole thing
but mainly i just finished it out of shear hope that it would get betterthe thing that really confused me though was how can a game on play station  that is based on a cartoon have worse graphics than the actual cartoonand there were glitches galore which have pretty much been well covered in the spot lighted reviews but i encountered one in a level in which brian was sneaking around which encompasses all the brian levels and the way brian got through the level was by wearing a costume that would disappear but come back as soon as he hid in the shadows
after the first time i died in the level when i came back as brian the costume was gone and there was nothing i could do to get it back and i couldnt beat the level without it so i had to restart the game from the beginning so i could beat that level
luckily for me i was less than two hours into the game and the second time i got to that level the glitch was gonebut the brian sneaking levels were honestly dull grueling and pointless
if it werent for the stewie and peter levels coming up i would have never had the motivation to finish brians levels
but dont let that fool you peter and stewies levels werent all that great either
and if you are looking for fresh new family guy comedy dont
almost all the jokes were recycled from the showwhen i purchased my xbox  i searched amazon for the best review on all the games at the time
oblivion stood out as a must have game
so i had to get it
i like roleplaying games but this is the first time ive played one since the playstation  days
how this game plays out to me is nearly impossible
it would take weeks to actually understand the game and how to pull out its full potential
but lets play the game without reading the manual wont happen
it took me a couple hours to create my character
you have to think whether you should be this race or that race what class you should be how dark his skin how long his nose how thick his beard what color his hair how pointy his ears the color of his eyes the thickness of his face etc etc etc
and so you finally know what you want to be
now youre playing the game
the game has so many controls that you have to read the manual to understand exactly how your inventory works
cause the inventory is full of symbols and you need to know these symbols by heart
as you play the early game you collect rat meat and bones
ok so what is the purpose of these
will i need them
eventually you will get encumbered so because their value is worth  gold you must drop them
and so as youre gathering treasures eventually youll have to spend a lot of time going through your inventory wondering what you should drop
keeping the most valuable not necessarily the most useful cause you dont know what you need yet
and you dont know if what you drop youll need later
so you just want this game to pick up
it has great reviews people love it and supposedly had a good time with it but im stuck here wondering what these things do
very frustrating if you ask me
eventually youll be asked what kind of star sign do you want to be
and this is when i quit the game it was the very start of the game
and it gives you about a dozen constellations and a description of each
oh great so now i have to read each and every one of these signs and their uses
lets see i can become invisible for  hour a day or i can give added strength to my character
which one is better
thats the problem you dont know
you just started the game and collected small treasures
trying to understand the purpose of walking around killing things and collecting a few gold
but i spent hours reading the manual only to forget a few days later when i picked up the paddle again
so it was just very complex you need a roleplaying degree to play this game
its not like halo where you can turn the game on pick up the paddle and go on an adventure killing things
sorry for rambling on but this game isnt something you want to play if you dont have the time to play it
halo was the first game i played for  and playing it a couple hours a day was awesome
i had surround subwoofers laying on the couch at night and it was amazing
try it with oblivion and you have to turn on the light to read the manual spend the entire  hours trying to understand it
then forget how to play the next day
its just not a game for everybody i guessim a mature gameplayer who recently bought a dozen videogames and an xbox  just to see how the technology has evolved
compared to other games ive tried i found this game to be boring and in parts annoying and after a few returns have not been able to finish it
for me the core problem is the insane level of depth and arcana you are required to manage  a cluttered map a panoply of characters tribes and evil thingies a menu for all your clothes and armor another for your spells another for your weapons another for your trinket odds and ends a self designed avatar several maps powers and attributes that come and go  its like managing a special needs preschooler
and this is a game
and then theres the open ended scripting of a plot that is so complicated you need to take notes to keep track of it all
the visual design is ok but i found it insufferable to interact with the character talking heads whose mouths are really annoying to look at as they patter the lamest interactive dialog of any game i have tried
and the action elements are uncompelling and dont require much skill to accomplish
the only grace is the landscape rendering which is fun just to roam through and leads to all kinds of random sometimes bizarre encountersof course this is my review my opinion
this game pisses me off because its obviously high regarded and loved by all yet i cant find out why
gamespot gave it a  i cant seem to figure out what im missing
just sheer size mass and freedom of a game does not make it fun to play to me
you will walk around this huge world and encounter only a handful of enemies all very weak
the enemies difficulties do not seem to change depending on where you are on the map either
you can investigate caves but there are only a few weak enemies in them very little treasure and nothing exciting happens ever
the battle controls are clunky he seems to swing the sword so slow and delayed
you can heal but it doesnt seem to do anything
and gaining experience depends on using the skills that you attribute in the beginning of the game not fighting enemies like traditional rpgs
yes you can steal and virtual do anything you want but that gets old after a while
the fact that you can travel from virtually any point in the map automatically takes away from the game big time traveling is a huge part of rpgs for me
also if the action gets too tough for you just go into the menu and slide the difficulty meter to easy wtf is that
having played about  hours it just wasnt fun for me needless to say
i am not a deviant usually when games have such ridiculously positive ratings like this one i end up loving them like everyone else which is why im so vexedthe graphics are indeed very good with a realtime environmentthe sun sets and the moon comes out etc and all the npcs do their own thing
this game does not play out like a typical rpg for me it seemed more like a virtual reality game a sims gamei love the ff series exploring caves fighting monsters buying and selling weapons and armor which is all in this game although a huge problem for me is that it lacks incentiveive been playing a whole bunch of other games lately and this one took a back burner
i played it for about  hours or so and i was starting to get bored
there is a lot of detail and involvement in creating and setting up your character
in the end its an ok rpg maybe it works for some people but not for me
im also playing mass effect and bioshock right now and both are waaaay funner
i went to my local used games shop and they only offered me  bucks for my copy of elder scrolls iv
they had a lot of them on the shelfi bought this game because of its great reviews
however im surprised at the lack of fighting and basic physics of the movement
the world his hugeyeah great but the simple movement is so monotonous and slow
why cant we get the movement from zelda
i just dont see what the hype is all abouti guess im missing something here but the game was confusing as hell
ive played rpgs before but mostly ones from squaresoft which arent as customizable as this one was
in my opinion the customization is annoyingit makes the game way to complicated
ill put it this way  ive played for over  hours and i still dont know how to get my guy to gain a level
theres just way too many skills and stuff in this gamethe graphics are okay
if youre not playing on a hdtv this game will look a lot like a ps game
the gameplay is pretty tedious
combine those  features and youve got one heck of an overrated gameone last gripe  and maybe this only occurs on my system  but the graphics skip around very frequently while playing
this was by no means a smooth playing experience
it seems like they made the worlds too big for the  to handle or something because it skips around quite frequently during normal gameplayto me this is one of those games that are addictive but boring
quite ironic i knowwhat did you think i was going to rate this gamethe game play suckscheckingpassingshooting are all unrealisticthe only thing that holds the game together are graphics and the shootout which is very realistic how the goalie movesthe goalies are very realistic though with saves and ai
but once a game allow a fluke goal from the bluelinethe other good thing is the stick controlvery nicely donebut still what hurts the game is passingshootingand checkingi reviewed nhl  last year and gave it a favorable review
while i chose to purchase nhl k in its place i still thought the ea version was legitso fast forward to september 
k sports delays the release of nhl k while eas website seems to tout a bunch of new features including a very deep franchise mode which allows someone to do a bunch of new and realistic features such as claiming people off waivers twoway contracts and the like
as it turns out these features are only available for the xbox  versionplaying this game is inconsistent at best
passes are about half and half for reaching their target
to your advantage some rather odd shots go in most of the time
however your goalie will probably be scored upon if the computer takes one shot from center ice and you usually have to pelt their goalie pretty hard to win
the controls are almost exclusively done using the r and l buttons which takes a while to get the hang ofthe roster management features and franchise features are are as inconsistent as the gameplay
on one hand you can earn your way up to the top and buy upgrades based on performance something k sports is missing out on
however the functions of other features are a bit oddfor example dressing someone from the minors automatically assigns someone else to the minor team without you choosing who youre going to reassign or scratch
you can only offer up to  year deals during contract negotiations and usually overpay for whomever is signed considering todays hockey economic realitiesthe design of the game is literally just the same as it was the year before
the createaplayer options are the same as they were the year before and nothing noteworthy has changed in regards to the presentation of the gamewhile i feel the ea version has better graphics than the k version the k version has better detail for equipment especially for goaltenders
its nice to see each goalie wear namebrand equipment it just happens to be the same equipment they more  to  years ago depending on the goaliethe redeeming factor of the game was that they included the teams from the elite leagues in sweden finland germany and czech republic
you can trade players between leagues when you set the game up which is nice considering how many nhl prospects are still in europe so you can update the rosters a bit but considering that most of the best players in the system are in russia i dont think either ea or the nhl could make that possiblethe bottom line as bad as the bugs are in the game i still recommend the k sports version over the ea version based on the gameplay and franchise modes
having far more experience in releasing hockey titles plus not to mention the higher price tag i expected more out of the ea franchise
granted it wasnt a pile of garbage in comparison to some other hockey games ive played but if ea could have put some of the time into this game that they did for their game for xbox  i would have gladly paid more for the gameps
the soundtrack is too soft for hockey
ea should put more metal bands in the soundtrack than the nuemoindiegarage rock thats on herei have played nba live since day   the changes that ea has made to nba live  were such a disappointment that i am going to go and buy nbak
first they made it harder to dunk
you have to use the left analog and the triangle instead of just leaving it the same way it was last year
the freethrows are now with the analog stick which makes it a little more difficult
the graphics look like cartoon figures
they could have just tweaked last years version but they tried to do too much with the game and ended up messing up a good franchise
i think i may have purchased my last nba live unless they go back to the way that they use to be
some people like playing for fun and ea has taken out all the fun out of this poor excuse for a game
this game is so bad that the ny knicks are rated a  overall
they were one of the worst franchises last year and now they are one of the best as far as skill level
save  and buy nbakrayman raving rabbids is not really a game but more like a tech demo
sure wii already has tech demos in fact most of the launch line up except for zelda is filled with tech demos
but what makes this one different
it has retarded screaming bunnies
from this already your good instincts should tell you to stay away  you play as a limbless creature named rayman who has been kidnapped by retarded bunnies and you have to partake in something like  minigames to plunge your way to freedom
the premise is stupid just a way to tie together all the minigames
the minis themselves range from barely playable to just plain abysmal
you will not want to play most of these games because they are either stupid concepts or badly designed
very few of the games are fun but they lose their charm after playing them once or twice
many of the minigames also share the same gimmick which wouldnt be a issue if the gimmicks were less simple and easy to spot
the minigames alone makes the game horrible and not worthy of anyones moneythere are really only two upsides to owning this game
one the first person shooter boss battles
after every stage composed of  games there is a boss battle and sometimes you are treated to a very fun arcade style shootem up game
these are some of the best use of the controller on the system and are increadably fun but you will have to suffer through the rest of the crap to get to it
the other upside is humor
the bunnies are so stupid and they are so horribly exploited in some of the minigames that it becomes funny
of course you are lowered down do retarded humor but if you just need a good laugh this game will provide entertainmentotherwise this game is just a bad minigame collection that may provide some fun in the form of a boss battle or just retarded humor but usually it is just frustratingly bad not worth the time or money
save both by giving this one a pass overallits hard to review a game like this because theres so much going on
complete about half of the single player campaign and youll start to see what i mean
dancing games shooting games skill games which usually force you to have impeccable timing sports games which involve you shaking your wiimotes as fast as you can and a whole lot moreif i were judging on variety alone this is an easy star game
big big mistakes keep me from rating it highlythe first major problem with the game is that you have to unlock everything
even two player mode
and the only way to do that is to play the game in single player mode
for what is primarily a party game this is absurd especially since playing on single player gives you a chance to get a handle on the unusual timing and other aspects of each game and youll maintain a healthy advantage over your opponents
some might not find this to be too problematic but if you want to play with a group you have no option other than to spend lots of time playing on your own or repeating the same minigames over and over as a group
if you get to unlock two player mode which is very easy youll only have access to the four or five games you have played through on single player mode
its silly and annoying to have to do this and it really sucks a lot of fun out of the gamethe second problem with the game is the difficulty level of some games
dancing is really easy  everyone gets a near high score on this
then there are games like cow tossing or pig racing which you have to play dozens of times just to come close
there are a lot of wagglefest games where you and your partner just shake the wiimote as rapidly as possible often for a minute or more at a time
these are especially frustrating when you fail them on single player mode because after a single try your arm will really hurt especially the carrot juice shooting game
making this even more problematic we noticed while playing that the game is not particularly responsive to movement of the controls particularly with the nunchuk
the slow response times make some of the difficult games nearly impossiblefinally the game is party friendly but two people never get to play the same game at the same time
this is not a problem with some of the minigames but playing with four people on dance modes is very aggravating since each person must play the same song every time
other games require you to do something for a long time and with four people it can take a good ten minutes or more to complete a single round
this is an annoyance more than a legitimate complaint since this is certainly a design decision
some games simply wouldnt work on a small screen that accomodates multiple people while others would be very crowded if more were to join inparents of younger children might find some of the games a little on the vulgar or too violent side but this game is aimed more at teenagers or adults so it wont be a problem for most
if you dont want your young child exposed to pretty consistent bathroom humor however this is not a good choicethis has more shock value than anything and is funny at first
the crazy rabbits are funny to see for the first time and are laugh in a group setting
but as an adult i find the mini games to be very shallow and get old quickly
i played through the game once in singleplayer just to play through everything and had a few interesting moments on the side
but i think there are far better minigame collections out there if you want some minigames with any depth
for example how long will it be fun to slam bathroom doors on crazy rabbits that scream when the bathroom stall doors open
funny for shock value once but i look for a little more in a game than shockthis dance pad smells like pipeline gluemy dance pad came with one of the connection pins twisted i had to fix it myself because it didnt work when connected to psit works ok but the quality is very low u better buy the official one this one is not worthyi own an xbox   i was not happy with the headset that came with it so i purchased the nfl wireless headset
first of all its not wireless
the headset connects to the wireless controller by a wire that constantly gets in the way
it drains your battery pack quickly its way to tight for an adult sized head
 my headset stopped working  months after i purchased it
i am now back using the original headset you know it still works welli thought it was good product but when i got for my grandson for his xbox  he had it one day and it broke
the price for it was not high for it didi played star wars galaxies from  even though the game had little star wars in it i stayed because of the friends i made in gamei finally quit because of the following reasons and no i was never a power player never had a all powerful jedi and didnt quit because i lost my edgeone major problem in the last year of gameplay was the broken promises made by the swg team they would show hints of great things coming in their fan events and they would never come about such as guild spaceships etc what was shown at the fan event they said later was just something they were playing with and never meant as something going live so the tease at the fan event was nothing more than a tool to keep players interested and playingtrying to get world of warcraft players by copying wow and its obvious since the nge that devs who the president admitted they all played wow were there stealing ideas in some vain attempt to get wow numbers and as one article said at mmpogcom  about swgthe release of wow caused soelucasarts to radically alter the originally planned rebalance to an upgrade that not only incorporated many of blizzards features but also added a ton of bugs to boot
swg was simply not compatible with a linear style wow gameplay
those who wanted wows features were already playing wow without the bugs
if you play or played wow you can see how much they are taking from that game and trying to incorporate it into swg which isnt compatible with the swg game itself causing major bugs and tech problemslack of new content while swg devs are trying to incorporate wow gameplay into swg they have basically dropped new content they started after the nge makine quests for lower levels and working their way up so in fact if you are playing the game you are paying while they rebuild the game from the ground up to make it more like wow in essense paying to beta test i refused to do thatbugs and more bugs bugs that never was fixed from its launch or still around new bugs created as they tried to incorporat wow gameplay into a game that wasnt made for it and it seemed every patch they made to fix a bug it would make  more bugsthat are my main reasons i finally quit the game i felt i was wasting my money i got tired sitting around waiting for new content to arrive and i wasnt paying for something that isnt finished like paying for your new car while they build iti quit playing swg right before the nge was introduced mainly because i was sick of paying the money for my subscription and the game had gotten boring and i never played it anymoresince then ive heard alot of yipe about this game and decided to try the day free trial which is the same thing as if you were to buy the game with all the up to date add ons
within one day of playing i completely lost interest in it
whatever swg used to be has long since been replaced by a shell of the game that appears to have more bugs than release date
the frame rates have also taken a beating
it really seems like todays swg has been completely ruined by a slightly revamped pvp system although a buggy onei used to be an artisan in prenge
i loved it because i was able to focus  of my time on stats for master artisan and  working on marksman so i could defend myself
now the game makes you choose what you have to do the entire game
what a joke it doesnt even list riflepistolcarbine attack stats like it did for prenge so no matter how much you kill you will never gain any fighting skillsthe servers are very empty i remember when the cantinas would be over flowing with players
now there is hardly an audience
if you want a new mmorpg wait for pirates of the buring sea
that will be an awesome gamewhen i bought this game i was under the impression it consisted of a series of different puzzles
my fault for not doing enough researach
this game is a mind numbing endless game of bejeweled
at least in regular rpgs when you get to a higher level the lower level characters are easy to beat and a fight doesnt last that long
this game however takes an endless amount of time to complete a fight no matter what your level
i dont understand why there are so many high ratings on this game
if you like the idea of playing bejeweled over and over and over and over then you will like this game
there is no challenge and the story line is non existentim a casual gamer who loves games but doesnt want them to be so difficult that they cause stress
so theres nothing i hate worse than investing long hours in a game only to find that i cant beat the final boss no matter how hard i try
and this is one of those games
i agree with every positive comment that any other reviewer has made this game is great fun
but now im up against a final boss that somehow gets to take five or more turns almost every round and who blocks most magic
oh and my experience is at the  level cap so i cant do anything to improve my stats without raising tons of money
and the side quests for creating better items and spells are too frustrating to bother with
so im basically going to have to give up on the game at the very end because its a better alternative to throwing my psp against the wall in anger
i would really like to wring some game developers necks for assuming that all gamers are hardcore strategists i just want one rpg that i can beat without breaking a sweative enjoyed puzzle quest enormously more than any game in recent memory but without the satisfaction of playing it through to the end it still almost feels like a waste of timei was hoping for this mario sports title to be as good as others in the past
it isnt
its gameplay hinges on using the stylus for everything except moving
thats never goodto dribble the ball you have to continually tap the screen which gets annoying after too long
you also have to memorize which way to swipe the stylus to make any shot so if youre like me youll just memorize one shot and keep using it till it goes out of styleyou pick three of your favorite characters to be on your team and face off tourneystyle against  other groups
thats kinda nice but unlike mario tennis or the other mario sports games your computer team mates cannot interact with the ball
you have to press the l or r button to switch to different members and then control them to pick up the ball
again this gets really old really quickall in all i didnt find it much fun
maybe im in the minority but i cant really recommend this to anyonei should have learned my lesson from the family fun pack
the sims fan in me just had to have everything though for some reason i resisted the holiday packprossome nice new items
i liked the new stereo as well as some of the new decorations
some of the new clothing looks cool too
ive found more of the new items useful than those from family fun packconsprice
 for these few new items
the additions in this pack are not worth more than  maybe lesssome of the new items werent worth a dime
though some of the new clothing may look good most of it i would never select for one of my simsin summarythe term glamour life has a number of implications behind it
a new type of car would have been nice or at least more color options on the existing ones
new party items some sort of nod toward jewelry and other pricey items would have been nice as well
so much more could have been done with that theme
what this pack gives you though is a major disappointment
the price doubles the disappointment
if you can live without it wait until it hits the bargain bins
hopefully the pets expansion will make up for this disappointmentyou get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot
with all of the free stuff out there to download for the sims the stuff pack is not very worth it
maxi is just milking the franchise for every pennythe idea behind the stuff packs is great but maxis is going to have to work on the particulars for the packs to be a success
the artwork is lovely the furniture very sleek and the outfits are great
however  is too much for my budget when this stuff pack only includes  items
same as family fun im waiting until glamour drops to although the clothes for the adults are really nice i think it would have been good to add dressy clothes for elders and children too
the artwork is beautiful but it would have been a plus to have more from different eras
same as the furniture
glamour is more than just art deco
if they had included more styles in furniture and artwork i would have bought this immediatelyif maxis really wants to compete with the custom content on fan sites theyre going to have to increase the amount of stuff included in a pack or lower the price
there are many fan sites that have beautiful high quality custom content for free
maxis is going to have to set the bar a little higher to grab my attention at the price theyre askingim still not impressed even though my sims have a new couch after a reviewer thankfully clued us all in on the fact that the new chair is actually a piece of sectional sofa
so when you go looking for the couch in buy mode just look for the living room chair icon
what doesnt impress me is the price for this new stuff
it should have been a little bit cheaperin this addon you get a few pieces of furniture some lamps a couple rugs and paintings new mirrors some sculptures a new very small vase a new old stereo some new clothes mostly formal and new pjslove the new silk pjs one new womens hairdo and some wallpaperflooringetc
you also get a couple of new prefab houses in build mode forsythe place and a one bedroom loft
after playing around with the new stuff for several hours and adding the new house  loft to the neighborhoods i am glad i bought this addon but still feel its priced too high
i love the new house forsythe place but wish a garage had been included in the designmaxis mustve been in a rush to get this on the market too
the manual has an obvious error
it refers to the neighborhood pleasantview as pleasantville
goes to show there wasnt much thought put into this product before releaseit does fix old glitches which im happy about and i like the new loading screen music
and there are other subtle changes that were made to the game as well slightly altering the original once this is installed some of which i dont likeoverall i am glad i got it but wouldve been much happier spending less for iti love playing sims once in a while and the expansions are usually a lot of fun
however the glamour life stuff  other stuff add ons are just not worth the money
you basically just get a few new styles of furniture  clothes but nothing that makes gameplay any better or different
perhaps if they put these out at  or less with    times  the choices it may be a more worthwhile purchasethe main game is decent but relatively short
the big selling point for me were all the multiplayer minigames
i knew that there would be a few throw aways but with  choices there had to be something worth playing with friends
boy was i wrong all of the games are pretty bad
many are boring landing a space ship
 some are limited by graphics rock paper scissors and nearly all have a truly wretched control scheme whackamonkeyif i hadnt played wii sports and rayman first i would have regretted buying a wii based on how poorly the wiimotes function with this piece of software
there have been several times when i swore my wiimote was broken only to switch back to wii sports and see everything acting perfectly
overall this is a disappointing launch title that not only doesnt do the wiis unique control scheme justice it actually makes you think its bad which it isntspend your money on rayman its a blast
as for smbbb ill be trading my copy inlike the nintendo ds the wiis gameplay mechanic can allow for some differing kind of control options
from the targeting reticule like twilight princess to operating in trauma center the wiimote is used in a different kind of way as well in super monkey ball
however either this was rushed or bad design but this is one of those wii titles that you want to try out since it was a launch title but youre disappointed in how off it feels
which is too bad because buried under here is a solid game but this is justi dont know badstory heh heh yeah right
basically youre a monkey in a ball and have to get around mazes in the sky to get bananas before reaching the goal
like the old sonic the hedgehog or super mario games which were basically beat a bunch of levels to get to the end theres nothing ultimately that deep here
its strictly gameplaygraphics the gamecube couldve handled this game probably
a lot of wii games look like more cleaner versions of a gamecube title
but luckily smb has a warm inviting feel to its graphics which makes it kidfriendly and helps with the overall feel of the game which is basically have funsoundmusic to be honest this is a stereo game
meaning you mute the game and just turn something on in your stereo
its not that the music is bad its just the music almost seems secondary to the experience whereas in some games the music enhances itgameplay this is where it falls completely flat on its face
essentially to control your monkey you lean the wiimote forward to speed him up and tilt it side to side to turn
ever play that game labyrinth with the marble
same idea except youre the marble problem is the monkey is so hypersensitive that he either turns too fast or hes unbelievably sluggish
jumps done by the a button are hard to time since you have to hold the controller steady lest you fall off
at one point i literally couldnt get past one stage because he kept falling off
some games such as the recent tmnt have decent controls which you put up with the whole game
this on the other hand is just needlessly frustratingshould you get this
well sometimes i recommend a game despite its flaws trauma center for all its strengths is unbelievably challenging
this i wouldnt
unless youve just bought a wii and do what i do which is just rent all the games and see what ones are good
id rent twilight princess trauma center or something else over thiswhoever was in charge of making sure the controls worked and could be learned easily by nonwii players failed so miserably on this game that they should be sentenced to death
in single player they wii remote does roughly what you think it should do
its a little mushy but for the most part is acceptable
party mode on the other hand is almost unplayable because the controls are so bad
besides not informing the players of what the controls are before each mini game i have not found a game where the controls are intuitive or it is easy to control my character
i played with a bunch of my friends and after about  minutes of playing various games they all considered this game a joke because of how difficult it was to do simple tasks like move their player around on the screenoverall this game had so much potential but fell short it letting the player control the game accurately
id say dont buy this gameafter having rented this title i am very glad i didnt spend  on it
though the main game wasnt an entire failure i felt that the minigames were severely hampered by the counterintuitive controls that usually fail to achieve intentionscontrols in every st party games that ive played  excite truck zelda twilight princess and wii sports  have had controls that have been extremely intuitive precise and manageable
and to now bare witness to such an utter catastrophe with a title thats had such a successful history is an outright shame and grave disappointment
ive heard along with other rd party developers that had started developing for the wii earlier on the developers of this title didnt have the luxury of some wiimote calibration program that developers supposedly have readily available now
if this is true then i blame the failure of this game on the lack of such a resource
in fact i hope this is the source of this games failure because at least then there is hope for vast improvements in the next smb wii titleto me this first attempt at a smb wii title is more frustrating than enoyable  especially when the concept of many minigames seem like an ingenious and fun idea  if only the controls were more intuitive and accurate
i wont be purchasing this particular title but i still have high hopes for a future improved smb title for the wiiamazingly enough this game has really good controls
whilenot perfect the aiming is quite intuitive
but the overall game is ruined by the horrible graphics
i normally do not place much emphasis on graphics but for this game they are so bad that they affect the actual game
you have trouble seeing enemies at a distance because they are so blurry
when you have a bunch of enemies running at you the graphics engine slows down so much that they look like they are running in a slow choppy like motion
the sound is also awful
ubisoft should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a game that was not finished
i will certainly think twice before buying another one of their games
that said had they put a few more months into this game they could have had a really good fps
stupid decison on their partfirst of all let me say that this is an awful game
ill say that straight out
the story is boring the settings are repetitive and the controls are absolutely god awful
the reason i gave it two stars is that the premise is ok if the execution was good the controls might work
but alas the execution is not good
whenever you want to turn you have to aim the wiimote off screen it moves very slowly and youll find yourself doing this when you want to aim
worse the wiimote is too precise and thus shaky to aim well with their set up your target shifts everywhere
also the whole game is very repetitive kill bad guys run around find the secret entrance etc
even the wiis uniqueness failed to make this game a shred of fun to playif youve never played far cry before then i recommend you play it for the pc
if you have played it for the pc and were just as disgusted as me with the ports to the xbox then stay away from the wii sequel because this is worsethe first game of far cry pushed the pc graphics of its day to the limit
the shading was spectacular with lush jungle environments shading and character design
the wii game looks like turok from the n
not even game cube quality
the movies look worse then the game graphics which i didnt know could be possible and the graphics look very polygonalthe ai in this game is dumb
i dont need to sneak up on any of my enemies because all theyll do is stand there and wait for me to change my weapons and shoot them while theyre right next to methe controls are the toughest parts to define
if youve played red steel then you know how bad the controls were
this is better but only works half the time
youll still do the occasional spin and your arm will get tired from time to timethe story is clicheacuted and boring
you have no idea whats going on except its you verses the bad guy and you have this annoying girl with you all the timeupsidelots of weaponsdown sidelame storyshady controlsugly graphicsi had high hopes for this game but once played the whole thing comes crubling down
the wiicontrols are sloppy the graphics were worse than a ds and the fun level is minimal to nonesold the game  hours after i bought itafter recently buying nba k and nba live  i will do my best to compare the two gamesnba live pros ive heard alot about the terrific graphics of k but i thought nba live actually has better graphics
the new freestyle controls are an improvement over the lagging controller to game responses of  and they allow you to take over any given game
the soundtrack is also the best ive ever heard in an nba gamecons since the opponents also have freestyle controls one player from their team will usually have terrific stats as wellive had chris webber drop  points and  boards
having said that the graphics are better on this game it all depends on the camera angle
i recommend press boxnba kpros this years association is by far better than franchise mode in nba live with new  team trades and award races
this game also has much smoother gameplay than nba live
sorry not many more pros to this onecons my biggest disappointment this year is that the game is basically the same as last years game
shaq is on the cover again and the graphics are completely unchanged despite all the hype around them
the reason i bought the game in the first place was because this game claims that one of its game modes allows you to create a player and guide him through an elite nba careertrain him improve his skills and outshine your competition to land endorsement deals and your own shoe contract
its not on the game at all
i figured that might be on the new  mode but thats not on there eitheroverall i recommend that if you are a sports fan  buy madden  but if you must have a nba game this year then go with nba  it is a bit less realistic but more entertainingwhen i went to the store the first thing that caught my eye was the good looking  price tag
i then looked over and saw that nba live o was asking for 
well i considered being nonfrugile and just grabbing the nba live since i do have nba live  and it scored as one of my favorite games i have ever played
but then i thought about it and i really hadnt ever played a k nba game and that price tag did look awfully nice
so i went with k
mistake
in my oppinion definitely
as i started playing i was quickly captured by the great game modes and how each player had a live picture of him when you went for the fantasy draft
i also found all the extra modes like situation and street to be a great idea and i was excited to dive headfirst into this amazing game
but then the game actually started
after an amazingly realistic and fun pre game announcement and comparison i started with excitement
then i got the ball of the jump and found that my player was slow and unreceptive
i quickly passed the ball to the best player in the nbs lebron james of course and to my astonishment even he was sluggish and had a terrible wide open  foot jump shot
i got back on d when they grabbed the rebound and as soon as i went for the steal i got a foul
i went for another stealanother foul
everytime i went to steal the ball was an instant foul no matter how i approached it
this horrifying gameplay went on for about  minutes until i got dead tired of it and opened the cd drive and yanked it outta there and threw in nbs live   needless to say the rest of my evening was very enjoyable and nba k still sits on my shelf to collect dust
hey it makes a good paper weight at the very least
do yourself a favor and go with liveok to finish up here are my ratings on a sclae of graphicsoutstanding realistic playersstoryline since when was there a storyline in a basketball gamegameplay if i had the choice of playing that game again or getting kicked in the crotch i would actually have to think about itsounddecent sountrack and you can use custom soundtracksoveralli would not reccomend this game to anyone
go with livefirst off i would love to ask the developers why this game was delayed a month
i have been loyal to k since their first hockey offering and i waited patiently until this year
i went out and bought nhl  was promptly disappointed sold that game and waited for this
what a wastenhl k is virtually unchanged since last year barring some minor menus alterations and updated rosters
i cannot find anything that could make a month delay understandable
this game could have easily come out in june
whats worse about the delay is that the game appears to be unfinished or at least poorly testedthe gameplay of k is almost identical to k and it is the best part of the game
although on higher levels the game deteriorates into a hitting bonanza and what is up with penalties
one of the great things about k hockey was the slide bars to slowly adjust the game in all aspects but for some reason i could not get the penalties right
either i would get  penalties a game on one setting or none at all on slightly lower scales
i still am struggling to get the bars even so you get nice parityfighting still stinks
its a joke really and shouldnt even be here if that is all they can do with it
hockey players dont turn around in the middle of a fight
eas fighting system was much more interestingthe on the fly coaching is great
i loved this feature and it is still here which is a plus
however the other strategy features arent always responsive
for instance the pressure meters or the face off setups dont always resond to your input
just a frustrating thingthe biggest gripe i have with this game is just the simple menu navigation
is it entirely neccessary to have  menus to navigate but when you traverse them all you still cant find what you want
the text and color schemes wear on the eyes and become hard to read after a while
menus take a while getting used to as wellplus in franchise mode i have noticed some major annoying features
one changing your teams playing strategy requires you to adjust it during each game
i am sure there is a save function somewhere in all those menus but i havent found it
in the franchise screnes there is no way to save your strategy setups and i find myself having to do it before each game
also everytime a player is hurt or removed from your roster the computer resets your lines to the asinine defaults
i have the autofill and autocoach features off but the game is programmed to mandate that all lines must be full so if a player is removed it will reset
what an annoyance when you completely change all of your lines from on to pp and pk lines etc then have them all reset and have to set them over again
a simple save lines function would be very easy and super nicesome other glaring omissions
no salary cap
ea had the cap in play and it was nice to keep up with the nhl but here there is only the budget which can easily be manipulated
the dekes have pretty much been removed from the game making gameplay a little more bland and lastly the feature of allowing teams to offer bonus incentives to players in their contract is useless
incentives never seem to have any impact on whether a player will sign with you or notthe franchise mode in k is fairly neat with its minor league team however much of all the bells and whistles are quickly identified as cotton candy features
what does this mean
well for the most part most of the franchise feautres have no bearing on anything other than distracting you into thinking you are managing your team
but the reality is your coaching staff contract offers minor league team etc really dont do anything
you can take the worst coaches never have your players practice ignore the chemistry meters etc and the game isnt really any different
also the game rarely rewards you with much when you do participate in these things
eas franchise mode is far more in depth and complete compared to thissadly though even though i dont care for this game gameplay wise it still is better than eas
nhl  had the worst gameplay i have ever seen in a hockey game so i am stuck with k this yearnext year i hope these developers actually put some meat in this shell of a decent hockey game
sadly seeing as how this game hasnt changed at all for the past  years i doubt itbased on the gameplay alone this is probably the most fun hockey game on the market
the controls for offensive and defensive situations are great and the goaltending and fighting controls are better than its ea rival
the color is vibrant the gameplay is smooth and the soundtrack is one of the best ive ever heard for a video game i went as far as to by dozers most recent album after hearing their song on this game
however if you get into this game on a longterm basis its magic begins to end
i did a few simulations to the end of the season and if the computer had my team win the stanley cup i ended up getting a near m bonus towards purchasing players contracts for the next season
however when i decided to play the game out and win the cup myself the bonus i received was for k a far cry from what i could have earned had i let the game play for meafter you draft new players you have to go and manually change the name
otherwise bugs begin to appear
if you run simulations with an aboveaverage team expect them to post an under  recrod by the time its said and doneall and all if youre looking for a game you and your friends can play and enjoy this is it
but if youre looking for a game that you can really get into in regards to a deep franchise mode theres unfortunately no current hockey title on the market i can really recommend for youas an old fan of hockey games i was excited for this to come out
after a little while of playing and completing a plethura of games played against friends i realized this game wasnt for me and lacked the fun element
i felt like you could score at any time with a onetimermy emoticon in the subject title says it all
although this product carries your ds games nicely
they are loose and can easily fall out or in my case when you open the case they go flying out
the case closes shut very tightly sometimes a little too tight but id recommend getting the game case that holds  and has a picture of your favorite gaming character and use these game cases to hold your not so actively played games
other wise its up to you if you wanna buy this caseelder scrolls oblivion is almost a good game
almost but not quite
instead the story is kind of dull and aimless and the graphics are clunky and as a result this game comes up a bit short in my opinionprostons of content
by the time youre done completing both the main storyline and the side missions youll be up around  hours of gameplaya large world with interesting geographical elementsconspoorlydesigned menus
it really is a pain navigating between sections especially once you start to accumulate a ton of random keys and potions and stufflots of loading
pretty much every time you enter a building or jump from area to area youll be met with a load screen that might last twenty seconds or so
this can start to feel excessive after a whileawful facial animations
this game was built using a graphics engine that was outdated even in  the faces of npcs look as though they were carved out of balls of dog poop by a retarded third graderbad thirdperson mode
while firstperson games are intended to make the player feel as though theyre experiencing the point of view of the main character they tend feel less realistic to me than a thirdperson game
unfortunately the thirdperson mode in this game feels even more detached what with the manner in which the character seems to float across the ground and flail wildly and inaccurately during combatthe story is practically nonexistent
between all of the side missions and guild quests one kind of loses track of the main story which involves closing some magical gates or something
thus you dont really build up an emotional attachment to the world or any of its inhabitantsafter a while the game devolves into a repetitive pattern of getting a quest from a npc you dont care about fasttraveling to the specified location killing someone or grabbing a special item fasttraveling back and completing the quest
lather rinse repeatbottom line there are better rpgs out there ones that look beautiful and keep the player invested
a lot of people love this game
im not one of themi thought this was for the old atari system  when i got this game it did not fit in the system
very disappointed
i used to love this game when i was a kidi am a diehard sims  pc fan and also love animal crossing for the ds so i thought i would like this
unfortunately i have found it to be extremely boring and repetitive
theres no sense of working towards a worthwhile goal in the game the tasks are boring curing pets of the flu fleas worms dressing them in inane costumes
the creativity of the pc sims game is completely missing after you create your doctor and choose your pet
as another reviewer noted cooking can be amusing
its kind of like cookin mama
otherwise it became so tedious that by the second day of owning the game i stopped playing
the time passage is also problematic as you are forced to sleep when the clinic closes so theres no development of your sim or relationships
i would only recommend this game to someone who loves animals and would like to care for virtual petsunless youve played the sims before and knowlike the series then this game will probably be great to you
but to someone whos never played sims before youll find this game horrible
the graphics are horrendous and the gameplay just isnt what i expected
the packaging can be misleading cuz by reading the back of it  it seemed like a fun game to be a vet and care for the pets but i was more spending time going to the shower and restroom for my sims than doing anything else
wish i could return it cuz its a terrible gamelets get down to the bottom of this
this game is one of the worst sims games that i have played
this is also the first sims game that i have played as well
this is not at all related to the sims  pets for the pc this is a hideous hybrid that has crept out of the dungeon depths of betatesting
you start off with a squarishugly thing thats suppose to be a pet or a cat
you see whats wrong with it and fix it get money from the customer then attend to yourself
your suppose to be a vetfirst off time passes way too fast in this game
by the time youve feed yourself youll have to run to take care of the other pets or use the bathroom before its too late
doing this over and over is so boring its petty
while other sims games have an automatic feature in which when their hungry they will fix themselves something this one doesnt
your sim is so dumb that if it needs to use the bathroom itll stand there until it releases upon itself
itll also stand and starve itself and otherslack of livingseriously your sims world exist on taking money from customers running up quickly to customers in your shop and talking to them occasionally going to the park to get other customers then sitting on the computer ordering food and products for yourself
that is what your sim does
there is no romance no dating no nothing
just seeing whats wrong as this whinny squarelooking animal thing drags its lower half on the table or limps around unrealistically
gee
you dress it with some crappy clothes teach it some tricks in which its already unporportioned body stands up and dances around to a very very cheesey song
friends
what friends
you have none
your sims life is based on ordering from a computer to buy food and products
that is your only friend
a coldclunky machine
but if your really really bored you can mix these animals to produce more hybrids
thats right change the coat into twotoned colors half of the animal can be white and the other half completely blackand have an obvious change of color line down the middle of the animal
make its head bigger than its body or smaller than its neck
make it skinny make it fat
make it stringylooking
this is a creation that not even frankenstein would approve of
it just sucks that badly graphically
these animals do little to nothing except whine about their injuries
all youll ever do is try to hear its heartbeat if its not sliding around on the floor or examine its bones with the xray if its not wiggling around either
then bath it because its dirty or has fleas
or feed it medication because it has a cold
id rather play nintendogs or trauma center than this poor excuse of a gametheres no places to go other than the park located outside of your house
thats it build a swing set or two or even put in more trees and fountains but thats all your going to really do here
but you wont really be able to do that too much
cus youll be running back inside of the house to use the bathroom or eat while in the middle of a conversation or risk starvingreleasing on yourself in public
dont forget to feed em critters too or the owners will be hopping mad and spread rumors so no one can visit youthe cooking minigame why does it even exist
at first it seems fun but after awhile it gets very very annoying
more ingredients means trickery cooking times
your literally cooking from when the lights flash on the oven
so if your even a second off your food will taste bad
that means no health bonuses
this game had the potential of being something good but it gutted the basic sim game elements that makes a sims game a sims game and refused to elaborate on that
it seems rushed and it plays rushedthe logitech g is well built and a top tier pc steering wheelpedal setup that would be well suited for gamers interested in motorsports
steering wheelthe wheel is very small and for good reason
it takes up a huge section of my computer desk and if the wheel were larger it would be monstrous
the force feedback ffb is very finicky and requires constant tweaking to get it right for each type of game
this is not a setup and forget deal
there are dozens of people on the gtr and rfactor forums constantly tweaking the ffb settings trying to get it right
it just doesnt feel like the real thing even after spending hours finetuning it
i dont feel the right amount of resistance while making a turn
the steering wheel is too stiff or overdamped most of the time
trying to make a simple low speed turn required excessive effort
the stainless steel paddle shifters always got in the way and i thought they were going to slice my fingers at one point
the leather is very cheap plasticized leather like the stuff you find on gm cars
shifterthe shifter is the worst part out of the entire g kit
the shortthrow is fun for the first few seconds until you find that the lack of resistance in the gearbox and ease of accidentally shifting into the wrong gear makes it feel like a kids playschool toy
overall the shifter felt very cheesy and it was easy to miss your shifts
pedalsthe pedals are spaced way too close together to even feel remotely realistic
the clutch pedal has no resistance hydraulic and cable clutches have some resistance more so than the throttle at least the brake pedal feels too stiff all the way through and you could bottom it out
on a normal car bottoming out the brake pedal means your hydraulic system has overboiled has failed or has air in the system bad juju
the throttle does feel realistic because most modern cars have drivebywire where the throttle pedal is linked to a sensor that transmits the data to the pcm so the throttle motor moves the plate in essence the interface is the same as the g throttle
i found that my size  shoe kept touching the throttle whenever i used the brakes
there was no deadpedal location to rest my clutch footbottom linethe g would be a great tooltoy for youngsters trying to figure out cars interested in motorsports or going for their license
i found that the g just didnt feel realistic enough to me and i felt it wasnt worth the price
i spent over a week trying it out with gtr and i couldnt get my times even close to what i had with just the keyboard because i found that my times were consistently faster using the keyboard
the steering response with the ffb wheel was very vague and useless
the shifter felt like a toy and the pedals just didnt feel rightmy biggest complaint with the g is the high cost because youre essentially just buying a good wheel and set of pedals
the dfgt has both of these for  the price so logitech could have cut the cost of the g by not including an overly complex toy of a shifter
basically take the dfgt wheel mate it with the g pedals and include a simple sequential shifter and paddle shifters
the clutch can also be left out because less than  of driving games have a clutch and only a few games like viper racing seemed to have modeled the clutch accurately
gtr gtr race race  and gtr evolution include a clutch but it serves no real purposeupdatei ordered the logitech driving force gt since i read that logitech used lessons learned from the g wheel and improved on the driving force pro wheel to develop the dfgt wheel
i know the pedals arent going to be as robust as the pedals on the g but at least the dfgt is  the price of the gi would recommend that logitech sell the gdfgt wheel a sequential shifter and g pedals wo the gated shifter at a lower price
modern directshift gearboxes use paddle shifters anyhow nissan gtr audi dsg lamborghini gallardo etci purchased this because i wanted to have something that could help me write and use the keyboard successfully at night without light on and keeping others awake
i am a hunt and peck not a real typer anymore
the trade off for visibility at night and day time is a trade off
you give up your ability to see the keys in regular light by two thirds to gain sight in dark by 
granted it works well though i have not tried all features yet
its size isnt all that much bigger than some other modern keyboards i have used
i have already hit the caps lock a few times while hitting a thoughthe very least they could have done was made and outline in white paint of the letter around the clear part then you could see the letter better
for typers this should present no problem but again if real typers feel the keys why do they need it lit up anyway
i will try it for a while but may return it
right now i have to have the backlight on all the time and that is not what i wanted when i bought this
right now i have a headache from using it in regular lightthe basic functions work well
programming game keys and the audio control was a feature that i could not get to function
in addition the keyboard is much bigger than i anticipated no room for the mouseas i never could get the volumn controls or gaming keys to work i returned the uniti got this keyboard thinking it would help me with shortcut keys to my games
the problem was that it didnt work for most of my gamesalso its only  months old and the enter key had stopped working
i had to use the enter key from the number pad
it got to be a pain so nowim using one of my old keyboards againi would not recommend this keyboard to anyonei did like how it lit up but that was the only thing i liked about itlogitech g series keyboard  gif this were a standard keyboard i would rate it at about  out of  however it is not
it is marketed as a gaming keyboard and coming from logitech i expected better
in my opinion they dropped the ball on this onei was going to write this in a pro vs con format but i realized that im not so good with that so ill just speak of my experiencethe first thing i noticed about this keyboard when i got it out of the box was its size
not real thick but its got a sizable footprint
i would not have been able to use it on this desk with my old crt monitorplugging it in and installing the software was a snap
the hardest part was feeling around the back of the computer to find an empty usb port
as soon as i plugged it in bam
pretty blue glow
the problem with the pretty blue glow is the fact that it has two settings
dim and not quite as dim
seriously the light from my monitor washes out the light from the keys
the characters on the keyboard are not reflective
they are simply translucent so as to allow light to pass through
so with the backlight turned off you cant see anything unless you have a light on
which kind of defeats the purpose of a back lit keyboardanother minor issue i have is the fact that the elevation feet on the bottom are too short
even the old compaq keyboard i used to use at work had nested feet so you pick the height that was comfortableit does have a couple of usb ports along the back edge which could come in handy
there are some music player controls up top too
seems to be the best lit area of the keyboard as well
theyre where the lcd screen is on the g if anyone cares another nice feature is the windows button lockout switch
handy
could have really used that in days gone byof course the meat of the argument against is within the software
on the surface one would be amazed at the potential power of the innocuous little g keys
and i really wanted to be amazed
instead im disappointedmy first ooh
ahh
moment came when i fired up the software and it went out and discovered a game that it already had a profile for
awesome
to bad it doesnt work
doesnt matter if i use the canned profile record my own within the profile manager or create a quick macro from within the application
it either doesnt function at all or if it does it does so improperlythe game in question is the sims  so if youre a fan you can follow along
my intent was to macroize several of the boolprop codes for building
i mean you decide
would you want to typeboolprop constrainfloorelevations falseorgpretty much a no brainer
again with the wishing it would worki could go into even more boring details of my attempts but suffice it to say that i didnt just try one method and give up
im  a pretty tenacious person and i just couldnt make it workbottom line is that i bought this keyboard specifically for the ability to run macros at the touch of a key and i cant
at least not in the applications that i really want to
the macros for firefox work great but they dont really save me a lot of effortif i find a game that the macros will actually work in then i will be much kinder but because of its current limitations it will never get top marks from me but since the rating is  and i cant make a half star this is the worst part of this gameget to know the meaning of claustrophobic
this game will take you there
most of the time throughout the game there are either people or things right next to you and you can not see them all so you end up trying to go the wrong direction right into them
also once you jump up on a highlighted item which is difficult because it wont always highlight very easy it is difficult to get off
the camera view distance keeps changing when something is close behind and since as stated there are constantly things near you it is maddening on ones equilibrium
you just spend your time wishing for more areas out in the open
it seems as though the programmer just wanted to drive you crazy insted of make a fun gamei will be honest and state that this review is based upon the stranglehold demo and not the full version which i have not played
however i cant imagine the full version deviating greatly from the demo versiongraphics  cut scenes look awful with facial expressions and cg from several years ago
in game graphics slightly better but still look like polished xbox graphics not ps qualitysound  sound feels muted and muffled lacks any real standout music or voice actinggameplay  slow down time shoot things that blow up or fall slide on stairways and counters shoot anything that shoots at you
gameplay is interesting for about the first  minutes after that it just becomes villain killing ad nauseum
literally hundreds of guys to shoot each level and about four different ways to kill themthere were three of us sitting down to play this demo and it scored a resounding  for who would like to try the full version
this was coming from a group of people that had bought played and beaten classic turds like nightmare creatures deathtrap dungeon and other bad gamesdo yourself a favor and go play max payne or bloodrayne again instead of trying this one
at least try the demo firstthis game is john woo in every way style and no substance
great shooting mechanics but after the woo factor wears off in the beginning of the game it gets very very repetitive
great game for achievementtrophy farming you wont hang your self or kick your puppy after hours of playing it but you wont play it again after you get your acheivementstrophys
like a psychotic girlboyfriend get what you can out of this game and never play it againthe hype for this game along with the screen shots and the mere fact that john woo teamed up with actor chow yunfat really had me thinking there was no way this game couldnt be great
so i picked it up at the rental store and thank god i did only rent this game and waste  as opposed to from the moment you turn the game on the graphics and story line pull you right in
you watch a few movie segments go by which are awesome and then you are cast into game play
this is when the game takes a sharp turn down hillfrom the moment you start playing you are hopelessly delivered an ambiance trying to recreate something between the lines of games max payne dead to rights and the punisher
instead you end up flying around with guns blazing on what seems like unlimited ammo at your dumb enemies mindlessly killing everything in sight
i might add that there are ridiculous amounts of enemies that come at you from all over the place and yet it takes about a hundred gun shots or so to bring you down
this is on the normal difficulty i might add
then while youre trying to like this game you cant help but realize the graphics on this game could have been accomplished on a lastgen console and it probably could have been even better than thatid also like to mention that your enemies ai are probably dumber than a toaster oven
they dont take cover
they dont try and flank you or out wit you
they just all simply take bad shots at you as they stand in the middle of their little area waiting to be shotthe game controls are a bit clumsy as well making this game even harder to try and enjoy
its easy to shoot dont get me wrong but with so many enemies coming around you from all different angles out of nowhere its difficult to try and get a grasp on who and what youre shooting at
there is a cover system but no where near is there the kind of fluidity that takes place in gaining cover compared to gears of war or the late tom clancy games of rainbow six and ghost reconthere is no innovation of any kind either
bullet time is stolen from max payne and theres the kind of third person shooting game play we get thats reminiscent from second and third rate games
the stages and levels get old fast
its the same every few seconds
go into an area fight off  bad guys press the left control pad button a few times to heal yourself and move on
i lost interest after a half of days worth of game play
i think i would rather be strangled to near death than play this game
then again playing this game was kind of like that
shrugsi have been an avid fan of mortal kombat for as long as theres been a mortal kombat
each time i have waited in great anticipation for the new installment
usually i have been pleasedrarely disappointeduntil the last two installmentsalthough i enjoyed mortal kombat shaolin monks i found it to be disappointing in that although the different realms were marked their individual rooms were not therefore i spent hours looking for a particular room and could never find it
also if you have to fight three bosses in a roweach one more difficult than the firstthen at least they could give you a little more health than they do
as for secrets welli never found any
i dont guess i was a good as i thought
mk deception was another waste of timemk armageddon arrived in stores on october  and by october  i was pretty disappointed
if i am expected to plunk down  for a game i think it is a complete ripoff to then come out with a guide at  for that same game because its obviously too difficult to master on your own
thus they have taken the fun out of it
and i dont care how many other bells and whistles theyve put in the content of the game it doesnt make up for me feeling like ive been ripped off
they have taken the fighting away for all this other junk that i dont enjoy
aerial combat is fun the mario kart ripoff game is not
the konquest mode well im already stuck on it
seems i cant figure out how to navigate an icy path from one door to the other
but then again there are no clues nothing
after a while this becomes increasingly bothersome because well how do you find out anything
oh i forgot
you plunk down that  extra for the guide
no thanksthe people behind mk armageddon say this is their last visit into repetition because the next game is supposed to have all new characters and an entirely new story
hooray for that
ive played subzero scorpion kung lao and liu kang until im ready for a change
it appears to me that you can indeed create your own fighter but it also appears that you have to unlock certain items in the konquest mode in order to do thisextremely disappointingthis game was a huge letdown
all the potential this game had went completely to waste in a madden type effort to take more of your money
this is far less of a game compared to mortal kombat deception
i bought this amazed to see it in the store and went home to play it rather eager
im a big mk fan and loved the depth that mkd created with  fight systems and a whole new level of ai
however the ai here is gone and button mashing is in
the computer is able to do moves combos and air juggles that are not possible by human players
ive tried mimicking their moves and cannot duplicate it at allthe scale of difficulty increases as you go along fights
the first few fights are easy enough then they get a little harder but by the time you get to the th fighter its nearly impossible to get one hit in
the cpu has preference over you and no matter how fast you do something their move will hit you first
you have to constantly block and hope to counter a move just to get one or two hits in
using specials constantly helps winning
the cpu will block moves but almost never block specials
i have done moves and combos and had my hits completely miss the cpu even though i was right there hitting it
this game was very badly made and the fatality system is rediculous
the days of scorpions face melting and subzeros freeze fatalities are gone and replaced by generic fatalities any character can do
they are not character specific at all
you cant use their special moves or weapons to do any amazing fatality movesimply put this is a horrid remake just put out to reap cash from mk loving consumers
sure it has every character in the game thats the only reason i gave it more than  star
however the mechanics and play of the game are horrid compared to others
button mash all you want youll probably have a better chance of winning that way
online this game might be great but i havent tried it
i wouldnt have bought this game if i had known how badly it was made
i went back to play deception its much better
i miss kabals awesome combos from mk
oh and some of the special moves you love and remember are gone and replaced by something elsesin el fallido ut esta collecion de juegos unreal es la mejor hasta ahora y mas aun con todos estos  titulos en un solo dvd y claro un pekentildeo cd de la banda sonora de algunos de elloswe didnt buy this game but rented it
i suggest doing that first before buying
its very odd
the thing that bothered me the most was all of the talking that goes on
its a bit tiresome
i guess it is a good use of the wii features but i wouldnt buy itthis a great game with many great improvements but only if you get a disc that is not flawedthis is true of my disc and if you search forums on the internet you will find the same thing happening to many others
during certain and repeateble times in the game the game stops and you get disc may be dirty or damaged error
i experience this when trying to load my rd tiger challenge and during season mode
also when playing st andrews when hole  is trying to load i get a black screen and am not even able to access my dashboard or shutdown the console via the controller
my disc is completely free of scratches or anyother cosmetic damagesneither microsoft nor ea will replace the discs each laying blame with the other
many think the blame should go to ea for using discs that arent good qualityso buyer beware great game but flawed hardwarei cant speak for all the spyware stuff people are harping on here
i dont much care about their ingame ads or whatever
im more interested in the game itselfi downloaded and tried the demo for a couple of hours
what i noticed is that the game feels a lot like bf with different vehicles and weapons
one of the things that really annoyed me was the way the video would act like it had intereference when you get hit by someone
even as a foot soldier you are apparently wearing some kind of video system
well every time you get hit it goes a little haywire like gets a little scrambled
this makes fighting a lot harder since you have a very difficult time figuring out where you are being hit from when you cant see straightsome of the controls basically require you to use a keyboard and mouse
i tried to use a throttle control for the ground vehicles but you have to use a mouse with it on my setup so i was forced to use a keyboard for the throttle
the was a minor annoyance but it makes playing in a vehicle like the hover tank seem a little corny since you strafe it around like a foot soldieri found flying vehicles to simply be sitting ducks very easy to blow out of the sky
since i enjoy flying i found this to be annoying toothe graphics are sluggish compared to bf but not horrendous
the landscapes and map designs are tired feels very much like a bf rehashif you like bf youre probably better off sticking with it there is very little that gives this version of the game a new feel to it
also the sluggish and unrealistic physics model coupled with small map areas is really starting to become boring
i enjoyed bf desert combat and bf
i barely enjoyed the demo of bf for two hours
there is nothing new to see here move alongthe graphics and gameplay are just as enjoyable as battlefield  the sound effects of automatic weapons sound even better than in bf
the car also is more fun to drive than the bf version
titan mode is a lot more fun than conquest
what i miss are the fighter jets
ironically the futuristic environments seem less interesting to me than the bf maps where there are more contemporary buildings
the international flavor of bf had some value in it
 maps dont have mosques or pagodas so they all seem generic to me
all in all the game is a blastas expectedi like this game but i dont like mandatory adware
since i preordered the game bought a new video card and maintained a dsl connection needed to satisfy the games requirements i should have a say whether adware gets installed and run inside bf
the companies running these ads shouldnt feel automatically entitled to run their ads on my pc and using my dsl connection even if the ads are made part of the games license agreementi purchased this game when it first came out
the thing was incredibly popular and just meeting the bare minimum requirements my computer was able to run it after a fashion
the number of players and servers was incredible
thousands of servers with hundreds of players per server and that was just on the official ea server bank
private rental servers were not listed nor lan games
i mean wow this was a real opportunityunfortunately it took too long to load on my system to make it worth my while
well some years later and a major upgrade the thing loads quick and runs super smooth but alas there are barely fifty people playing at any one time if thathow could this be
why is this so
well unlike other games in the genre notably the delta force series by novalogic the physics for weapons performances are gameified for lack of a better term
in the delta force series the weapons are particle based and modeled on real performances
so when you fire your weapon a bullet is actually travelling in the game environment to a target
there is something akin to that in bf but not based on any real world nor contemporary technology much less improved weapons technology as one might expect from the next generation of firearms and armor
in short if you could import a weapon from another game into this one you might do wellthe other nitpick is a major design flaw
a game like counter strike focuses on a terroristcounterterrorist scenario therefore the maps are confined by design to keep the players focused on the objectives
but in bf where it would make sense to outflank an opponent there is no lateral leeway in the maps presented
you are confined to a designated area and if you deviate you will be killed
again unlike a game like joint operations where the map is essentially infinite and you can roam and fly all over away from the action as you please
for whatever reason ea games thought otherwise of their gamethe targetting for the weapons themselves is a little clumsy and the sights on the weapons though futuristic looking as are some of the weapons models and skins they do not lend themselves to seeing the battlefield so to speak
therefore when you aim that rifle or support weapon your sights block nearly everything else from view
not a good situationthe concept of a titan though enticing doesnt lend itself to the game nor do the legged armor
and the tank weapons are as weak and poorly modeled as can be conceived
again many flawsi tried to like the game
i really did but based on my other experiences with other shooters no matter how sexy the graphics because they are appealing nor the story because it is inventive and plausible the actual gameplay though fast and furious lacks in the realism department
i found myself wanting to play jedi knight or some older gamethats not to say that bf isnt fun because it is but it doesnt hold up to other offerings on the market
even a venerable game thats seen updates again like half life counter strike and novalogics series of shooters leaves bf behind and something less than to be desiredthe one thing that bf has going for it are the sexy graphics and sound effects
the atmosphere and setting are impressive for a combat shooter but a lack of pliability and flexibility on the game map and flaws in the weapon design put it under the category of almost brilliantall in all an interesting diversion but there are bettering offerings on the market
updatei have to update my review here
i uninstalled this game to free up some space and after reinstalling it i had forgotten why i disliked tinkering with it in the first place
i purchased the deluxe dvd edition of this game thinking all the kinks had been worked out in the previous versions but they hadnti have spent the last two days trying to get this thing to work again on my computer
time which i should have been dedicating to other projects
i downloaded the  patch but it wouldnt install
i dld and tried installing it a variety of times with dls from different servers all over the world
none worked
i uninstalled the game reinstalled it patched it screwed with the registry but none of it workedi finally downloaded the final  patch installed it succesfully which took several tries because the previous dls of that file were corrupt then dld the  to  incremental update but the game still wouldnt play
i had to dl yet another patch the  to  patch and then and only then would this thing fire up in multiplayer modeyou know theres a reason i dont like the battlefield series ditto with call of duty and the two other big military shooters on the market and why i stick with my nonflashy but slightly more realistic other game
bf as far as the actual gameplay goes is just okay but has some very sexy looking graphics which is what attracts people
but to force the consumer to waste his time to download and patch up a game that should have been held back before release is just asking way too muchbuy counter strike or joint operations before you try another battlefield installmentfiguring that i loved bf three years i rushed to buy bf to play it in all its glory
since that fateful day when i wasted a few days lunch money i have spent few hours playing this gameinstalling was a hassle singing in to ea was a hassle and playing was a hassle
i had to play for several hours before i could even figure out what was going on
forget about doing well that was too much work
nevertheless i stuck with it enough to be do well in matches although i was never really satisfied
the balance of the game seemed off to meeven though it is priced very low right now i still do not recommend getting this game
i dont even know if people still play it  the servers might be empty
there are sites that track how many players are playing certain online games at once
i recommend checking those to see if people are still playing this game before buying itthe graphics and showcases in need for speed carbon on the ps are just beautiful
but the gameplay assumes you are already an expert and in the challenge modes that allow you to open up new cars and tracks is difficult to impossible at best
you cannot make one single mistake eg hitting a guardrail or you will lose and have to do the event over
when you cant win even on the easiest setting theres only one place for the gamein the recycle bin shredded in pieces
im glad i only lost five bucks over this thingthere needs to be a difficulty setting from easy to medium to hard to expert or something along those lines
not only does it allow you to become familiar with the handling and the environments it adds considerably to the replay value
some games i have been playing over  years because they are still fun
need for speed carbon on the other hand barely got fifteen minutes and its gonealso there is no time trial mode in this game where there are no cops and no other players just you trying to beat your best times
had the game had that crucial feature i would have still been playing it the gameplay of which serves as practice for mastering techniques that allow you to beat the computer cars which seem to have their own special magical physics that allows them to beat you the latter of which leads to clumsy and erratic crosses of the finish line while the computer cars just glide magically along with their own special characteristics
i watched the computer cars as i was behind them and they were taking turns that were physically impossible at certain speeds yet i the clumsy player who have been playing driving games since the s stumbled and bumbled into every possible blocking object along the way because its impossible to keep up with the computer carsno just nolike i said at the beginning though the environments are just beautiful gorgeous to look at but thats itwere these morons tripping on acid when they made this gamethis game is piss pore
and ill give you a hole list of reasons not to buy this gamethese are true factsfirst offanyone with a brain stem knows that the game was rushed so midway can plop out another game for xbox before switching consoles so that way they can screw you over just little bit furthersecond the story itself didnt make any sense at allit has nothing to do with its previous games although you see every character in itand that brings me to my third fact
every character well at least thats what they tell you
not like kia jakaata tremmor talsa and all the elemental gods
for those of you who dont know those were characters in other mk games that turned out to be another flopand you see fighters doing all these cool moves in the opening trailer like shang tsungs morphing moves that we all loved is not in it
so its save to say that this game was sold to you under false advertisement
in other words youve been hadforth half of the arenas are strait from mk deception
which goes to show you just how lazy these bastards really are
and did you notice that half of mkd arenas was off of mkda
fifth the krypt is a joke  of it filled with those crappy sketches that looks like a forth grader drew and photos of the retards that made this idiotic game
thats like showing you the leftover crap that they didnt put in your a hot dog while your eating itand if thats not bad enough in the krypt you get to unlock all the costumes that youve already seen before in their previous games
well whoopdeedosixth konquest is nothing like deception you cant freelance your way around a map like you used to or time meditate or anything cool like thatinstead they give you  lame powers and they are time freeze that only last  sec
fire ball yeah real original
telaport and earth quake punch thats it
you can finish this side game in about  hours maybe lessnot only that but youd think that konquest will explain it all on how everyone survived in the previous games but it doesntseven oh and you can forget about those bios too theyre not in in the game anymore
no if you want those you have to go online and download it
wtf
and when you do they still dont make any senseyou can easily tell that the writers were making this s up as they goeight kreate a fatality was a good idea but they should have given you the option to choose between that or new signature fatalitiesnine if there going to have weapons in the arenas they should do away with character weapons
what good would it do if shao khan has a war hammer and then theres another one in the same arenaand last is that ripoff mario cart called moron kombat i mean motor kombatwho drunk the bong water when they came up with thisi cant think of anything more dumber then to merge one of the most greatest goriest games of all time to a preschool game thats just as entertaining as watching the attention spanned of george bush
you know that little thing on the conner of the game cartridge
it says rated m for maturethats like merging mtv to sesame street hey lets watch snoop dog teach big bird on how to do crack
it just doesnt workthe only thing i liked about the game was and this was the only thing
the idea of kreate a karacter they should hold on to that one and improve it like making all kinds of players and have them installed into the profile memory and get to fight your own creations up the latter
but no they managed to screw that up too
like only giving you swords or axes
wow a lot to choose from thereand mk is just not the same without test your mightsightbottom line at least rent the game before you do something that your going to regretcould have been good but it crashes too often
also too many places where the game takes over the characters movement
too many places where you should be able to go but cant
too many silly characters who take too many shots before they fall
fine if they had amour but right in the head
too many times your feet are glued and you have to dodge bullets
too many places where the cut scene can not be bypassed
as i type my playstation is frozen solid because of this game
yes i have the update
there are other problems but i can not remember them right nowdumb story
terrible gameplay
awful controls
good graphics
tries way too hard to rip off the dead to rights series
john woo needs to stick to what he does best hard boiled action flicks
leave video games to the professionals
stranglehold would have made a better movie
i would not touch this game again with a ten foot pole
everytime i see this game for such a cheap price in stores i want to reach for it but turn and walk away because i remember how bad it is
what a shame a nextgen game turned out to be such a waste
i remember seeing screen shots for it a long time ago and thought it looked game
surprise
it looks better on paper and plays just as good toothere are few other games that have the ability to make me as angry as this game
the graphics are fairly decent but very jumpy
the fps really suck when you are doing the canyon races especially the drifts almost to the point of making them impossible to complete perfectly
the game play is somewhat reminiscent of mw and nfs underground  but never quite meets their standards of greatness
the in game physics are again a problem as ea has completely ignored the complaints of so many fans and continued to make the cops more powerful than sherman tanks while maintaining the lightning fast speed of an f race car
also the cops abilities to spawn anywhere they please is a little hokey
in addition the invisible walls still continue to be a hassle like in mw
lastly ea has this problem of making racing games with auto catchup on computer cars
add this to the fact that it is almost impossible to open new faster cars in this game and you have the impossible to win races of carbon
and i breezed through mw pursuit  and underground   the fact is this game wouldnt be worth the plastic and foil it was burned into if it didnt have a pretty extensive and fun set of non career accomplishments that allowed you to open new parts and cars without having you territory attacked every  seconds
ive played the game for maybe    hours and probably wont ever play it again
as a matter of fact im restarting my career on mw just so i can forget carbon for this game is waaaaaaaaaaayyy too much
the game play is redundant this game is shortit only took me a measly  hours to finish on the hardest setting and the replay value is very lowbasically yes this is like max payne in a small way
you can slow down time and get the advantage on your enemies
the similarities end theregame play is nice and fast paced
i had a lot of video display crashes have read others have had same problems
i suspect nvidia will release better drivers and the crashes will go away unless it is the game itselfyour weapons like the game play are always the same
dual pistols dual submachine gun m shotgun a heavy machine gunno ammo to be found so when it runs out too bad and toward the very endgrenades and rocket launcherthe lack of new goals and weapons gets old and by the start of the rd level you are worn out and somewhat bored
best to walk away for a day or so and start each level fresh to prevent it going stale
every level plays the same shoot everything survive and get to the next checkpoint
kind of like serious sam
nope you cannot save when you want either
checkpoints babyon the cool side this game gives you an environment that is about  destructible
tiles fly apart columns come crashing down lights fall and crush your enemies
you score points and survive better if you run and jump and hop across everything while gunning down baddies
think jackie chan meets tony hawkon the easy setting this game is way too easy
medium was a pretty good fight but the hardest setting was the most fun for mehonestly i expected more and was disappointed
i really really suggest you either pass this up or wait till the price drops below 
seriously
consider the fact that bioshock is available medal of honor  airborne is available not great but not bad  and you have crisys fear
expansion pack and half life s expansion pack coming all before xmas
i think the people behind stranglehold worked hard and gave it their best but spent way too much time with too narrow a focus and forgot about making the levels different and refreshing
the graphics and video experience as a whole is lovely
there just isnt anything to make me want to play it again and i almost didnt finish the game because i was so sick of doing the same thing over and over and overi say this is  if you can truly afford to blow  on this and not feel bad when the disappointment comes then go for it
if you need to be careful how you spend your money pass this up or borrow it from your stupid rich friend
no serial code or online validation baloney
just install and playthe title says it all crappy  dimensional gameplay lack of purpose too much repetition makes for a crappy gamewe gave it away after  weekssonic the hedgehog was a revolutionary game for the sega genesis that gave a new feeling to speed in a sidescroller
fifteen years since its release it is now on the game boy advance
despite the fact that the gba actually has better technical capabilities than the old sega genesis this port is anything but qualitythe good news is that the game is faithfully translated
the levels are all intact with the original animations and music
theres also an option to include the spin dash a move introduced later in the sonic series that can be turned on to improve the level of gameplay
the bad news is that the game is a chore to get through thanks to a terrible frame rate
the animations are jerky as though the game were repeatedly paused and unpaused during play
this will make gameplay difficult and also renders the controls occasionally unresponsive
half of the time youll be waiting for the game to catch up to you only to realize that some enemy has just hit you thanks to your inability to react to the jerky movements on screen
the other half of the time youll have reacted accordingly only to find that the controls didnt respond correctly leading sonic to his doomoverall sonic the hedgehog is still a good game
if you are patient you can enjoy this port
however the shoddy frame rate and unresponsive controls leave it wanting
there are several other ports on other systems that are much better quality than this one
unless you have the undying urge to play this game specifically on the game boy advance i would recommend giving it a pass and looking for a better quality translationmy son loves the sonic game controller that we plug into the tv so i got him this to play on his ds
i loved sonic as a child but when i tried to play the game it wasnt responding to my commands and frooze alot which made me die all the time
its annoying and almost unplayablethe original classic sonic the hedgehog from segas genesis ported to the gba seems like something that is impossible to be screwed up
after all with everything else to grace the gba the past few years how could anyone possibly screw up porting the bit classic to the gba
well guess what
someone did
the first thing youll notice is that the game looks like the classic speed fest you remember then youll notice the sudden slowdown and lag time that plagues the game from the moment you pop it in
now i know there was some brief moments of lag time in the original game but never anything like this
not only does this nearly ruin what could have been a perfect port of a classic game we all know and love its pretty much a reason to leave sonic genesis on the shelf
you can do the sonic spin dash now you couldnt do it until sonic  and the game includes a battery backed save feature but the lag time kills what could have been a great little game on the gba
all in all chances are youve played the original sonic on the genesis or on one of segas many compilation games on various consoles but for those who never took a dive into one of the most influential and original video game series ever avoid this gba port and check out one of segas collections on the consolessonics final gameboy appearence is sonic genesis  editioni was highly dissapointedall the game is sonic genesis on gameboythe only difference is that you can use the spin dashif they were smart they would have added the homing attack as welland put in the current main characterstailsknucklesamycreamshadowrougesilverblazemetal sonicand the chaotixas secret charactersall with the same attacks thougheggman whould have stayed the villianif youre looking for a review for lotro you might as well just pop over to world of warcraft and see what people have to say about that game
this is just wow with a few skin changes and some names taken out of a couple of tolkein booksto be fair they did expand it a bit
now as you grind pointlessly through kill and gather quests that have absolutely nothing to do with the story you can earn deeds and titles to show off or improve your characters abilities
but otherwise everything about this game feels exactly like wow from the character control right on up to the gameplay itselfif you like wow and you just want a change of scenery and a new story go ahead and give it a shot
if you didnt like wow you might want to hold off and see how it holds together at higher levels
wow wore out its welcome for me when my grind got me into desolace at about level  whether this game will sputter and fall falt on its face as well remains to be seenone final point you might want to hold off briefly either way
while the whole thing is clearly nothing more than a direct copy of world of warcraft its not nearly as polished yet
some things dont work right and its easy to get yanked out of the games environment when you go to open a door or access something and get a generic general error
messagecaveat emptorthis game was hyped up and it promised to be as good as the original unreal tournament and even have a good singleplayer but it seems that epic was more focused on the technology not even the artdirection just the technology and as a result we got a cluttery incomplete game that looks like it ripped its art from mortal kombat and was built using recycled resources from gears
the overall feel of the game actually isnt too bad in some areas it even feels better than the almost decade old classic it was supposed to surpass the weapons have that satisfying feel and are well balanced well except for the overpowered enforcer you start with and the game is fun for a little bit but youll quickly start to notice things lacking
there are hardly any maps for ctf and warfare gametypes and the rest of the gametypes are basically just different types of deathmatch
to add even more to the list of problems ut weapons do not aim perfectly at the crosshair and there is no center weapon option which means unless you hide your weapon your stuck compensating your shots left or right
there are also more annoyances as well like double tap dodging cant be disabled unless you tweak a file double jumping weve been complaining since kchampionship makes a return in contrast to the original and k there is almost no online traffic the players weigh like a gazillion pounds and cant jump high lack of jump dodge and various other things
overall this game was a total letdown and your better off finding a copy of the original ut downloading nexuiz or heck even a copy of ut kunreal tournament  is epics latest edition to the unreal tournament series and as far as i can tell its the last
epic stated a while back that they would wait a while before making another ut game a while meaning  years
unreal tournament  is a game thats so mediocre its shocking especially with all the hype that epic created over the singleplayer campaignfirst off ut is a game that looks great
the problem is it doesnt do much else
graphically its nice but the majority of the maps are saturated with brown and gray colors
it just gets really old when practically every map looks the same in terms of colors
likewise the character models look good but are also blandly colored
ut is very similar to gears of war in terms of graphics which doesnt exactly appeal to meuts sounds are generally pretty good
weapons sounds in particular were well done
music is also satisfactory the problem is that thanks to the music system epic implemented youll rarely ever hear a full track
half the time music isnt even playing in the background and theres no way to change thatgameplaywise ut feels fairly clunky at times but its still much closer to the original unreal tournament
dodgejumping was mercifully removed as were the adrenaline combos
doublejumping however is still there
its irritating how there are surfaces in some maps where one jump should be able to get you over but it actually takes two due to bad use of blocking volumes
the weapons are actually balanced pretty well which is a surprise given the general lack of everything else in this game
the deathmatch gametype in ut is excellent it may be just like every other deathmatch gametype before it but the weapons are balanced enough that its a lot of funthe ai is horrible and when i say horrible i mean complete crap
the ai is extremely unintelligent even though epics cliffyb and mark rein promised otherwise
bots struggle to move around certain areas and there are times where theyll just get stuck and move back and forth randomly
as a result a lot of the fun that could be had in warfare and ctf is gone
warfare was the most overhyped element of ut aside from the singleplayer campaign
its pretty much like an offshoot of uts onslaught except theres an orb involved
the orb lets you instantly capture nodes and prevent other nodes from being damaged
yeah really revolutionary concept there cliffythe singleplayer is easily the most overhyped element of ut and its by far the worst
we were told that it was going to be an epic campaign more like unreal or unreal  epic decided to focus on gears of war  instead of ut and it shows
the campaign is just a bunch of maps stitched together as a socalled campaign
its not even an actual campaign
luckily it has coop although it doesnt help that much
the story is so ridiculous that a  year old could have written something better
unreal tournament  is a misnomer because theres absolutely no tournament involved
its just some lame gears of waresque warthe multiplayer community is essentially dead
it was died a long time ago though
ut launch was just so horrid that it never managed to recover you couldnt even save your settings at first
 and the gimmick titan pack only extended its life for a little while
installing custom content is a pain
uninstalling it is even worse
as a result i dont have very many maps or mods installed because i know its going to be painful if i try to uninstall themas a game as overhyped as it was ut is a consolized mess and its mediocrity incarnate
if you want to get ut get it if and only if its really cheap
otherwise youre just wasting your money
ut was the last nail in the coffin for the oncegreat unreal tournament
this mess of a game just proves how little epic cares about the series that made it what it is todaythis game fails in a different way from most games that youd see as a low overall rating
most  star games would be really cheap and glitchy and frustrating
bomberman isnt any of those things
the problem is simply that its missing featuresthe game actually plays pretty much the same as a typical bomberman game
the d mode is absolutely horrible and makes the game more difficult than it needs to be however theres no reason you ever need to use d mode
if you play d classic view the rules are the same as they always were
you place bombs in a grid and try to defeat opponents
you can collect powerups that significantly enhance your abilitiesit doesnt have local multiplayer though which takes away its ability to be a party game
lacking that you need to seek out online play but finding a game online will be almost impossibleinterestingly the single player is a bit better than traditional bomberman games but not by much and bomberman was never played for its single player
single player is a survival test through a hundred levels and its very possible and not that frustrating to master
once you learn the powerups and strategies to kill the other bombermen you might even have a good time for a couple hours
key word here is might
probably notin the end despite my trying to be positive and objective theres little reason to buy this
its mediocre at best and most people will find it offensively lacking
its not even good for achievement nuts since all of those are impossible to get without many months of dedicationfirst of all i must say that when i was a kid i had always wanted a sega game gear
they kicked the gameboys butt
color screen and an eight bit processor that was every bit as good as the internal processors for the sega master system actually almost identical in fact you can actually get an adapter to play master system games on a game gear and the adapter dosent even take extra power at all nor have any processors inside of it it just directly adapts a master system cartridge to fit a game gear thats it and to be fully honest when you play some games that were made for the nes and the game gear both most of the games look better on game gear just to be totally honest
ive had both systems more on that later
one flaw in the system is the battery life
not good
it takes  aa batteries and this sucker will drain them in  hours in my experienceone day i was at a yard sale and low and behold i found a game gear
for 
no crap
the sound didnt work but it did work out of the headphones
everything else was perfect
i played on this game gear for quite a while until the headphones stopped working as well
i looked it up online and discovered this is an extremely common issue with game gears
it turns out that when the game gear came out in  there were a bunch of bad capacitors on the market at that time
most of the game gears got these bad capacitors not all of them but most of them
i must say that i do have a very extensive background in electronics i majored in computer hardware design and repair in college
so i immediately replaced all of the capacitors on the soundboard of the game gear
the speakers started working immediately and the headphones started working great as well
in fact when i got done with the system it was very loud out of the speaker
i bought probably  games for the game gear and loved  of them then i started notticing that the screen was getting almost impossible to see
you had to hold the thing at a very odd angle in order to see anything and the contrast had to be all the way up
i looked this problem up as well and guess what
when you replace the capacitors for the screen you really must replace all of the capacitors in the entire game gear in order to get it to work properly
i did this
for the longest time i would even take my game gear to pawn shops just to show it off time after time i was told this is the best screen i have ever seen on a game gear and ive never seen one of these work so well 
i would ask how much they would give me for it and i heard anywhere from  dollars
i loved the game gear for another year if that or  months when the screen went out again
it was perfect after i replaced the capacitors even better than the nintendo ds screens in terms of clarity and brightness in my opinion now the thing wasnt working
so i opened the thing up one more time to see that the screen was leaking fluid
guess what this is common as well
just replace the screen for  dollars for a good one
i gave up on itso basically i do love the system but do research on it
not all of them have these problems but most do
if you have or buy a game gear that has the sound going out of it all of these other things will happen as well its just a matter of time
it may last a few years or maybe just one year like mine did but as i said earlier do your researchgreat games include sonic the hedgehogsonic the hedgehog sonic tripple troublesonic chaosstreets of ragestreets of rage outrun not europagt racerformula mortal kombat nba jamarch rivalspaperboysonic driftsonic drift jeopardywheel of fortunefred couples golfjoe montana footballmany many more
terrible games in my opinionmonster truck warsoutrun europamortal kombatbasically every other racing gamebasically every other golf gamethat stupid tails gamethe terminator game  cant think of the exact name lol nor care tocrash test dummiesall loony toons gamesaladdinprobably more that i havent playedthe sega game gear was a brilliant idea ahead of its time but perhaps that is why it never took off
the colored screen was magnificent
as the previous comment said game boy was hard to over take
yes game boy was in black and white but it had all of the other things going its way
for example game gear is more expensive the games are more expensive its bigger and the worst thing about a game gear is that its not  much of a portable gaming system because it ran on  aas i believeand it died in about  minutes of play
the screen being lit was nice for night rides but only lasting  mins or so was not acceptable
a good system if you plan on sitting next to an outlet and playing but if you want to travel with it id pass on the game gear unless you like paying more than the price of the game gear on batteries every couple monthsi purchased this game used to added to my steam account but what i found out after typing the key is that it has been used omg
the original owner didnt reset the key on steam another useless gamethis game is not for anyone over the age of   it is not challening and has little entertainment value
if you have a little one who really loves the cars movie this may be something they enjoy but for anyone older no waythe characters from the movie are really adorable and they did make this game go along with the movie however racing gets old quickly
the mini games are ok tipping tractors is really cute and a little child might get a good laugh out of itdont waste your money on this one unless you have a young cars fan in your housethis is a great game
it has cartoony graphics a wii staple and the controls are intuitive
my problem is that the characters come unnecessarily close to saying swear words in the game
holy shoot
and kiss my axle
arent really something i want my kids running around sayingcivil war  a nation divided by the history channel lets you play as the north or the south
this first person shooter tries to immerse you in the gritty brotheronbrother fightingfor people used to the fast paced guns and assaults of the various world war ii games civil war can be a lesson in patience
when you take a shot with certain weapons theres a long reloading sequence before you can take a second shot
for those who complain this is too long its actually a shortened version from how reloading worked back then
there are cannons to fire covered wagons to hide behind and explosives to setcivil war is an odd mix when it comes to graphics
on one hand the fire graphics are pretty realistic and the rippling streams beneath the bridges add a nice ambiance
on the other hand there are clipping errors all over the place with bodies mixing into each other and into nearby scenerythe missions are standard wargame fare  kill off certain soldiers blow up certain obstacles get to certain destinations
the game however makes this challenging in ways which are not historically accurate
somehow people are able to shoot you from completely blocked vantage points
on the other hand if you crouch behind a barricade half the time they can still shoot you because you absently seem to leave body parts like your head poking up over the topai can be really awful
weve thrown a grenade at an enemy and he has completely ignored it even though it literally bounced off of him  he just kept reloading his rifle until the grenade explodedbuildings are indestructable  even with cannons  and are not properly proportioned
when you walk over to them theyre sized like hobbit houses
odd the sound is nice on the menus but ingame its just a lot of screaming and repetitive gunshots
it would have been nice to have some period music playing in the backgroundrepetitive is really a common theme in this game
the maps are very linear
the comments made by friend and foe are repetitive
the animations are so simple and overused that you get the sense that youre fighting an army of clonestheres no multiplayer at all and even many months after the game was released the downloadable content menu area does not provide access to anythingif theyd spent a few more months on this game it might have really been a lot of fun
however the way it is now you get the sense that youre playing a beta releasethis is one of the worst shooters i have played in a long time
it is not up to  graphics more like ps
i was looking foward to this game and it was a flop
reload time is annoying
lack of help from your ai team
everyone in an enemy uniform is shooting at you and only you
rent this one do not buy itever wondered why little girls dont play videogamestake a look at barbie or bratz for that matter and you know why
low production value and unimaginative gameplay
too bad this one could have been funmy wife bought this game for our son on christmas and weve been playing it because we like medal of honor and call of dutystyle firstperson shooters which this game appeared to bei think i can sum up my opinion of this game as such its a civil war version of medal of honor but is about only a third as long a third as challenging and a third as detailed
this game felt like it was basically rushed into production long before they could do justice to it and make it a truly challenging engrossing and expansive game like the civil war theme deservespluses the period weapons were very neat
um  i guess thats about itminuses the gameplay stinks
you basically just move down a prescribed path no freeroaming or wandering or approaching from different angles like in operation flashpoint where enemies just come at you fire at you and stupidly try to reload their guns in plain sight of you so you can just gun them down
youre mostly on your own and even the guys on your side mostly just do their own thing and ignore you  so its not like you are part of a squad trying to do something or a leader of a detachment tasked with a mission
you just wander around completing missions like blowing up a cannon then stealing a document then delivering it to your commander etc
there is no feeling of being in the middle of the line as the enemy charges your position or conversely charging the enemy as part of a huge division while the enemy is encamped behind a wall on a hill which is what most actual civil war combat was all about
if you were a cavalryman where most of the time you were out as part of a small detachment doing raids reconaissance and other unconventional tasks then it would make sense but the game depicts you as a regular foot soldieralso most of the weapons of this period were singleshot musketrifles
repeaters like the henry spencer and such were in extremely short supply but this game makes it seem like they were the rule rather than the exceptionstill some of the gameplay was pretty fun such as gettysburg and chattanooga because those battles were depicted fairly well but most of the other battles were pretty worthless imoim a big civil war buff and love learning and teaching about the conflict
for years ive longed for a game that brings the battles and traumas of life during the war to life
when i found out by a television commercial that the history channel helped to created civil war a nation divided i didnt not hesistate or wait to purchase one
after playing it for a few days i wished i had waited or at least read the reviews of the game
overall it was disappointingthe game allows you to play both as a reb and a yank each in about six to seven battles
you are a first person shooter and are given little tasks to complete as you move through the battle
the tasks are not at all challenging and its quite easy to complete them or find out what you have to do
all the time the opposing army is taking shots at you
i found each level would take me about  minutes to get through and most of them it only took one time
i played at the normal level but could increase it to hardthe graphics were okay and the different battles scenes seemed unique to the area in which i was fighting
often you have cannon burst or bullets fliyng over you while the sound of the battle is all around
however the ease with which you can make it through the game is not at all challenging
plus you are basically stuck on a certain course when you get started and are not allowed to roam around the land very muchi know there are a ton of really good wwii games that allow you a sense of freedom and challenge
i would rather have less than a history lesson and more action
while the intention for this game was good the result was slipshod at bestsimply put it aint worth the i like history games
i like action games
i dont like action games made with a bare bones programming
the game is not entertaining
you spend the majority of the game shooting than hiding
after each shot you get a smoke cloud that blocks your view and most of the enemies take a couple of shots to kill
yet your enemy even on easy have amazing accuracy with thier shooting
the civil war guns are known for being highly inaccurate
overall if you got to try it just rent itlike many others i couldnt wait to play this game
after playing it i was kind of dissapointed
for one the types of weapons used in the game were not that common during the war its self
secondly the solo man on a simple mission give me a break
thirdly the battleground should have had alot more bodies laying around
and last but not least only being able to play six missions as a confederate and the other six as a yankee
to me playing as a yankee is like playing as a nazi in a ww game
where was the line battles where was the cavalry charges
first person shooter is great for ww and other modern warfare games but not  for the war between the stateswhen the n was the latest gaming system to be released they had the games youd expect
and games that made you ask your self what the hell is this
my brother and i bought war gods when it first came out for the n
and i must say back then it seemed pretty cool
we had many battles against each other and friends
it looked pretty cool
it was a another fighter to add to the collectionect well i recently broke out the n again and played this cart among others
you know how some games age well and others dont
lets just say that war gods hasnt aged that great over the years
others have aged worse
but war gods is not nearly as fun as it was in the late s
the graphics are choppy looking now  the cpu fighters will appear to fight unfairly
if your looking to add this game to your n or game collection in general i recommend getting it cheap
you may actually find it funmaybe youtube video footage of it to get a feel of it first
your highest replay value out of this game is going to be playing it against friends and familyi didnt like it and at such a small price just gave it to a cousin
it wasnt needed by mest  weeks it worked great excellent weight balance sumer smooth all you can ask for
after that it started to randomly turn on and off
i havent found a way to fix it yet i have another mouse connected that im using and i just see habu turn on and off all day
it seems like the issue when you reset and you have to unplug and plug again but this issue is different and of course if you go to microsoft they direct link you to razer and in razer the only support is the firmwaredriver update that i already did and didnt work at all
i tried a few forums and emailing razer support  month ago and still no answerthis is a cool product with a lot of support online however despite the online support updates etc this product still is far from perfect
almost every game i use with it initially says unknown game even though in the manual it states this rarely happens and is due to different versions of the game being released
it doesnt rarely happen it almost always happens
it is a lengthly process to get by this which the support for the product describes and even after going through it it still doesnt always recognize the game and therefore you cannot use the provided codes with itits a shame because it is a cool product and like i said its obvious that the company has put in a lot of work to provide support for it
unfortunately at least in my experience its more of a pain then its worth
beware of thisif you want to try a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game mmorpg and you havent yet this is a fair enough place to start
blizzard frequently boasts about their subscriber base being in the millions and with their mindboggling selection of densely populated servers i believe it
some games likelineage ii  th anniversarywill say things like  million have subscribed
and that may be true but they mean ever not right now
most mmos have  servers and world of warcraft wow has a lot more than that
even so at peak periods evenings and weekends you can be queued for your server meaning it can be a good  minutes after you login before youre actually able to play unless you consider watching your place in line dwindle a rollicking good timethe actual game like most mmos is vast and varied
the introductory sequence is done very well regardless of your race or class
you will be led through a tutorial without realizing youre being led through a tutorial and thats no small feat
the middle game is a bit muddy however and blizzard seems intent on making wow an endgame players kind of game
so what were left with is the high polish of introductory sequences and the everincreasing experience gains for lower levels in order to make the journey to the max level shorterthis sort of thing is where blizzard and i start to come apart in terms of vision
i playedultima online th anniversary collectionback when it was brand new and later moved on toeverquest i the anniversary edition
what i learned from the former is that unregulated playerversusplayer pvp is disastrous for your mmo community
what i learned from the latter is that rushing to the endgame levels purely for the sake of being there for that content is a sure way to do exactly one thing cheat yourself out of all the content on the waythe fact that wow has been built this way is something of a surprise coming from blizzard who normally craft such shiny things but their design is now skewed towards getting people to the endgame content faster and the attitude of the player community by and large reflects that
you may in your browsing of the auction house ah an ingame bazaar for players to list items for sale come across a fancylooking piece of armor from a set for your level  paladin for example
but if you ask people how to go about getting the rest of the set theyll most likely say you go to suchandsuch but its a waste of time just get to  so you can go to thisandthat instead
this reinforces the design which reinforces the major flaw
one reason i am much happier for having moved from wow tothe lord of the rings mines of morialotro is that lotro has a story to tell and makes the telling a joy
this isnt to say that wow has no story worth telling at all
in fact what bits of the story are there are rather interesting
it isnt told with the same level of pure artistry that lotro brings to bear but its more than serviceable and the fact that its worthwhile at all almost makes the problem that much worse
youll be alone on a populous server if you try to take the time to read the quests and make sense of events because groups will press you to hurry up theyll be on a rush to get to the endif you are after the stateoftheart from a purely gameplayoriented perspective wow should satisfy you
its flashy its bright all the buttons are in all the right places more or less and even if theyre not you can customize your user interface ui with some fairly basic programming or by downloading addons that other users have created
some of these are very basic and fulfill a single purpose
others are part of a suite of completely extended functionality
take auctioneer for example
this addon allows you to build a database of average prices on your servers ah over time so you can be sure to sell your items fast if thats your goal or for a good profit if thats what youre after
on the one hand it could be argued that blizzard has failed in some way for every addon that exists but i am on the other side of that  allowing people to customize their experience to the greatest extent possible no matter what were talking about gets you to a pinnacle of customer satisfaction
wow can play exactly the way you want it to play as far as the mechanics of the game are concernedhowever wow falls apart when you try to really put all of its pieces together
wow is about the mechanics of amusing gameplay first and foremost
everything else from story to direct customer service is an afterthought
if you want the massively part of an mmo experience wow will deliver like no other
you will not find this many people playing one game at the same time anywhere else period
if you want more rpg in your mmorpg then dont make eye contact with wow or its user community and just walk away
they wont understand you anywayi highly suggest you skip over this and purchase a nintendo original
i purchased this battery as a spare because i do quite a bit of transpacific travel
the claims for this battery are that it will give you  hours of play time
i find this ridiculous
in all of my attempts i have received a little over  hour of actual play time
while i have had no problems with it fitting into the battery slot it seems that others havethis stand was working great for about two weeks
the fans were strong bringing in lots of cool air
then i noticed a noise coming from the stand
it started out as a low pitch humming which progressed daily to a loud humming with vibration
i think it is the metal in the bottom screen just below the fans but i am not sure
well anyway i replaced the stand with the one from gameshark which i had bought before the glow stand
should have never replaced it to begin withi agree with most of the reviewers who put  or less stars on this game
its just not all there
story mode is short and i too was not clear on what you need to do to earn a gold medal in each mission
even though you did what was required in a given mission you would end up with bronze or silver medals
i finally figured out that you needed to kill a certain number of enemy and achieve a certain hit percentage but these are not given to you during mission briefingsonline play via infrastructure is truly horrible
there are only a handfull of games going on at any time and it seems like they are filled with cheaters or people using network lag times to become invincible
opponents just walk right up to a heavily defended flag take it and stroll away back to their base as a whole platoon is raining fire on them
or there are opponents who fire unlimited shells out of bazookas
infrastructure is totally lame and because of these problems it is just not worth itgraphics are good thoughi really regret buying this game and will be selling it back to one of those resale shops
dont do the samesort of disappointing considering the high price
you really dont get very much for the cost you pay
the sims  used to have santa visit and the sims  cant even  manage that
you get very little except a few decorations no lights in the window and the xmas tree you download from maxis
you can see ea is all about getting rich and not delivering qualitylike others said this stuff pack is the holiday pack from last year plus  more items
there are some lovely items but ea still doesnt seem to realize that they are shooting themselves in the foot by offering the stuff packs at 
lowering the price here to  is a bit better but not by muchthe only reason why i bought this stuff pack was because circuit city had it on sale for  between november  if id been paying attention over the summer i would have bought family fun  glamour at circuit city at those prices but i missed the sales
 i think is a fair price for the amount of stuff in the pack
if ea set the price to that i believe the stuff packs would literally fly off the shelves
every time one of these new packs come out i will be keeping my eyes on the circuit city sales flier in the paper and buy from themuntold legends dark kingdom is one of those games that doesnt have an inch of originality anywhere
its simply a game where you walk around slashing everything in sight
of course that alone is only a small bit of the problem
the main thing that makes this such a forgettable game is how the controls have a habit of not doing what you want them to do which means if a bunch of enemies are attacking you good luck trying to defeat all of them
the controls arent responsive and the whole game feels rushed
you might want to avoid this onedark kingdom is a hack and slash rpg in the tradition of baldurs gate but unfortunately the game suffers from so many drawbacks its difficult to compare it to that series in a favorable light
its somewhat amusing to mindlessly hack away at hundreds of enemies but it becomes tedious pretty fast and the gameplay and story do little to prop this title upaudience i suppose this game is meant to appeal to fans of hack and slashers and capitalize on the fan base of games like baldurs gate
dark kingdom is an unoriginal game and its pretty easy to see it was modeled after baldurs gate and games like itgraphics the graphics are okay though i dont think they capitalized well on the pss power
some of the cutscenes werent even fully animated
the background of the levels is pretty bland and repetitive and while there are plenty of special effects especially while fighting using the mage the animation falls short
i also noticed several glitches where a characters sword would pass through another character but wouldnt show the impact for examplegameplay the hack and slash nature of this game makes combat an exercise in mashing buttons but thats to be expected
this is a role playing game so you can collect gear and increase your characters attributes as you level up
you can also collect essences from fallen foes some of which restore health and mana and some of which are used as a sort of currency to upgrade your gear and purchase powerups for your weapon
beefing up a character is always fun and dark kingdom was no exception though the gear selection is pretty bland and should be considered standard fare for a game like thisthe storyline for dark kingdom is incredibly dull and uninterestinga shame for an rpg
the dialog is pretty bad as well and ranges from mildly corny to downright ludicrouscontrol  a lot of pressing the x and square buttons
its pretty easy to control your character in this game and it doesnt require much time to get the hang of
the camera which swings wildly at time and often makes it difficult to see whats happening makes this more difficult howeverchallenge this game is not very difficult to master and as far as i can tell raising or lowering the difficulty just tweaks enemies strength and doesnt do much to make the game itself more of a challengemultiplayer  this game does have a  player coop mode which is nice
you can also join in a group online which i did not trythis game is a good rental and may be worth borrowing from someone
i personally wouldnt recommend buying it since the game is short and the replay value is probably very low
with only  classes to choose from standard farewarrior mage scout it doesnt take long to expend the character possibilities you can customize of course but not enough to make it worthwhile and the world of dark kingdom is just not interesting enough to really get immersed inthis is not a good way to start up the ps with a hack n slash badlurs gate style game
the game looks and feels like a ps game and the game mechanics and playability are lacklusterif you are new to this genre look for the following games instead as they all will work on your ps and give you a little more enjoyment than what this game is worth
these games are each under as compared to the robbery of baldurs gate psbaldurs gate ii pschampions of norrathchampions of norrath return to armswell my gf and i love rpg like baldurs gate and such
we have been looking at this game and we were hoping for a good experience
we started playing then the camera ruined the game
dont buy this unless you want to give your right thumb a workoutthe endsnowblind studios reinvented the action rpg genre for consoles back in  with baldurs gate dark alliance
a game that was more diablo ii than baldurs gate but that did not hold the title back
it combined superb artwork character design and technically proficient graphics showing console owners what the hype was about action rpgsit was fast paced contain lots of replay value coop and a nifty little storythey licensed out their game engine to other developers for bgda falloutbots bards tale to lesser successthey left the bgda to work for sony to make the well received everquest spin off champions of norrath
it had the same spiffy graphics of bgda only this time set in sonys universe
they followed up con w the much more player friendly although bug ridden champions return to arms
rta had much better pacing and a deeper combat and item system
unfortunately it was loaded w game cripping bugs that actually turned many features of the game into misleading wasteful time sinksthey later went on to make justice league heroes combing bgda w the dc license
it received very mixed reviews but definitely scratched an itch for dc fans and people wanting at least some decent looking character renders of their favorite heroesfor some reason sony abandoned the well liked champions series and started a new franchise the untold legends w  psp games and eventually a ps gamethe psp games were barely mediocre at best w muddy graphics and boring quests
they tried to cartoon it up for the psp sequel and this barely improved the franchisefor the ps launch they rushed out untold legends dark kingdom
a game so poorly received people wondered if it was a bad joke making fun of the lackluster next gen graphics and been there done that gameplaysony tried something different w the ul series
instead of hack and slash built on eye popping art design standard rpg trappings and a nice paced fun balance they went instead for flashy attack combos and combat more akin to action games like god of war instead of traditional action rpg combatthe result is a game that is barely a rpg and not a very good action game eitheron the bright side it will make you appreciate baldurs gate and champions rta that much more as snowblind shows it is difficult to make the super bowl every yearuntold legends dark kingdom happen to be one of my first ps game back when i got my ps in   i picked it up along with a variety of titles that had already been released
it just so happens that dark kingdom was my least favorite of the bunch in fact at the time i beat once over the span of two weeks and havent even touched the game since
untold legends dark kingdom is not a very good example of what the ps is capable of we all probably know this by now but the game comes across as rushed and lackingdark kingdom is a hack n slash with some rpg elements such as leveling up
at first glance dark kingdom has some really desirable features in a hack n slash
it allows you to level up and improve your character coop mode minor puzzle elements simple combat system that makes the game easy to pick up and play
however the overall rushed feeling the game presents ruins much of the positives
coop has camera problems simple combat ends up leading to incredibly repetitive and almost boring combat elements and the puzzle elements really didnt provide much of a challenge
it just feels like a game that could of been a really fun hack and slash that got rushed and butchered to favor early release over qualityoverall dark kingdom is what it is a rushed early launch title for the ps
at the time i purchased this title it was for  and at that price it still felt disappointing
at the current price of   if you happen to be bored and in need of a generic simple hack and slash this might be worth a buy at that price
i still recommend this game as a rental thougha  star game in terms of fun and experience but overall value for the game falls in a  star category good for a rentalmy issue is less with the rpg aspects  or lack thereof  in this game
maybe its a problem with the playstation controller or maybe its me but even after ten hours of playing i found it difficult to control and move the character around
the camera control leaves much to be desired as well sometimes the perspective changes at the most inopportune momentat several points in the game you have to pick up and throw stuff at objects or even bosses which i found very difficult because of the oversensitive controls and the lack of a scope or any sort of targetting device or target zoom  lockon the positive side the storyline is easy to follow even for a hapless ps novice like me
you dont get stuck somewhere because you neglected to pick up an item two levels prior or have to backtrack to get it
i played the scout and liked her combat moves although you dont seem to have to aim at any particular opponent you just well hack and slash away at it
the graphics were kinda cute and the sewers the brightest cleanest ive ever seenlast but not least i dont want to spoil anyones fun but let me tell you that you will absolutely need acidresistant boots
best buy them before you enter the silver cathedrali played the championsbaldors gate games and was hoping this would be very much like them
not so
although i was enjoying the more simplified combat and item choices i eventually got to a level where it seemed that jumping onto small platforms or outcroppings was the main goal
unfortunately many of these jumps or crossings narrow bridges resulted in the death of your character if they were missed or if you slipped off one
this became very frustrating with the bad camera angles and the fact that many of the save positions were no help at all
even if you crossed the dangerous narrow areas or jumps you would have to often come back the same way and if you fell off on the way back youd have to start with your initial crossingagain
the camera angles often showed you nothing that would help youuntil it was too late
i wanted a rpg with some strategy and this game became an arcade game with poor controls and terrible sight lines camera angles
deep in the caverns dark kingdom turned into a jumping arcade game and not a good one and less of a fun rpg
very disappointeduntold legends dark kingdom is another offer from sony online entertainment along the same line as champions of norath
however it proves itself to be falling short of what gamers expect the game to bethe story is cliche full of dark arts possession addiction to power and betrayal
so you cant really expect much as they were just excuses for you to go through dungeons after dungeons
there are only  character classes you can choose from
this is quite limiting as you would expect on a ps they will allow more character classes and micromanagement of your characters
thats not really the case
you only have warrior mage and scout and thats all because the class you can choose was tied to the story line
also there is a maximum level that your character can go and after that nothing more
so there will be a substantial part of the game you will be wondering why are you fighting the enemies if you are not gaining any levels
also the skill sets available for your characters are quite limited and some of them are not as useful for your adventure at all
character management can also be done through buying armours and crafting your weapons etc
however the number of armours you can choose from are not that many and you need essence which are not really that handy to come by for certain classes if you are playing the offline multiplayer mode
in my case most of the essence went to the scout and leaving the mage on a shoe string budget most of the time
if you are thinking of selling extra armours to cash in you are not much better off either
not only most only sold for minimal amount you have very restricted space in your luggage to carry them around before you got slashed into oblivion by swamps of enemies
also with the limited level up ability of your character you would wonder why they even bother put in some runes that can help you level up quicker near the end of the game  because there is really no more level up after level dungeons are ok but some of them are so repetitive that you just really lose interest after half way or even a quarter way through
there are platformish kind of elements put into this dungeon crawler that you dont even know why they put them in except for the sake of extending the play time of this game
some of the levels are so annoying that eventually you just dont care about whether your character die or not after some time
the environments are quite monotone most of the time so there arent even anything pretty to look at
puzzles are not particularly ingenious although there are levels that important elements shown on the map are so obscure in the real environment that you could hardly see which polygon you should be interacting with
also if you want to know what bad camera angles mean in a game nobody can beat this game
a lot of time your views are blocked by trees buildings walls bookshelves etc
etc
so you can hear your characters being attacked but cant see where to counter
so you could end up just using wide attack in a corner where you have no idea what your character is doing until you see all the enemy life bars disappeared on the screen or your own characters cry of deathenemies and bosses are equally monotonous although they managed to create some bosses that really put your patience to test
for a fair share of the game you will see the same skeletons and demons coming after you again and again as you hack and slash through them
then suddenly after certain part of the game the enemy curve went up so quickly that even if you maxed out your defense you will still think what wrong have you done to deserve such brutal and unfair treatment
also they managed to put in puzzle solving inside some boss fights
so you will be busily dealing with demanding puzzles while trying to fight the bosses and their minions off
in some areas they even throw in a bit of environmental hazards that you will never be able to forget the importance of ohs in real lifethe game also has zero replay value as you cannot save your final level upd characters for the next round
so you will need to go through this hell again if you are one of the brave souls who dare to replay this gameon the whole untold legends dark kingdom lived up to its name by making it should not be told to anyone to waste time on it as it will command some of the darkest hours of your life
the orchestral score managed to help you to remember how better you could spend your time with other more thoughtful games that you could have played insteaddont even think about buying ridge racer for the ps when theres already a thousand racing games on the ps and ps that are just like this one
and for  bucks
if you spend that much money on this game you will regret it later when the price is guaranteed to drop significantly like all racing games eventually do
one day this game will only cost  bucks and youll regret spending so much on itlet me first say that i only played the demo version so i may be missing some important features
drifting is hard to get the hang of in this game but this is not the point
the physics are horrible
arcade physics is acceptable when the game has something to offer in terms of gameplay and fun
this one has neither
im sure someone who loves drifting and arcade style racing games will like this maybe
graphics are only ok considering what some other current or upcoming ps racers offer
try the demo at the ps store before you buythis is my nd outing with a ridge racer game the previous being with the original rr for the psp
i had some fun with the psp version so i rented this title for my ps
i was very disappointedas you probably already know ridge racer is an unconventional racing game in that you must master the drifting letting your car slide through corners in order to win the races
in other words you cannot hope to win any race without adequate drifting which in turn gives you nitrous boosts
while mastering drifting is not hard for the average racing fan such as yours truly the technique gets tiring quickly
its pretty much the same thing every time and after a few races youll probably come to dread cornering rather than enjoying the racingso gameplay is problematic
you may also take issues with the fact that none of the cars modelled in rr is a real car
instead they bear such silly names like age absoluto etc
this is not surprising given that the kind of drifting advocated in rr is not real at all and theres absolutely no realworld physics involvedfor a ps game the graphics is terrible
while frame rate is good the tracks which are probably rehashed from previous rr games a common practice in the rr series are surprisingly lowres
this is apparently so when you compare rrs graphics with that of the gran turismo hd concept demo which is can be downloaded free from the ps store
there are very few environmental effects and the tracks feel way too generic and unexcitingi absolutely advise against paying the big bucks for this game
if you want to relive the rr drift racing or what to give drifting a try rent the title or find a demo
in fact youll probably get more satisfaction from a ps version of the rr series since youll be paying much less for the gamerr ridge racer  and nfsc need for speed carbon are the only two full racing games available for the ps
of course grand turismo hd is available for download at the playstation store and when the full version is released it will by far be the best racing game ever
but for the time being there is no doubt that nfsc is the better racing gamei rented both rr and nfsc
i played nfsc for the entire five days i had it but rr on the other hand i only played for about  minutes and quitrr is very unrealistic and its more about drifting around corners than anything
its a total arcade type of racer and there is almost no skills needed to play the game
in addition there is no story unlike the nfs series
rr also does not have any licensed cars unlike nfsc
bottom line get rr if youre looking for a simple racer where the learning curve is about  minutes
if youre looking for a racing game that requires more skillful driving and realistic driving get nfscthis game is just another bad shot at trying to attempt to make a good gta clonestoryline is boring
not really any story at all
just stuff that looks like a story to make up for an excuse for all the excess violencegraphics felt like they more for the ps than the xbox also like another person commented on
too many live marketplace content that should have been included into the game disc
sorry microsoft but please start shipping us the whole game instead of taking stuff out right before release so you got some download content on live
at least make it free if your going to insist on taking it out of the game disc
some of us gamers dont appreciate getting nickeled and dimed to death with bogus live downloadsthis game graphic wise is beautifuland the city is huge and the weapons are alright
but once you realize all youll be doing is killing people thruout the whole gameit gets kind of stupid
thats where this game fails
your a copyou drive around killing peopleand when its all doneyou respawn everyone and do it again  thats itnothing elsenothing morejust shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot kill kill kill kill kill killi got tired of killing people after i killed the th persondefinate rentbut wouldnt advise buying unless your going to go online with itill okay
this was just a nightmare of a gaming experience
just unbeliavably terrible
just downright horrible
to be completely honest this wouldnt be a bad game for ten years ago
or maybe for  or  as a late n or ps title
but considering this game is pretty recentits downright inexcusable
so why is this game so bad
well to sum it up its extremely hard to the point of frustrating
not to mention randomly spawning enemies
thats right
randomly spawning enemies like the kind youd find in a nintendo mega man game where as soon as you take your camera view off the screen more enemies show up
and what reward do you get for killing off all the enemies in the vincinity
why even more enemies
a hit squad has been dispatched to take you out
add this on top of a game that has really no direction no storyline or even point to it and theres not even any reason to play it
it aint fun by any definition of the wordbasically youre a genetically made supersoldier who is created by the agency all of the nations law enforcement combined into one agency and youre told by some annoying old disembodied commander voice who also serves as the games narrator and the only actual character in the entire game to wipe out three criminal empires
and off you go shooting to kill literally hundreds of thousands of enemies by the time you finish the game if you can even bare it that long
all you do in this game is basically kill bad guys and jump from rooftops and while the latter may sound fun in a spiderman sort of way it really isnt
at least spiderman has webbing to control where he wants to go
you know flying would be a whole lot simplier
and easier
oh yeah
the game also has some very poorly conceived races
either a rooftop race which are usually extremely hard to beat in time or some insanely stupid driving race which if trying to drive isnt hard enough for you trying to complete a time trials race in the wrong lane will surely push you over the edgewhen you start all of your skills  agility for leaping driving for absolutely nothing explosives for bombing strength mostly just for health and firearms for shooting are all poor and barely usable
and after youve leveled up all of them as you go along in the game well theyre still extremely poor
the only thing that increases is the leaping ability in which you can go from  to  feet in leaping height
the sprinting speed sure dont increase like they say it does thats for suredriving is more or less utterly pointless in this game
 of the time youll never be in a car
which is good for two reasons because for one driving controls are really really retarded
both in setup and manuevering
thats how bad it is
bad in the its almost impossible to not run into civilians sort of way even when your driving skill is near maxed out
why they would even bother with a driving skill when the only time youll ever even drive is to either do the stupid races or mainly to travel really far distances on the islands is beyond me
but the other reason you wont be in a car much is not to hear the insansely bad soundtrack for the game
according to the ingame jukebox there are over  songs in this game and all of them are really bad third party techno tracks
like the soundtrack came out of the skeeziest clubs in europe
the game is partially european at least which is why things are referred to in the game as a centre or a lift
its odd considering that the game takes place in the nearfuture west coast america and that other things like measurements pounds height in feet and inches miles per hour are north american standard and not metric
anyway the soundtrack is really european really techno and really really bad
maybe they figured techno music is futuristic
it doesnt matter anyway because they couldve saved some money by not getting all of these crap songs which you cant cut off by the way for the car that youll rarely be using anyway
at least its nice that the car tells you how many miles per hour youre driving though as you accidently plow into an idiot civilianstrength is another almost utterly useless attribute
its only effectiveness is raising your health
but to level it up youll have to beat down on enemies using melee attacks which is even more rarely used than a vehicle
 of the game is shooting and you can only really raise your strength health by whacking an enemy with a gun or kicking them which does very little damage to them anyway
you see some of your skills are raised per usage
meaning the more you shoot the more you blow stuff up and the more you win races the higher your stats will go with  points being the maximum effectiveness level even though the bar will continue to go up to 
but youll almost never kick or hit an enemy so raising this stat is pretty annoyingthe other way you raise stats is by collecting a bunch of stupid orbs
literally hundreds of orbs scattered across literally every rooftop in the game is how you increase your agility
you dont have to collect all  of them to max out your agility though because of the rooftop races although you really wont win those much and the blue hidden orbs which increase a little of every stat
in fact those were the only way i was able to get driving and strength skills up
the driving is bad no matter what though and the strength although lets you lift and carry objects weighing tons is only useful for health
i had about  agility orbs and  hidden orbs by the time i finished the game and only driving was lower than level   to  pointsthe shooting in this game though is severely flawed
and not because of the weak firearms skills and weak firearms in the game
but by the autoaim targeting being severely broken
i swear this autoaiming never ever ever works the way you want it to
it sems to target only the most furthest enemies or moving nonenemies first and only focuses on the guy right in your face when theres absolutely nothing left to kill
while the game does give you manual shooting as well its pretty hard to kill anything thats not close up to you with it
but the broken aiming and an invisible enemy grenade that youll never even see until youre already dead are the two biggest things thatll kill you the most with this game
and unless you really get into this crapfest of a game you will die hundreds upon hundreds of times
i only had it on normal difficulity and i died like  times within any given hourall the guns are pretty weak and when i found it about late into the first gang and location i wound up using the harrington hmg  rifle throughout the remainder of the game
you only get two weapons to hold at a time throughout the entire game by the way
the problem with all of the serious firearms is that theyre power is compensated by an extremely low clip or insanely slow reload times with the harrington being the slowest
i counted the reload time of this thing
six seconds
now picture that
in the heat of warfare having to spend six whole seconds just to reload the low clip on this stupid gun
count to six and thats how much time youre waiting inbetween fire
in six seconds you could lose all your armor and health and straight die while waiting for this thing to reload
and yes being you only have two guns and some grenades throughout this whole game i tried the call of duty style switch to your other gun as you run out of ammo instead of reloading tactic only for that to not work as the stupid generic character youre using automatically reloads the gun when you run low or run out so in order for the call of duty trick to work id have to watch and make sure i dont go below ten bullets left and then switch to the other gun in order for it to work as the characters autoreloading is completely and totally uninterruptable
so annoying
why should a player have to endure crap like this
throughout the whole game i either used the harrington despite its insanely slow reload and some kind of rocket or grenade launcher as anything else would be ineffective have too small of a clip hold too little of maximum ammo or simply be just too weak
sounds fun doesnt itthe characters in this game arent even characters
theres you the generic namelss agent
maybe agent is your actual name
i dont know
theres the disembodied commander narratorboss guy wholl remark such sayings as go like the wind agent
and simply pathetic
when you die
having the game insult you every time you die and dying because of some stupid glitch or flaw is enough to make you want to break the game disc into tiny little pieces
the bad guys are perhaps the most generic looking criminal bosses ever
its like they looked in an la phone book to get names for the spanish lieutenants
there are three gangs that rule the city but theyre more like criminal empires because street gangs dont have that many soldiers and they dont actually run entire sectors of a city and its inhabitants
they are  los muertos or the dead pretty clever eh
 the volk and shai gen or generic spanish gang generic russian gang and generic chinese corporation gang
the key members of the gang like i said are about as genericlooking as generic can get and when you actually find out where theyre located and kill the hundreds of bad guys guarding them before you realize that they keep randomally spawning and that you should ignore them and just run towards the main gang lieutenant and kill them youll be rewarded with nothing in the guise of a slightly higher ratio for success
you see the game developers thought that itd be clever to make fighting the main gang leader virtually impossible and that you would have more fun by taking out key lieutenants who each enhance the criminal empire be it by firearms number of soldiers available vehicles etc so that it becomes slightly easier to take out the main gang leader
but even when you kill everyone else and save him for last its still virtually impossible between the miles long approach to their headquarters the endless spawning soldiers and the enemys eight life bars
like most strongholds in the game youre best to just run past everyone trying to survive and just go all out on the major gang leader before all the minions kill you
screw weaking their health or minimizing their recruits with killing the lieutenants because they wont do much help for you regardless
but then i guess the game would be too short
in this case though thatd be a good thingi should also bring up that the map is even messed up
yes thats right
even the map is a pain in the donkey
not only is the map horribly outofscale with everything else and not only does the map not provide you with any gps or waypoint marking but you cant even zoom it in
the map on the menu screen is just a tiny little map on the menu screen
you cant zoom it in to see closer or anything
and the arrow representing you on the map takes up an entire city block in reality meaning things that you may think are close by may be two blocks away from you
how often is it that you can say that the map in a video game is one of its many many flaws
okay so you cant zoom in use a gps or even accurately know where youre at
surely the hud radar map must be better right
nope
the biggest problem is unlike any other game that uses an onscreen map theres no n for north
just four arrows any one of them could possibly be north
theres a reason why they dont put the south east and west on these and this is why
you never know where youre going
i cant tell you how many times i had to pause the game just to figure out which way was north
i often had to look one direction pause to see the full map to see where im facing on it and then turn again until i got to facing north or where ever it is i had to go
how could they not have even gotten this right
it also wouldve been helpful if being you spend most the game on the roof to know which enemies were eyetoeye level with me above me or below me
usually they make all things above you an arrow facing up on these game maps and all things below facing down
but oh no not in this game
i died so many times because i couldnt tell if any enemy gang were shooting from above from below or from so far away they wouldnt even show up in the compass map screen
every single enemy is just a dot
even if theyre above me or below me
its things like this that make you appreciate the little things in any given grand theft auto title where you dont have to try to figure out where north is and that the arrows or triangles let you know right away which altitude an enemy is at
but not in this game
in fact ive seen an effective map system in about every xbox  game that uses one except this game
oh and you cant even zoom the map in
inst that just something elsewhen you die you have to restart from a supply station most of which are few are isolated between locations and all of them have to be found and unlocked
oh and theyre all on roofs meaning you have to spend ten minutes climbing up top to them and you could die just trying to get down from them
an elevator that you can use once you get up to the top the first time wouldve been nice
i mean they actually have them in the game and all so its not like they wouldve had to make one from scratch or anything
any good gun you collect from an enemy has to be taken to this supply centersave point in order for you to keep it or else youll lose everything you collected once you die
sometimes because of the random enemy pop ups youll ironically die trying to get back to your save point in order to save the guns you just got in case you die
you could be at any given rooftop look one way then look back and have a hoarde of random enemies pop up at you
sometimes you can even see them materialize in front of you
sometimes youll restart at a save point and by chance therell be a ton of enemies right in front of your face as you just come back from the dead
i dont know
maybe killing so many enemies as if they were an ant colony and jumping from rooftops sounds fun but its really not
neither is dying a thousand times due to a broken aiming system or enemy grenade
you can still die by gravity by the way so with each roof you still have to be very carefulthe only good thing i can say about the game is that theres no glitches
oh wait
there are
like constantly getting stuck in a wall or a rampway or even the ground
stuck as in this solid object isnt all that solid stuck
and the random enemies
that counts too
its bad enough that once you kill every enemy in the near area the game will have a hit squad of about ten cars come up and bring more enemies to you but to have the ones you just killed rematerialize right in front of you is just insulting
like why even bother to kill them if it just makes more come to kill you and the dead ones simply return back like its nothing
your character is a genetic clone and the agency can make an endless supply of you in case you die
whats their excuse thoughoverall this kind of pointless d shoot and jump kind of simplistic game wouldnt have been so bad on the n the original playstation or even as an early gamecube title
i mean the comicbook like art style isnt anything impressive or new or advanced
 to  this game mightve been acceptable
an average game at best
but this kind of simple pointless storylineless linear shoot and kill just for the sake of it game is far below what todays standards are in gaming
to imagine that this is an xbox  title makes me think that this game probably spent so many years in development that its heavily outdated by todays standards
when you cant even tell which way is north on your compass map you cant even zoom in your menuguide map and every single character is as generic as a white and blacktext can of government corn it really isnt a game ready to be released
at least not in any year past  on any system greater than maybe gamecube
this game is bad for simply being simple and outdated and just really frustrating and lame and incomplete
i cant give this game a one because other than the getting stuck and targeting there really arent any glitches or bugs in it
the game is somewhat playablehowever when a game makes you want to break something in its incompleteness or lose your mind and curse after getting killed by some stupid game flaw for the th time something aint right
i cant imagine anyone over twelve enjoying this game not to insult anyone under thirteen but only a simple minded person could enjoy a game this simple and generic
by the cover and art style the game looks kind of cool
you sort of think gears of war combined with saints row
you get to use some high tech equipment to take down three ethnic gangs crippling the city
sounds fun
and im sure most people who bought this game bought it for the halo  beta but also because it looked or sounded like fun right
however i havent played a game this bad since sonic heroes
and i would include every other sonic game since then had i actually played those alsopoorlyrated titles this is a game you simply want to break with your bare hands or sell to any gaming store even if you can only get  for it
shoot any amount of money the guy offers you at a game store youll take just to not have this horrible curse of a game in your life anymore
i cant say its a legend in the worst games of all time ranking but its definitely one of those games youll get rid of by any means possible just to not have in your collection
its like the dvd of gigli or i know who killed me in your dvd collection that makes everything else you own as well as yourself look bad just by its mere prescence so you get rid of it possibly erase all save files of it from your memory card or hard drive too and pretend like it never happened
yes this game is a pretend like it never happened kind of gameavoid this disaster at all costs
its not fun its frustrating and its not even indepthits a grand theft auto type of game
in that its a fairly open world
it was disappointing that some places i couldnt go in to and i thought i could
meanwhile there were plenty of places they created little nooks and crannies just so you never know which one will hide and orb
you honestly start to feel as if somebody went click happy with placing the orbs
itll take longer to find those last few orbs than it will to find the first half of them
for that reason alone it gets held backalso the  points they want you to shell out for the downloadable content thats  if you buy the points straight from microsoft is stuff that should have been included in the game
then on top of it there are a few new achievements that were added that you have to have the downloadable content to get them
the saving grace about all that though is that if you do coop with somebody that has that content purchased then you can use that stuff that would otherwise be locked to youif you arent rentingbuying this for the halo  multiplayer beta then you really shouldnt bother with it
its an insult that they are charging extra for stuff that should have already been included with the gamethis would have been an ok game for the xbox but for the  its very weak  the settings graphics etc
are all sif halo is a  this is a  save your moneyim not going to try the expansion pack because the original game left much to be desired especially in regards to server signal strengthi bought this game years ago and it was one of the worst games i have ever played
i am only writing this review now because amazon sent me an email recommending itthis game is just terrible an insult to the legacy of yoshis island
it is best summarized by probably its biggest issue this game uses both screens of the ds for gameplay but the space between the screens is also used meaning that there is a blind spot in the very center of the gameplay
it is nothing but frustration when you keep getting hit by enemies that come out of nowhere from that blind spot and especially when you play the levels with moving platforms you find yourself being force to play with your character in that blind spotany platformer that thinks its okay for your character to be invisible knows nothing about good platformingi also remember disliking the bosses but its been so long that i cant quite remember whyi had played ouendan the japanese game this game was modeled after and while they play basically the same the original was much better
this is primarily due to the fact that the soundtrack for elite beat agents was terrible
the songs in ouendan were popular jpop and had fairly catchy tunes
elite beat agents uses either unheard of or ancient songs such as ymca
basically it seems like they just looked for the cheapest music licenses they could find
it could have been an awesome sequel for those of us who played ouendan but instead it ended up being a major disappointmenti bought this game the other day and all i can say is this version is pure garbage
the songs dont seem to match the agents when they dance to the beat
do yourself a favor and buy the original osu
tatakae
ouendan
this game was lost in translationin pretty much every other respect except graphics fuzion frenzy  is the better game
this is still fun and playable but offers nothing compelling in terms of gameplay or minigame variety
and ff is backward compatible on the  so unless you really dig the online action id say go with it insteadwhere ff  ff the minigames have a good variety and are easy to pick up and play
tournament mode gets you planning how to come out on top in the end whereas minigame frenzy focuses on just winning individual minigames
in tournament mode each zone has its own minigames and final battle
theres no board game mode like mario party has
the six characters play identically and have forgettable personalities
every minigame is player freeforall unlike mario party which also has player v v or v gameswhere ff  ff custom matches give you more flexibility in configuring yor contest
online play lets you get in a player match of any brand anytime
the rumble minigames are cool but not as cool as the originals fuzion frenzy match
the achievements are very easy to unlockwhere ff  ff ffs announcer wasnt much less cheezy than ffs but ffs dj varcanno is always yapping
you can mute and skip his timeconsuming dialog in singleplayer mode but not online
another lame ff feature is the cards which seriously take away from actual minigame skill in deciding tournament mode and add only a cheap comeback chance
finally the fuzion frenzy match that capped the tournaments in ff are gonegeneral there is nothing outstanding about fuzion frenzys brand of minigame action
when it cuts to the core the gameplay itself it is quickly satisfying as long as you have other people to play with
if you like playing online its worth checking out
otherwise find ff for way less money or just avoid the series altogether
youre not missing out on anything specialfuzion frenzy  is a party game comprised of a bunch of minigames
i adored the first fuzion frenzy game for the xbox
how does this one comparethe minigames are different and i just dont find them to be as much fun as the original set of games
i suppose its like anything in life  that when you have a wide open field at the beginning you can do the best you can do
once those are done and you have to choose from the not quite good enough for the next release they just wont hold upthe characters have been stripped of personality
in the original game i actually got fairly fond of zack and naomi and so on
i liked choosing my favorite character and playing against all comers
but here youre now just player  or player i bought this game when it very first came out and was so disappointed that i put it on the shelf
its now five years later and i gave it a fresh try to see if maybe my opinion on it had changed
maybe i was unfairly comparing it to the original that i adoredunfortunately no
i still found the gameplay tedious
a main part of the issue is the long boring intro and midsequence videos that they show
you have to slog through them before you get to the actual gameplay
you can skip some of them but not all of themeven if i were to say good for minigame lovers  why wouldnt they just get the original fuzion frenzy which i loved
i could play fuzion frenzy for hours and hours if i was in the mood for minigames
there wouldnt be a reason to put this one in the system instead
and with so many other minigame style games out there that do it well even if one didnt like the fuzion frenzy universe for some reason there are a wealth of other options which are more fun to playi just cant recommend this game
you could rent it from a rental site if you want to see what its like and who knows maybe one of those minigames will connect with you and become your personal favorite
we all have different tastes
but for me i just dont have any reason to keep hoping the game eventually grows on merating i purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this reviewi loved the first game
this one not so much
some of the games are mildly entertaining but the presenation and mechanics ruin it
the cards are lame and can ruin even the best playerbut nothing drags the experience down like the announcer
he simply wont shut up
to be honest after about  minutes my friends and i turned this game off and popped the orignal in never to play ff again
if they had a game where you got to smack around the announcer for points i might have given this game another star butive been playing flight simulatorsdogfighting games for over  years
i can honestly say this is the most frustrating ive ever played
the controls are like lead and the missions become difficult right off the bat
poor instructions and objective add to the frustration as you will spend a great deal of time just figuring out wtf you are supposed to do
i had to resort to walkthroughs just to survive the training mission
the game is also buggy and froze on me more than once in the brief  weeks i wasted my time on it
save your money and check out the ace combat series insteadone of those either you love it or hate it
its ok my grandson loves it so we keep it
a shootem down is goodfirst of all everyone buying this should be clear this game is not a flight sim
janes wwii fighters for example was a wwii combat flight sim
this is nothing like that in spite of some other comments here in amazon reviews
there is no attempt at realism it is an arcade game with inflight repairs health restoration and other arcade features
there are no gauges for air speed and altitude no artificial horizon none of thatso the question becomes is this a good arcade game
i love flying games in general be they arcade or flight sims but i cant say i love this one
for the  currently being charged its not bad but if you paid  for this a few months ago then there are probably some game owners out there with some regrets
its definitely not worth first of all the control scheme allows for many setups but all of them can be difficult to master since any flight game even an arcade flying game works best of all with a joystick a real joystick not the little thumboperated thing on the nunchuk
while one of the simulation modes allows for the tiny joystick to be operated like the joystick flight stick control in a flight sim fine manoeuvres with just your thumb on the tiny stick can be difficult to master
nevertheless this is probably the best setup
wii remote controls can be wonderful for some games and terrible for others
i dont believe that wii controls generally work well for flying games and this one is no exception
some people will find the controls okay while others will find them near impossible to master
it can be very difficult to finely manoeuvre your aircraft in three dimensions with just your thumbsecond the dialog during the campaign and arcade type quick missions is truly terrible
after an hour of playing the game it was literally driving me crazy so i turned the sound on the voices down to make them inaudible
that at least is a feature i really appreciated being able to turn the voices offthird some of the missions can be difficult simply because its unclear what exactly is supposed to be done to accomplish them
this can lead to frustrationfourth missions cannot be saved in midmission
while there are checkpoints during missions that allow you to start again from a completed checkpoint this only applies while the game is currently running
if you back out of the game or turn off the console you will have to fly the entire mission over again to complete it
arrgghfifth the one good point of the game is the large number of planes to be unlocked as there are more than  however differences between them are strictly related to things like how much damage they take speed firepower etc
while these would matter in a flight sim as well there are no real differences between the planes that one would find in a sim such as ceiling turning radius etc
unlocking planes can be tricky though because some of the missions are quite difficult to figure out or completethis game is just okay and i only recommend it if you like arcade style flying games and you can buy it at no more than very bad if you mess up there is only one save point
at the last level it appears there is a glitch where many game users are having a problem with reloading the level nevada dam  warehousewhere you see irena thru window  then game crashes destroying the one and only save point
this has happened to several users
according to ubi support you must delete the one and only allowed saved game and reloadrestart the game from the beginning again
i tried this twice and it crashed twice
so i gave up
ubi programers need to learn how to allow multiple save pointsoverall the game has good picture quality
content ok but for ps there are no updates
so i advise buying it used and trying iti love the original roller coaster tycoon game and the first sequel is even better if very very similarhowever for this version theyve updated the game to a d viewpoint and changed a lot of things from the classic games
to keep this review short i just dont like it very much
there are advantages to a fully d roller coaster game like being able to ride the rides and better view of the area and track when building rides but it just doesnt work for metake a look at the original games rct and rct on the website great old games if you really want a rollercoaster and amusement park management gamesom new additions not in rct r great lik the pools and slides menu organizeation is more complacated and over thought out guests glitch and get stuck in large crowds and cant move this causes ur employees to get stuck and rides and paths r not kept workingthe more popular ur park the worse this issue gets no mater how u organize ur park rides and paths guests will b pushed into anmil enclosers and may b eaten or dround if pushed in waterthis game was recommended to me by a friend who also loves real time simulation games
next to the simcity franchise this is one of the most popular and wellreceived rts games out therea little backstory i started playing sim theme park  back in  that was and still is a very fun simulation game
one of the best in my opinion
i feel the mixture of realworld accuracy and fun gameplay even though very cartoony was executed perfectly by the developers
furthermore the overall aesthetics and art style of the game are very appealing to mert however is a jumbled overlycomplicated mess in my opinion
the ui does not flow well and the item menu layout makes it difficult to manage your park
most importantly there are just way too many options to play with
everything and person in the park has a fullrange of options to tweak enough to make an ocd person go absolutely nuts lol
i fully support realworld accuracy in these games but i also understand that its still a game and i want to have fun playing it
and the developers definitely went fulltilt making rt as realistic as possible
some people will no doubt love this but i think that most people coming from simcity or sim theme park will find the game far too micromanageythe sandbox mode is fun but since money is not involved you quickly lose motivation playing it
whats the point if you can build anything you want immediately
the campaign mode is not what i expected i was thinking it was more along the lines of sim theme park or simcity where you start with a lump sum of money and an empty park and you build your park from there managing it along the way to keep a positive cash flow
instead the campaigns are somewhat preformed giving you a basic park that you takeover management of
not very exciting in my opinionoverall the game is not as fun as i had hoped for
if they allowed users to let the park run more autonomously perhaps an autopilot mode if you will with the ability to tweak various items if needed that would be better
or as an alternative provide advice to the user on various aspects of the game ie
people find admission prices very cheap people are not satisified with the quality of ice cream offered etc
in its current state however i dont want to go through my  hot dog stands and adjust the amount of mustard on my hot dogs and have to guess what the best selling price would be based on the insignificant amount of financial data the game provides realtime
the concept is great but they just strayed too far in to the weeds without providing enough framework to allow the player to adequately adjust all of the optionsthose coming from simcity or sim theme parkstyle games beware you probably wont enjoy this onepor fin la mejor version de rct acaba de salir
con esta edicion platinum no solo se obtienen las ultimas expansiones y el juego original sino ke tambien se corrigen ciertos bugs de ediciones anteriores y ke no eran tan completos como estei was told fear is a super scary thriller
my wife and i were excited to play it with all the lights off hoping to have the bejebus scared out of us
after  of  intervals only the gameplay was scaryfear is a patchwork quilt of gameplay and story elements that have already been done and done better by someone else
thats not to say that a marvelous work of art cannot contain influences from previous masterpieces but if you just stitch together pieces of famous works by monet rembrandt  vangogh youll wind up with something appalling not appealingthe enemy soldiers sound just like the soldiers from the original halflife
alma appears as a young girl with her face obscured by long black hair
remind you of the ring
maybe the grudge
paxton fettel eats people like a resident evil zombie except for the thin premise that he doesnt do it for nutrition he absorbs their memoriesspeaking of thin premises lets talk about slowmo
your characters reflexes are so fast that you can slow down ingame time
thanks to the part about reflexes that doesnt sound anything like max paynes bullet timehealth dips into the original dooms bag of tricks complete with a max of  points each health  armour that is unless you pick up health boosters that add  pts to your max
what is this 
oh and heaven help you if you pass a checkpoint with low health
also borrowed from doom were messages left through the game
except instead of watching clueladen videomemos like doom fear offers voicemails from one plant worker to another who asks are you alright
we heard loud noises
there was one trait that was unique to fear you cant always just pass over ammo  items to collect them
sometimes yes but most times you are forced to press and hold xwas there fear in fear
apart from the occasional boo
moment no not really
like the rest of the game scare tactics were recycled and repetitivei cannot recommend this gamei just played dead space and enjoyed that well enough so i thought id give this a try
i like shooters i like horror games how could this one not be right up my alleywell theres just not enough to either the shooter elements or the horror elements to really hold my attention
the shooter side of things is okay but the enemies and missions are really repetitive
your objectives for each new interval are pretty much always just keep looking for that guy youve been looking for
as for the horror aspect thats just weak
there were parts of resident evil  half life  and even fallout  esp
the dunwich building that were scarier than anything i saw in this game and those games all had a ton of other stuff going for them beyond the scary bitsi think the reason this game falls flat for me as horror is twofold  playing a soldier fighting other soldiers will never be scary in a game because the threat is too easily understood  guy shoots at you you shoot him  the part of this game that could be scary because its so much of an unknown the eery little girl is too front and center to be any kind of a shock
i mean shes on the freakin box art
when the kid in the shining turns the corner and sees those twin girls just standing there thats genuinely creepy because you have no idea who they are or what theyre capable of
youve basically got the kid in this game figured out after the opening cut scene some psychic experiment gone wrong  check
 so any surprise is just about exactly what kind of powers shes going to throw at you
you get the same level of uneasiness going up against a boss in a zelda or mario game for the first time
this game does offer a few basic halfseenmovement and jumpoutofthecloset scares but those would be way more effective if they didnt start the game by telling you exactly what was behind themthis is good enough if you can find it in the bargain bin but even then youd probably have more fun just playing some multiplayer matches in a game you already ownwith me being a fan of monolith studios condemned criminal origins i must confess this game pales in comparison to condemned
i really didnt care too much for fear
it just seemed to me like monolith just wanted to release this game in a hurry to get a quick buck
the graphics are horrible and the controls are cheap
the graphics look no way as detailed as condemned was
i hated the annoying head bob feature although it did have a tweak setting for it but when the head bob was turned down it looked the walking function of the player just looked cheap
its a big disappointmentit seems like i might be a minority here because i did not like this game
in fact i got bored with it and didnt want to finish
graphics and sound are very nice for the psp ill give it that
but over all i never felt too much fear here
immersion is the most important part of a survival horror game for me and i simply wasnt immersed here
i also didnt like the combat system
the idea that you get  swipes with a weapon before it breaks was lame
some might say well that adds realism
sure  a scalpel isnt a real weapon but we are playing a fictional video game
this games only real addition to the style of play they really did keep to the traditional silent hill formula otherwise here is durability of weapons
they overlook realism however when youre able to carry a tv a toaster  broken boards a tire iron  scalpels a katana and  guns all while runningdisappointedthat pretty much sums up my feelings about this gamei dont usually write reviews but i felt i had to say my bit on this titleit is a very pretty gameill give it that but little elsedoax  doax  better graphics  novelty features  in person multiplayer  some reason to play the gamelets see we have the new eye candy mini gamesneato if you love button mashing madnesswe have the new jet ski racebig yay thereits an entertaining diversion but nothing overly specialgot old for me quickthe new casino games are oki spent more time playing in the casino than anything elsewe have online multiplayer nowwoo hoonow you dont have to worry about making real friends and inviting them overyou can just play with whatever random person is out there on the netwe have online multiplayer at the expense of the offline two player gamethat pretty much kills the game for meone of the biggest components of this game and the previous title is going about gathering all of the bathing suits and other goodies for the various characters in the gamewith the old game whenever a friend came over to play a two player volley ball match you could show off the various outfits you had acquired make inappropriate comments about the ladies whine about losing because of the control scheme and enjoy your company in generalwith the doax there is no offline multiplayer game
no local two player mode
i guess the people who made this game figured that the players who would play it didnt get out enough to know any people in person and those they did know they only talked to over a crackling headsetwell that wasnt the case with me and my friendsbetween rounds of halo and soul calibur wed pop in doax for a change of pace and everyone liked itthat was the part of the game i really likedthe social aspectthat made me want to collect all the different outfits and items so i could show them off and hear my buds comment on them
it gave me a reason keep playing the single player mode which in no way had an elaborate storyline
and i enjoyed it
i really diddoax was a gemand while doax has a pretty face there is nothing shining behind the eyesall in all even with the online bit you are still alone just playing with yourselfthis game is the same like the first one for xbox
the only new thing is just jet raceing the rest are the same they could had done more then just put partial nudity cause this game got boaring quick
when i first heard this game was comeing out i thought their was going to be more fun and exitment but when i played it i thought i was playing the first cause their was nothing really different exept jet raceing and some new music witch i didnt really care for
the jet raceing was a little fun it wasnt that great but the rest was just the same
the same stuff include vollyball pool hopskotch relaxing near the water buying new clothes and figer and nail polish and thats it they just added jet raceing
so this game was no good they should had done more in this gamethe good super sexy good visuals fun minigamesthe bad very hard to make friends terrible english voices extremely simplei dont mind sexually driven games but i like them to be good and done right
xtreme  is the sequel to xtreme beach volleyball for the original xbox
everything is in tact with a few additions
the consists of  minigames and  casino games but thats not enough to save this simpleminded gamethe whole point of the game is to play minigames with other doa ladies and earn their trust and friendship and this is harder than it seems
the game plays similar to a japanese dating sim game and it can take forever to buy a lot of the items and learn how to become friends with these lovely ladies
you have to figure out what each lady likes loves and hates and send them gifts accordingly
all you get is a visual guide for each lady with pictures of what they like but this doesnt help much
after you spend a whole two weeks at new zack island you pretty much give up trying to gain trust and friendship since its so hard to figure out without some indepth guide
after a tries you end up just playing the minigames and ogling the scantily clad women lying around and even dancingthe minigames are the most fun of the game with pool hopping flag running beach volleyball jet skiing and water sliding
pool hopping consists of pressing the buttons according to what is shown on the floaties
this game tends to be very hard since it requires precise timing
flag running is pretty simple but the best game is probably volleyball
it has tight mechanics and controls and can be a blast to play
jet skiing is very mundane since its the same track over and over again however the water effects are nice and doing tricks on the ski can be fun
water sliding is the hardest game of them all since its so hard to stay on the slide and after you fall off you dont get another try
after you earn enough money from playing minigames you can purchase a camera and take sexy photos of the ladies and view them later in your albumthe casino is the second major part of the game that lets you really earn some bucks
all the games are pretty selfexplanatory roulette tends to be the most intense but you can lose all your money in one go if youre not careful so watch how you spend your money
the casino is all in d so its nice to view but i wish you could walk around in it and see all your doa lady friends playing in there as well
when you earn enough money you can go buy stuff at the store to give your lady friends or yourselfthe game really has no purpose except to ogle your favorite doa girls and trying to buy the skimpiest bikini for them
the graphics are great and everything jiggles in all the right places
the audio is pretty mundane with japanese audio tracks to cover the horrible english voice actresses
the game isnt serious but it could be so much more and i just hope doa xtreme  becomes more deep and involved
i just wish there would have been more interaction and all the load times dont help either
the game is just to hard to figure out with the whole dating sim thing going on so just sit back and enjoy the women and minigames
the game will make you choke your chicken for sure so doa fan boys girls
should pick this game up and enjoy its simplicitydont bother
the best part of the game is the intro movie that leads up to the title screen
it goes all downhill from there
the controls of just about every game just dont really work all that well
trying to get these girls to be your friends is just not worth the aggrevation as they always get mad and leave you for seemingly unknown reasons
and then you need to have friends to play volleyball so you end up stuck just lapping around a lake in a jet skii will be honest in that i only gave this game about an hour of playtime
if there is more to unlock if you stick through the annoyances i dont know it isnt all that clear
but i cant see anyone actually giving this game the time to really progress in the gameso youve seen the ridiculous trailer for this game heard the hype and read the unkind mocking reviews and wonder whether you should give this game a shot
well that all depends
im a huge fanboy of the fighting games which get a bad rap by folks who havent bothered to learn how to play them properly so im a bit biased by the fact that i really enjoy these characters and the ways their personalities and relationships with one another carry over from gametogame in the series
that said this game certainly does live up to its affectionate nickname boobs the game but there is more than a little bit of fun to be had on zacks tropical island
the original doax was a novelty game at best that offered nice visuals a minor diversionary volleyball game a boring casino and a busted social sim
this time around we get really nice visuals a slightly improved volleyball game several extra annoying minigames a muchimproved casino and a pretty killer jetskiing game on top of the stillbusted social sim
youll spend most of your days earning money playing the two good games vball and jetskiing so that you can attempt to buy thoughtful gifts for girls youd like to be your friends
the problem is that the girls will usually return your gifts for no real reason making your precious time and money a complete waste
while it is quite fun to see the girls who do accept your generous gifts wearing them around there are very few items you can give them repeatedly and the overall item list is quite a bit shorter than i expected
the incentive to woo these girls is nil unless you love a headacheinducing challenge or are without a volleyball partner
i was really hoping for a major upgradeoverhaul to this pointless social sim but chalk that up as another disappointment
the muchvaunted swimsuits are mostly nothing special and they are impossibly expensive though they do leave tanlines when you change to another which is a very nice touch
the casino now has a much better variety of games that you can play headtohead with the other girls the poker is quite fun which is probably the biggest improvement to an existing aspect of this series
the waterslide buttbattle tugofwar and flag racing minigames are all over in a flash not very profitable exceedingly difficult and take up a massive portion of your day making the lot of em damn near worthless
the jetskiing and volleyball are really the games biggest saving graces and are pretty damn fun once you get the hang of it
i got frustrated a the vball at first and cursed my partners terrible ai that spiked at inapproriate times and often watched an opposing spike or serve go by as she looked at the ground
then i remembered that kasumi and ayane my doa girl of choice do not get along though i had tried to smooth things over between them i could practically sense kasumis indifference to the outcome of our matches
so i kicked kasumichan to the curb grabbed a new partner and promptly began crushing the competition
team ninja loves this kind of thing adding hidden depth to a game that appears to the inexperienced eye to be simple and impossibly difficult
treat your partner right and youll work together nicely lose games and skimp on the gifts and youre game will suffer as a result
another nice touch
allinall this one is barely an improvement over the first installment and therefore still a renter
the game is fun for quite a while but watching the same canned animations bouncy breast physics or no and hearing the same phrases over and over gets old quick so the graphics and doa characters are no reason to buy this game
added social interactions would have done wonders here but alas giftgiving is the only noncompetitional contact youll have with your friends unless you count the timewasting be friendly activity where you watch you and your partner stroll down the beach or do other boring things while you snap pictures
the new minigames are all lame and since the social aspect is still difficult and unrewarding id really only recommend this one to a fans of the originals volleyball game who dont mind the redundancy  b boys who will not know the touch of a woman any time soon and dont have access to porn  c anyone who actually gets excited at the prospect of a virtual jetski race or poker game and  d doa completists who absolutely must collect every single item in every single game that team ninja puts out or just cant get enough of those delightful doa girls
everyone else should give this one a rental then go dust off your copy of dead or alive  a mans game and kick some real virtual booty
lets just hope that doa code cronus doesnt let us downmissed potential is the word hereawesome graphics and hardly any fun a bad combinationthe worst part is the fact that this could have been a great no fantastic game so frustrating to see that happenstill its got merit pick it up cheap if you cani bought this game looking to expand beyond simple puzzle games
my biggest issues are the graphics are too tiny to really see whats going on
so the game pieces are hard to move around
i think if you want a computer version of the games buy a version for a pc where you can see better whats going on and have more controla neat idea but not suitable to the tiny screen of a dsi bought the game thinking that it was great like the reviews always have been spreading to people
but when i bought the game i could not help but feel really bored by this game
i hope some people had more fun with this to me this game felt repetative and the controls were very clunky
and i dont know about the pc version but the graphics for the ps did not feel so nextgen to mei borrowed this game from someone out here and im sad to say that i have brought all three ports for the pc and was blown away how each game was a step up from the last but when i got my hands on this one just to see the difference i was shocked and let down but i also have to remember that this game was debuted on the pc first and that was almost a few years ago but expecting some of the bugs to be cleaned up at lest for the ps would have been nice but got let down on some of the graphics which were no better on my pc which loaded faster and played better
truly this was my first let down on the ps and i hope that its the lasti had very hopes from this game as i really liked the xbox version but it is not so good for ps
the graphics and gameplay shall be improved a bitits still a kid heavy game
battle system is quite simple
you walk around smashing the buttons to kill bad monsters
weapon system was a strong point in the game finding items and creating a weapon out of them
i would avoid this gamethis game is awesome but it is also way over hyped by the video game junket ie
everyone who depends on vgs to pay their salarythis is not a  id give it an  at most
there is just not much to do thats all that fun other than the missions which get repetitive and due to the horrible handling vehicles can be a tedious lesson in frustration
i can count at least a couple times ive tried all the missions available and found all of them this way this one doesnt keep you playing like sa did
the motorcycles are almost unrideable and you are forced to use them in at least  missionsso handling sucks the fun out of it a lot
also the character is so slow in almost everything he does runningchanging weapons stealing cars etc
the cell phone is more annoyance than anything you are constantly inundated with calls for nonstory things if i wanted the sims id play that
ditto for gran turismoforzathis is like a product with a very sexy package only to be just a generic inside not worth close to  this just turns me off of rockstar in the future it seems like no one remembered what made gta so fun to begin with
after a few years of waiting its a real let down yes rockstar got its m on this one from everyone but the next one ill pass on buying new
my advice is to wait till this comes down to its actual value about i liked this game when i first brought and played it but then i relized its just the same like the other gta games
all you do is run around do what you want carry weapons in your hand shoot people beat up people steal cars the police comes after you and you no the rest
the graphics is nice but that really dont matter its the game play that counts you can fly a helicopter but the thing is the police just come after you when you fly one and you cant go in not much stores exept bowling pool the bar clothes store and thats it
gta is a really repetive game with the same stuff but different character to play as and different storymode but the rest is the same so this game is getting boaring not much i really care about this game anymorethe game is in great condition and played by my ps perfectly but the game just wasnt too controller friendly
the steering wasnt no where near as accurate as the previous editions but it does have a good story line at least as far as ive got
if it werent for the handling of the car this would have been a better game
i had no problem when the guy was out of the cari have played grand theft auto  with the full inclination i would be able to do all that which the great san andreas laid out for the player and more
this would not be the truth
with all the capabilities of the ps why did they not make this happen
i played through it thinking the game would redeem itself but really it trudges along taking it self too serious and not having fun like the rest of the gta family
worth playing through the story i guess but i found myself thinking havent i done this before in a more fun way in sa or even vice city
i barely made it through the first playthrough and im headed back to san andreasive played all the gtas since  loved em
why
gameplay plus story
the pinnacle was san andreas
awesome gameplay mechanics
epic story that carried through during the entire game
whats missing in gta 
the story
characters like brucie and little jacob are developed and then dropped almost entirely
other characters roman and your old now gay friend are simply annoying
there is no consistent bad guy  nemesis per se
in san andreas you had the corrupt cops antagonizing you from the first scene to the last literally
your grove street amigos woozy and others were woven into the story in meaningful ways throughout
gta  lacks all of this
i felt disconnected from the plot and was simply driving over there shooting some guys driving over here shooting some guys driving back over there shooting still more guys and soforth
worth a play through but leaves you wanting much much moreafter a few days of playing i finally had the words to accurately describe my feelings towards the muchbeloved gta iv gta iv is like that friend you had when you were  you thought he was cool because he wore the latest pair of air jordans gratuitously and uncompromisingly dropped the fbomb and was fun to hang out with in short bursts until he started to get on your nerves
the review on this site and many of the users on this site have given gta iv a perfect rating
i have disagreed with some highlybeloved and highlyrated games in the past most notably halo particularly numbers two and three but i find that giving a perfect rating to such an obviously flawed game is absolutely egregiouslet me explain  first off with this being the next gen of gaming many games try to pass of snazzy graphics as a cloak to disguise horrible game design
i find this not only to be true with gta iv but i dont even find the graphics that appealing
in every cut scene i watch i cringe at the modeling done on niko the main characters face
it looks like his face is made out of leather that cant be reshaped in any way
the lighting on his face is weird as well as he seems to have a such a constant spot of light under one of his eyes that he might as well just be wearing a bandage there
i am a few hours into the game but ive really only found one maybe two characters that i found believable to the point where graphics pretend to be nowadays where i almost thought that it was actually a person who was recorded and not a digital image
i know i may take heat for this later on so let me remind the readers i do not rate games on graphics purely for their realism
i rate games based on the look they were going for and what they actually pulled off
here i feel that gta iv fails
additionally in the options menu the game has a brightness setting which i turned to the brightest it could be and i still have trouble distinguishing the finer details at night such as cars people turns poorly lit streets etc
i have also outdriven the draw distance on this twice
once was nothing major just a few barrels on the side of the road that popped up out of nowhere
however the other was about three or four seconds of me driving on a gray slab with generic block walls on the side of the street before the game caught up and rendered the textures
this in this day and age of high technology where foreground and background textures can be buffered as you are approaching different areas is entirely unacceptableas with all of the gta games the sound is superb
the radio stations and the street chatter are all of an excellent quality
some of the voice acting is absolutely atrocious though
the main thing that bothered me though was not so much the voice acting but the dialog that was created for the characters and street chatter
this is where i actually picked up the previously mentioned reference to the year old
i have absolutely no problem with profanity and will casually drop a fourletter word here and there with no second thoughts
however even i as mentioned find the use of this to be to quote what i said in the first paragraph gratuitous and uncompromising
its hard to listen to a character and take them seriously when all they do is drop those bombsthe value of gta games is always high with a high amount of missions sidemissions and hidden packagetype pickups
as this game is not currently holding my interest i will probably not pursue   i dont even know if ill complete the story more on that in a bit
update to this  see below
however there are plenty of things to do in liberty city and you can even take your game online for multiplayer matches if thats your thing
i personally dont see the appeal of online play like this unless its with a couple of your friends or to make new friends
this battle anyone just to become number one even if it means dealing with cheating and giving up your life outside of the game mentality thats sweeping up gamers these days does nothing more than perplex me
however for me this game held virtually  value as i not only have no motivation for  but no motivation to even complete the storyah  the gameplay  ive been licking my chops in order to rip into the game as this has been the most frustrating part for me
ill get a few of the good things out of the way first every car that you are in will trace a path to your objective destination or waypoint via your gps system
this can really help you learn the city and find the best and quickest routes
the aiming is improved and you can even take cover in addition to crouching
however i find it to be nothing other than a broken control scheme if while autoaiming from behind you can manual aim by moving the right analog stick and then fire using the o button which also must be hit with the right thumb
i guess you can try holding r with your middle finger adjusting the aim with your thumb and firing with your index finger but were not all doublejointed
since you cant move left analog stick when youre behind cover i guess it would be too much to ask rockstar to use that as your manual aim or to still use the right for your manual aiming but have the option to press r to fire
i wasnt sure where to put this next point so i guess here is just as good as anywhere
as your character is russian but speaks predominantly english he will occasionally toss in a few russian phrases which are translated in the subtitles
since the chances are highly probable that a majority of the people who play this game will not be fluent in both russian and english would it be too much to ask that the russian translations be put up on screen as a forced stream subtitle
again i guess it would
another thing about the subtitles is that one of your contacts speaks heavily in jargon which is either standard speak for jamaicans or a stereotype of said standard
i remember in vice city your jamaican contact spoke exactly the same but those subtitles were not only translated into normal english but were only during cut scenes
i cant understand one thing this dude is talking about whether or not i read the subtitles in addition to the fact that its difficult to read them while driving at top speeds
that brings me to my biggest complaint about the game the driving
the mechanic is drastically changed from the previous gtas
in iii and vice city driving was fun because while it wasnt crash into anything you want to without due regard or consequences a laacute the need for speeds it definitely had an arcadey feel that i found comforting in the fact that it was easy to get used to a bit of a challenge but still fun
the new driving mechanic feels more like something out of gran tourismo
i dont consider chasing after someone or running from the cops touching the ebrake for a split second to make a sharp turn and spinning out of control a full  as i crash into everything in site and wreck up my car to be very fun
i also dont consider it fun when im going over a bridge and i dont stop to pay a toll and have to spend the next five minutes outrunning the cops before i begin my next mission
yes  paying a toll
another yeay for realism boo for videogaming moment that i had was having someone chasing me and shooting at my car and watching not only my cars health but my characters health decrease as well
yeah great random bullets are hitting me but when my car gets trashed from both bullets and the atrocious driving mechanic i now have to go running around the city trying to jack another car while at or below  health
another thing that bothers me is the introduction to the story
in gta iii your character gets doublecrossed on a bank heist
in vice city it was a drug deal gone wrong
i wont even bother mentioning san andreas  i was not a fan
here i watch as niko goes on his first date early in the game and telling the girl that hes trying to keep his nose clean and try to start a good life in a new country
then i watch as the next two missions he drives someone over to a lockup with some hot parts in it and then watches over a drug deal with a gun at the ready
what is his motivation
the final thing that irks me about this game is the friendship bullcrap that you have to deal with and the other pointless junk put in the game
you can take your friends to bars grab a bite or even take them bowling or to play darts
not only is this an aspect of the game i find to be tacked on for no good reason yes you can get rewards from them but let me finish but its already annoying me early in the game and i only have three people to please in addition to having just met a few more
and those rewards that i mentioned are not permanent
yes just because you earn a reward does not give you the right to say ok mission accomplished  onto the next friend
no if you ignore your friend and the status drops below a certain point not only do you lose the reward but its harder to get back than it was to get in the first placeas i would assume is obvious right now this game is not very important to me or my collection
the only reasons i am trying to complete at the very least the story are because ive heard that its very good and im still a year later trying to justify my purchase of this  piece of hardware thats done nothing except allow me to replay my ps games with wireless controllers
after dropping  on this on a preorder no less although i did save on shipping im now looking to hitman splinter cell only a temporary  exclusive god of war and resident evil to be my justificationactual score gameplay graphics sound value tilt it took me a while but i finally got gta  well it wasnt worth it
ive owned the game for a couple weeks and im already bored
why
because its basically the same as gta iii vice city and san andreas
the same missions same types of storylines same weapons same vehicles same buildings same same same
if youve already played the previous three games in the series you will burn out on this one quick
how about opening the game for us a bit more
why not let us go into more buildings interact with random people in ways other that beatingkilling them make some decisionstake the storylineending in different directions and customize our character instead of forcing us to be a white male russian douche bagi am surprised gta  got so many great reviews from the gaming press
as a game itself sure its pretty great
but as the fourth installment of a series where all the previous games were the same it semisucksok bought this game last week been playing itand i gotta admit the graphics are spectacular really i aint crazy about this gameway too much hype for a feeble attempt at a game
ill take gta vice city any day of the weekthe good awesome graphics cool carsthe bad cars are impossible to control
slam into everything
 hard to see the game lighting sucks extremely boring gameplay camera angles suck fighting  punching seriously sucks music stations suck
one rock station
come on controljoystick issuesyou would think by now with all the technology we have that video game companies could make the punching  fighting a bit better
come on
is that too much to aski starting playing grand thef auto iii over my friend stevens house when it came out
i finally got my playstation  back in  just so i could play it along with grand theft auto vice city  and grand theft auto san andreas 
i was amazed at vice city cause now i can punch vehicles and fly helicopters
i was even more amazed with los santos san andreas cause now i can upgrade my respect autotarget people when i wanna fight perform sealthkills with a knife upgrade my weapon skills manually aim all my weapons autotarget enemies with the assault rifle upgrade my vehicle skills recruit homies for certain missions go to driving school boat school flying school and motorbike school fly airplanes and jets and parachute out
for  years ive been so hyped up about grand theft auto iv cause of the graphic and i thought i could do even more things but this is what i finally got my playstation  for
i have a easier time controlling claude than niko
oh yeah i can autotarget but instead of standing up to the police i have to run outta the flashing area to lose them or they just shoot me instead of them pulling out their pattons and me knocking them out
niko puts his hands up and surrenders to the police
tommy cj and claude never put their hands up for the police
what a disappointment
wheres the fights with the police
wheres the melee weapons
wheres the mm and shotgun
wheres lazlow on the radio
ill finish the storyline but after that its going back to gamestop and im sticking to los santos san andreas
grove st  lifei highly recommend that people rent this game before buying
i honestly dont get why its rated so high
i was so bored while playing this
the controls are difficult and when you walk the screen always jumps to the wrong direction
fighting multiple opponents is so awkward
i stopped playing it because i was so bored
i first had to pick up some girl and take her bowling
then after that i had to take my cousin to a strip club where you have to fight multiple opponents
it wasnt fun at all
it also froze on me a couple of times and i had to try to restart the psone of the most boring games for ps nothing originalbetter safe your moner for another game like red deadthis game is fun but really disapointing due to the fact they game states that you rarely ever see the same people twice which isnt true
the cars are limited that you dont have much of a selection and you cant fly a plane which is a huge disapointment not only that you cant even go into the airport
you cant enter most bulidings but grand theft auto claimed you could
it doesnt live up to anything they said
they still have a long way to golet me start by saying i am a pretty big gta fan so im not lashing out against fanboys as i was one myself
that said i am completely amazed that so many people think this game is so great
it is far from it
it isnt the worst game i ever played but it has the same game play problems that have plagued this series from the beginning
chiefly poor controls terrible camera and slowjerky character movement
i swear all of these things are even worse in this installment that vice city or san andreas
when not running nico moves ridiculously slow and walking or running on steps is horrendous
lets not even talk about melee or shooting if you can lock on to a target as advertised i sure havent found the secret
rock star could take some tips from third person shooters like gears of war
i realize gta isnt really a third person shooter but there is no reason they couldnt make that piece smooth enough to be one
combat is not fun in this game it is down right annoying
the cell phone drives me insane
it rings constantly with inane chatter and it is almost impossible to see depending on the background at the time
i have played with all of the video settings and i still cant see the freakin thing  of the time
there also isnt anything new here that is fun unless you think watching tv playing darts or pool or going to a strip club inside a video game is fun
i personally dont
the story is somewhat engaging but the rest of it is too boring to hold my interest
yes the graphics are breath taking but at this point in the next gen game market i expect this
it should be a given
bottom line there just isnt enough innovation in this first next gen gta for my money
i played through about  of the game and just couldnt take it anymore
i just lost interest
save your  and rent it for a day instead
better yet play it for free at a friendsthe graphics are very good
sound is ok and the controls are fine but the game play is too linear and uninspired
maybe it was designed by commitee
another bad point is the plagiarism of another game
after about  minutes of play i realized this game is very much like parts of halflife  only not as interesting
the voice of the propogandist even sounds like the one in hl  the time shift properties add some interest but overall it is a rather insipid game
the game designers need to make the stories interesting to draw you in so you care about the characters and what happens
if you have not played very many st person shooters it will be fine otherwise its  been there done that
ok for the graphics controls and sound are fine
the artwork on the case is really cool looking
butthis game is a shooter without a story plus time shift ability
no plotjust shoot
no character developmentjust shoot
i played for about  hours and then got bored with shooting everything in sight
i agree with the other reviewers who gave it  stars and  stars
this game is uninspiringits boring
i would much rather replay a game that i previously played and enjoyed than spend my time playing through this game oncevisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsthe game fells like a hastily finished effort that didnt come close to its potential
none of the characters introduced in the cut scenes is ever developed
the puzzles involving time control are really silly and contrivedno thinking required
and the endingwell there isnt one
the game just kind of stops and suddenly youre staring at a credits screen when you were expecting a huge end level or boss fight
this cant be how they planned itsomeone just pronounced it done and pushed it out the doorat some point the developers should have realized that the crossbow was way overpowered and at least severely reduced its inexhaustible ammo supply
once you get that the games difficulty drops by half and stays there making the first quarter of the game the most difficult
the bolts have infinite range and explode like grenades
you can take down whole screens of baddies when theyre millimeter specks in the distance by shooting them each once in the toe
can you handle the suspense
the game could just as accurately be titled super crossbow man
or maybe the crossbow of uber pwnage and the guy who has it
crossbow should be in there somewhere is all im sayingthe time shifting thing has been compared to max payne and prince of persia but both of those games did it better
max paynes time distortion really felt like bullet timetimeshifts feels more like a cheat code
and pops time reversal constantly saved you while in the very process of dying or even post death
but timshift is very quick to kick you out to the load screen the micro second your life bar hits zero with no margin to rewind as youre hitting the floorthe only thing going for timeshift is some pretty nice level design
i never got tired of the really creative environments they kept coming up with
and if you resist using the crossbow of instadeath and stick with lesser weaponry you can have a lot of fun in the firefightsi love fishing games
at least i thought i did
this latest game by activision however really has me questioning that statement
it is a mix of mediocre graphics crummy sound and boring controls that makes this game a dudaudience  im a fisherman and as such was able to figure out what the drag settings meant and had a decent idea of what to change my lures to
i have to agree with other reviewers who say this isnt for a nonfisherman thoughthe ingame instruction is so poor that i imagine it would be tough to figure these things outgraphics  poor even by wii standards
the level of detail is pretty disappointing and the rendering is justwell it seems like it was done about  years agogameplay  you go out on a boat and catch fish
there are tournament modes of course but basically its just all about catching fish obviously and little changes there
to the games credit there are several locations and an interesting variety of fishcontrol  this is what really bothered me about the game
the casting mechanism makes decent use of the wiimoteyou hold it up and flip it to cast
so far so good
reeling can be done by holding down a button or with the nunchuck actually holding the button down was less tediousgo figure
but what gets me is the sheer lack of need to really control whats going on
before a fish hits you just reelnothing more
after setting the line which is incredibly easytoo easy in my opinion and hooking the fish you just reel and essentially drag the fish to the boat
there are times the fish fights a little and you have to move your rod or loosen the drag but overall the actual fish catching experience is pretty boring
the worst part however comes when you try to land a fish
upon getting it to the boat the screen darkens and a little net interface of some sort appears on the screen
landing a fish has something to do with moving a yellow circle over a silhoette of a fish and pushing a couple buttons
what that has to do with catching a fish is beyond me but it frustrated me to the point of turning the game off more than oncechallenge  it varies i guess
sadly most of the challenge for me at least came when trying to compensate for the poor control system and lack of instruction from the very inane fishing companion
that to me is the hallmark of a bad gamewhen trying to overcome the games flaws comprises most of the difficultyrapala tournament fishing is like a fishing trip gone bad
if youve ever been fishing and been frustrated to the point of wanting to throw your rod into the water youve felt some of the emotion i felt while playing if youve ever been so bored while fishing you almost fell out of the boat you experienced the rest
there are a few mildly amusing moments when you catch a large fish or when you pull into a new area of water to fish but overall this game is very disappointingthis game lacked everything that fishing fans were hoping for
it felt like i was playing bass pro  no wait that was betterthis game sort of blows
the lures dont act as they would in the water and they could have done a little more with the animation of the fish swallowing the lure
glitchy controls and the fishing caddy tells you what bait to use and where to fish if you listen to him
id rent it if you are really into real fishing
other than that it is pretty much a comercial for rapala productsi love fishing and so does my dadwe thought it would be easy with the wii but this game is horrible
we also figured with rapala being a big brand in fishing they could create a good gamenope
for  minutes you spend trying to fish you catch nothing and spend  more minutes and its just horribleas the other reviewer points out the graphic quality on this game is very subpar
it seems like a very old port with updated wiimote controls added in
gamecube games on average had such better resolution i have no clue why the heck this game got released as it isthat aside this game is pretty average in terms of gameplay
i had fun with it although it does not merit its price tag as is
when it is in the clearancediscount bin this game will be a pretty good catchi bought this based on the good reviews
my yo son was very disappointed in the game
it sounds way more fun than it actually is
glad i bought it cheepi know i must be really crazy to give the playstation  an overall rating of  stars
hear me outfirst of all i must be the only one who happens to think its a total scam that the dvd player built inside the playstation  was never recreated to work properly
its really a bad business move on the part of sony to never listen to all the phone call and email complaints that were directed to them about the dvd players inability to work correctly for most people
the honest truth is that the thing never worked right
sony probably didnt fix it deliberately because the playstation  was selling so well and continues to sell they probably figured they didnt need to bother
furthermore the dvd player was probably added on in an attempt to make the ps smear the competition which admittedly was a strategy that worked because the gamecube has been knocked out and the xbox never became as popular as the pseven if you ignore all the negative opinions on the dvd player you cant ignore the fact that the console itself had other problems
many times the playstation  would overheat and that would cause the games to stop working momentarily
this becomes a problem the longer you play a game because the ps was never designed to run for long periods at a time
so what this means is that its not right for you the consumer to have to purchase a playstation  for more than  bucks in my opinion
thats just an unbelievably high price for a gaming console that may or may not work correctly and also includes a shaky dvd player
if you buy a playstation  you wont know what to expecti think the biggest problem i have with the playstation  is probably not really sonys fault however its somebodys fault
im talking about the absense of innovation
when the ps came out there really wasnt much left in terms of groundbreaking new features in the world of gaming
all those extraordinary innovations already happened on the playstation one
really the only thing the playstation  had going for it was more hours of gaming and better graphics over the psremember all those playstation one games that were so revolutionary
silent hill final fantasy  resident evil  metal gear solid
those are the main ones
those games appeared on the ps in all their influential glory which means when the sequels to those games were released for the ps really all we had were updated graphics and longer gameplay
you see compared to the playstation one the ps had better graphics and the games took a lot longer to complete which granted is a good thing
however updated graphics are hardly a revolutionary thing by todays standards
in fact im convinced talking about good graphics in the year  is pretty pointless
you want to talk about innovation
how about the jump from d to d
this happened on the playstation one not playstation  now that is what i call a revolutionary step forward in gamingspeaking of d games want to know another reason why the playstation one was better
because it featured a perfect blend of d and d games
the ps wasnt created for the sole purpose of dazzling gamers with amazing graphics
no the ps was created for showing gamers how to have fun with a game in addition to the realistic revolutionary step forward into the land of d gaming
the playstation  was unfortunately just a seemingly neverending stream of boring d gamingyou see as someone who grew up as a teenager with the playstation one i can remember clearly how people approached gaming back then
we didnt go into each game with the mindset that each game had to have incredible graphics we went into each game just expecting to have fun
thats how we judged video games back then
when a game with incredible graphics came along such as resident evil  and final fantasy  we treated them with open arms just like we did with other gamesyes its true that back in the ps one days we put the games with exceptional graphics on a different level from the other games but we did not criticize the graphicallyaverage games just because graphicallysuperior games were available at the time
we treated games with good graphics and belowaverage graphics equally as long as the average or badlooking games offered enjoyable replay value
and guess what
most of the time they did
thats how you appreciate a video gametoday with the playstation  people are so concerned with only great graphics that many times the gameplay suffers as a result
this means that yes the playstation  smears the playstation one in terms of graphical power but when it comes to actually having fun with a game along with the previously mentioned allimportant innovation aspect of gaming the playstation one absolutely destroys the ps
so overall the playstation one was not only more fun but also more important
the playstation  ruined the mindset of gamers that every single game had to look good and for that i will forever look down on the playstation  the wwe wrestling series is now worthless for example
however im not angry with sony directly because the ps was phenomenalheres the worst thing about judging graphics in a few years everyone will change their minds and look down on the playstation  for having horriblelooking dated graphics
yes it will be the same people who once praised the graphics too
i guess thats the price you pay for judging the way a game looks and nothing else about the game
you watch in a few years the games people consider cool today will have no purpose to exist according to themas for longer gameplay experience thats overrated too
why
because its entirely possible that a minute game can be just as good as a hour game
i strongly disagree with the people who think theres no excuse for short games to exist these days
no
a game shouldnt have to take a long time to complete
the longer the game the more boring itll inevitably be and the less likely youll care about it years from now because youll remember how much work went into actually completing itanother playstation  complaint i dont like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad
using an analog stick is annoying because you dont feel comfortable with it
ask any older gamer they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad
with an analog stick you slide all over the place
in addition to that disaster the ps controller also suffers from too many buttons
we shouldnt have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game
the playstation one had the best controller ever
it was comfortable you were always in complete control and it just looked betternow with that out of the way lets talk about the only worthwhile thing the playstation  has going for it a few good games worth purchasing
grand theft auto is probably the biggest series on the ps and guess what
its good
its great in fact
its innovative too the only important thing the ps ever had
unfortunately with games like saints row on the market the uniqueness of grand theft auto is starting to wear thin because of all the unnecessary copycatsanyway besides that game what you can expect to find if you own a ps are many and i mean many missionobjective army games world war ii games and maybe a few lackluster platformers here and there
oh and we cant forget about all those boring racing titles that are designed to appeal to graphic freaks and not to people who actually like to race
the silent hill and metal gear solid series were also pretty decent but in the case of silent hill improved graphics dont necessarily mean spookier more interesting gameplay
the original will always be the bestif you like shooting guns and racing cars hey the ps is your new best friend
but if you want something more seek a playstation one
the playstation  is just a long list of mediocrity
thanks for ruining the funif you can find a more sleek design get itthis is the original controller for the xbox originali bought it to replace one that was brokethis one is huuge though and not comfortable to the hand
they have smaller ones and i would recommend them instead this one is just a clunkeri recently ordered this adapter to replace my lost one
the reviews were better than others although i didnt read them which i should have so i decided to give it a try
it came in on time but when i opened the package the adapter was in a cheap plastic packaging bag
it does have the nintendo logo embedded in it so i dont think its counterfeit but this is still unsettling
it charged my ds nonetheless and that is all i really need out of the product but this is very misleading on amazons part
and no i did not order from a private seller
i ordered straight from amazon
 star for the timely shipping
 star for a working product
quality and professionalism are nonexistent here and i wasnt completely satisfied so  stars dropped there
bad form amazon
bad formi am an avid soccer enthusaist so when i purchased the xbox  i awaited eagerly for the arrival of a soccer game worthy of the next gen fifa however not only dropped the ball but they stood on it sat on it then let all the rest of the air out until anything fun about playing soocer on a console was flat and dullthe first things i noticed was the lack of teams the earlier reviewer was right only  leagues many countries have been left out much to my dissapointment one of fifas attributes was the fact it was licenced with all the leagues and teams throughout europe and beyond now we are left with a meagre  leagues so immediately that killed a lot of my enthusiasmthe gameplay still isnt there the atmosphere feels very linear not helped by only  camera angles another let downthen comes the skill levels there is a huge difference between amature play amd semi pro so much so in fact youll be in limbo for a long time
the realism of players colliding is absurd as you find  players going for the ball at the same time simply bump off each other knocking them back a few paces now call me cynical but i have yet to watch a soccer game were two opponents going for the same ball butt chests and take a few steps back before going back inwhich actually leads me to my next pointtackling a major part of the game is devoid due to the fact every slide tackle you try to do will more than likely automatically give away a free kick or penalty  of the time so that button is immediately withdrawn from my thumb as a useless tatic and addition leaving only the x bottom to put your foot out the steal the ballthe players likeness is left the imagination of someone who i can only assume has never seen any footballers in real life because most players dont have any or much similarity between the real life player and its gaming counterpartthe commentary on the other hand was great peter brackley and andy gray cough up some good dialogue that isnt repetituve and one of the few points that actually adds to the game lacking nearly every other aspect of soccerthere is no training mode to work out moves and practice special moves which isnt really a problem cause there are very few special moves anyway and the spare right thumb control stick doesnt do anything helpful or special except stare lonely at you wishing it had a function in the gameoverall this game has gotten worse over the last few years but this years version has to be without doubt the worst yet
i have traded my game in already and i am waiting patiently on winning soccer to make its debut sometime in feburary from previous experience winning soccer has better gameplay more moves and now it has more leagues than fifas poultry please rent this game before buying if after a few weeks your still playing its probably for you and you can go out and buy it but for all others a week is usally enough before you get to the point of sighing heavily hitting eject getting back in your car with game in hand looking for a trade inget back on track fifa you used to make really good soccer games what happenedi didnt enjoy this game at all i would waste my money on it if i had the choice again
the gameplay isnt too fun at first its ok but thenif the game is so great why isnt there a decent trailer that shows the actual gameplayyou can go online and see reviews about how great yesterdays games were alsoi can read  positive reviews but i still wont buy a  game until i can see the darned thing  at least one second of game playcome on dont tell me all the marketing money was wasted on a teaserhaving immensely enjoyed the other two games in this series and having been overinundated with positive reviews for it i made it a point to add it to my wishlisti was sorely disappointedwhile the graphics were updated nicel and some new intriguing elements to gameplay were added like the ability to actually interact with nomadic tribes i have added this into my category of sorely disappointing sequelsive spent about  hours of gameplay and ive unlocked almost all of the secrets the game has to offer using the exact same strategies as the previous two titles in the series
the replayability factor is low for me simply because of the fact that i had long since worn out the previous two titleswhile someone new to this series might be enchanted with the way this game is presented anyone who has spent time on the previous two titles would be better off spending ones money elsewhere
even at  i feel i overpayedthe darkness is one of those hyped up games that fails to deliver
its yet another first person shooter fps set in new york and the alternate reality of the darkness  a demon which posses your character at the start of the storytheres a lot that this game does have going for it  the facial graphics are really outstanding
the levels designed in the hellish alternate reality of the demon are really nightmarish
theyre a tad cliche but well executed and i never was bored looking around in those levels
some of the kills using your demon arm are strangly satisfying although the standard executions are very poorly animated and just look plain sillythe gameplay is very standard for a fps
as many reviewers have noted there are a variety of weapons but theres rarely any reason to use any weapon other than your dual pistols
the ai is nothing special and will generally let you hide and recoup your health and simply stand its position and let you pick them off one at a time
since your powers depend on darkness much of the game is spent shooting out lights
annoyingly there are very few light switches to simply turn off the lightsthe multiplayer on xbox live lags something awful
if you manage to spend more than a few minutes online your patience is greater than mine
this feature was probably tacked on last minute and adds nothing to the games valuethe worst part of this game is the way you have to travel from level to level
you travel between parts of town most often via subway
in the subway you cannot kill or be killed and its mostly there to get you from one point to another and occasionaly move the plot
the problem is that often youll complete a mission then go back to the subway then have to travel to another subway station and then go to a new level  and god help you if you take the wrong subway or get off on the wrong platform
each time you move from level to level theres about a minute or two loading
the point is after you complete a mission it can be five or ten minutes before youre back shooting stuff up
the pacing is maddeningthis game wasnt bad for renting
the story is mildly interesting and some of the gameplay was ok  but this game will soon be eclipsed by other games and i seriously doubt anyone will be playing this game in six monthsnot a bad game but looks alot better on the ps
buy it if you only have a  and you dont get a multi choicelame first person shooter
the walk speed is too fast or something because this game also made me feel dizzykeyword boringgraphics greatabout as repetitive as assassins creeda friend just lent this game to me and i think the graphics are excellent with the first thing you notice jackies reflection in a mirror
watching to kill a mockingbird the subway system the village voice boxes  finding letters dialing various numbers you get on ads and bizarre cut scenes
all very strange with a interesting lead character
targeting system is horrible but not a major complaint because you can still kill the bad guys very easily
as someone mentioned in another review the darklings dont do squat and the twins trying to search for openings or clues later in the game is total and complete failure on the developers part
motion sickness andor vertigo will take over
the map doesnt show you exactly where you are only the area and gives you a vague clue as to what you are looking for or the objective
at times this game will move quickly and other times its crashes down upon you with boring and frustrating game play puzzles
ive never played anything like it but hours of this headbanger ultimately isnt worth itthis is a good game which is nearly ruined by the game controls
it is tough to turn and move with the controller maddening
fortunately the darkness ii has corrected this problem
but i am still playing the first darkness game near the end
but be warned i am a stubborn man
in addition to the lousy game control programming there are parts of this game in which you find yourself wondering where the heck youre at how you got there and what do you have to do to get back to normal
there is nothing to compare to the frustration you feel when you are wandering around without a clue as to your whereabouts and trying to find your way to someplace you may not know
it sounds stupid i know but its how this game plays
the really good part of the game is the personal reward you feel when you have made your way past these hurdles and you know whats going on for a change
heres a short scenario of a portion of the game  you walk into a place and  wham
 you end up in wwi trenches filled with zombies
its dark and how in the heck do you get out of this mess
in this section there is one point you end up in the hills in which lots of bad guys are shooting at you as you stagger around trying orient yourself
theres no clear indication of what you need to do nor where to go next spoiler alert youve got to climb a hill find a cross and talk to a crucified man hanging upside down get a couple key items then find your way back to the village from which you wandered
later in the game youre back in modern times chasing a bad guy across rooftop ventilation shaftsoh those x game controlsbottom line if you have patience like difficult puzzles and have a modicum of dexterity youll probably enjoy this game
if not change the channel  darkness ii is far better in its design and executiondont trust the listing it isnt a microsoft product
the packaging makes it look like an official product but the lack of a authenticity hologram sticker and the dodgy looking disc full of outdated drivers are two major clues
then when you plug it in and your computer says unknown device you know something is definitely wrong
eventually after downloading the official software and fiddling with it for a bit it does work but its no better than the cheaper wireless receivers that dont pretend to be microsoft productsit is a decent product its well built and i didnt have any trouble installing it on my laptop
the problems arose while i was actually using it though
i use xbox controllers with epsxe pj and a few other emulators and while a corded controller gave me no problem with those my wireless controller is constantly getting dropped by this
its a nuisance that i think is entirely hardware related
i should have purchased an oem receiver instead of this or another corded controllerthis is a horrible chinese knock off
if you do buy it make sure you can buy the real thing later
it was hard as hell to install
like another review said you need to update the drivers and install it as a microsoft common class receiver
it does work and i have no issues with my  wireless but i give it    months before it breaks or just stops working
do yourself a favor buy the microsoft one for  bucks more
it does however work once you get passed the installationat first i thought it would be novel to play online without the hassle of wires so i spent over  on this
it turned out to be more annoying than it was worthit is heavy to support on your earit is annoying to rechargeit is difficult for your  to locatetrust me save the money and just use a headset like everyone elsethe earloop design is a little unsettling at first but with a little readjusting it will fit quite comfortably for many people anyway
it does happen to be twice the size of most bluetooth headsets currently available but since this is the first wireless headset for the xbox  ill give them a little bit of leeway
also the lightweight nature of its design somewhat negates this fact
the unit also has no problems connecting with a  controller either
the real fault actually comes from using the headset on xbox live
you wont really notice any difference hearing other people than if you are using the regular wired headset but the microphone is just the way too sensitive
while hosting a number of games i noticed every once in a while there was a player whose microphone would seem to pick up a constant string of background noises if not the player breathing himself
that players mic always seemed to be constantly sending feedback or white noise as if they were constantly rubbing up against the mike
i now learned that it was actually a byproduct of the wireless headset itself not the fact that someone just had and oversensitive mic
now that i knew the problem was in fact the wireless headset itself i found that the only thing you could do was to turn it off and then back on again which would alleviate the problem
depending upon which game youre using at the time this might happen to you at least once every two hours
yet on other games it might not happen at allits nice and having a wireless headset but if you like to play a lot of xbox live  hours a week you might just want to stay with the standard wired headset
it might have an extra lyre going from the headset tier controller but if youre like most people you probably dont really find it in the way that much
unfortunately since microsoft has proprietary technology on any wireless product will have to wait until they decide to fix the problem themselves
honestly just find yourself a normal headset for around  and youll never have any trouble because even though the wireless headset has dropped in price recently its really not worth the frustration at even 
besides well probably see a streamlined wireless headset version for microsoft not too long from now  then we dont need to deal with that earloop thingthe sound quality is great and when the mic actually picks me up it works quite well as well
the problem comes in when im in a game with auto sound detection like uno where you just start talking and it filters out all the what it thinks is just noise about  times ill start talking and it wont turn on
also my battery life so far has been nothing close to the  hours it promises coming in closer to  i bought this because i couldnt stand the headset that came with the  i love the one that came with the live on the original xbox but im finding my self disappointed with this as wellits you plus  other superhero characters working as a team you get to choose what superhero you are and you can change to another superhero just about anytime
this is a third person shooter
i only tried the single player campaignits hard to see what you are doing in the game since the characters and objects are smallthe aerial camera view means you cant see any characters facetoface
there is very little zoom
and you cant see very far in front of you
so when you do spot an enemy they are almost right in front of youthe maps are repetitive
movement is a chore probably due to the camera view
my character frequently runs into obstacles or other superheros when i click to go somewhere he cant even go around a corner by himselfthe storyline is weak
what is the overall plot
i dont know
you just get tasks like diffuse a bomb stop an attack here turnoff a reactor there etc
but why
its just fighting bad guys here and there as they popup
go here do this go there do thatbut no overall plotthe dialog is weak
you hear the other characters talk to you but you dont talk back to them you just read your lines on screen
that was disappointingthe superhero personalities and costumes are fun but there needs to be more than that
the graphics are finei was bored playing this game so i stopped playing it
it just wasnt fun
it didnt hold my interestvisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsthis purchased started off great
i was able to play my games just fine and the buttons were responsive
after about  month the a and b buttons stopped working
i eventually purchased another one from a gaming store that was in much better condition
luckily i got some utitlity out of it before the buttons stopped workingthe nintendo ds is aimed for kids
most of the third party games are really weak
you can not count on this system for d graphics
to date metroid prime hunters is the best graphics on the ds
the only reason you should buy this is for the flagship titles mario bros pokemon metroid
overall there is not that much for this system
it is ideal for d games only
even when the developer does a good job with a d game the game still looks pixelated due to the low resolution screen
the ds has no way of running media unless it has a modsoft modwhich make this system alot less entertaining
overall if you are looking for a portable console the ds is not the thing for people let me start of by saying i have had this keyboard for  years
however out of that  years i have really only mainly used it for about  yearsi really dont like this keyboard at all
first of all its loud as heck
you dont even have to type any letters as long as your fingers are just barely on the keys they make a ton of noiseits not that comfortable either i mean when you type you have to press harder on the keys than what im used tothe programmable keys however are nice
but i never really used them as much as i thought i wouldanyway just get razer black widow instead of this old thingi dont see the cons of a tarantula keyboard enough in print
if i did i would not have bought mine
i pluged my nice  speakers into the keyboard and moving my keyboard broke my cord
nice speakers no more
i do not plug my expensive replaced logitech z into my keyboard any longer
the keyboard is illuminated but not the keys most used wasdzxcfgrshiftcontrol
they have a place for a raised light to sit
like i want a lamp for my keyboard
next time i buy a gaming keyboard it will have the correct keys illuminated not a place for a lamp
consider the cons before buyingas a buddy of mine said after i told him i purchased this game of course you did
ive enjoyed quite a few of these games and i was thrilled at a different developers take on the game on the ps
so where to begin
the camera is jumpy as all hell the lock on system is a joke the difficulty is borderline impossible unless you start off on very easy and work your way up and even that can be frustrating at times the frame rate is complete garbage and the sound actually crackles not my speakers but the sound design itselfto elaborate the camera follow is like many games a pain in the ass
since your direction is determined by the camera view you can veer off while attempting to look left or right while you are walking or boosting  across a level at an enemy
this of course is a huge hindrance while attempting to make very tight and specific maneuvers to avoid taking hits or just to reach an objectivealong with the camera system or arguably lack thereof the lock on system is reliant on the camera
if your target is on your radar but isnt within line of sight there is no way you can get a lock
ever worse if the enemy leaves your line of sightframe you lose your lock
this will cause some major frustrations while enemies use you for target practice while you attempt to find the guy you were wailing on earlierthe difficulty of the game is one of the most bizarre things
i attempted this game on normal and couldnt even move on past the training mission
i swallowed my pride and played through and upgraded the mechs and continued on from difficulty to difficulty till the game was just absurdly easyaside from those key factors this game really isnt terrible
it gives the player decent control over the mechs like sniping key spots of your enemies and actively blocking incoming attacks with your shield
damage is also specific to areas of your machine as well so that you can disarm them to the point that they are a torso and a lame leg
this is almost like mechwarrior at times but without the innovation
the replay value gets up there since you get more powerful mechs of increasingly various designsso the fun factor of this game is pretty up there especially for ms gundam fans however as an objective gamer this a borderline coaster in the makingwe are generally great fans of mech games and have played many of them
we were psyched when gundam came out for the ps  and very disappointed when we played itif you havent watched the animated series or played other gundam games you are engaged in a great war involving a set of mechanised large robots fighting another set of almost identical large robots
they can stomp on tanks kick over buildings and engage in hand to hand energysword combat
think of gigantic samurai warriors who enjoy both blade and gunthe two sides here are the federation forces protecting earth against the zeon  an earth colony who has come back to earth to take over
all of the fighting takes place in various locations on earth which by now has had half of its population wiped out by this fightingdont worry too much about plotline here though
really what happens is you are dropped into a landscape and told to blow up every enemy unit you find
while most games give you training and guidance at the beginning this game tosses you into the fray without even a hint of what to do or how to do it
expect to get a few sad deaths before you get the hang of things
of course thats assuming you start out on the standard difficulty level  there are five difficulties here including a very easy suitable for  year oldsspeaking of five year olds the graphics really needed much more work to be up to ps standards
the mechs themselves are ok with a fair amount of detail shadowed edges reflective surfaces little details of logo and lettering and battle scarring
there is a realistic feel to how they moveon the other hand the world you tromp around in is ps level in quality if not a little worse
ive definitely seen better water animation in many ps games as well as tree and landscapesgameplay ranges from frustrating to laughable
you get stuck on invisible walls
when you slash at enemies you go into the black knight of the monty python holy grail movie where limbs fall off and the robot hobbles after you without any arms
you do get to upgrade as you progress earning more options
you can customize your suits in your hangar  but the interface is very clunky and looks almost ps in stylethey do have some nice features that show some thought  if you fire off a rocket style weapon a cloud of smoke envelops you and you have to wait a few seconds or move out of it before you can see well againi have to comment on sound because first the voice actors in combat are very silly
second the soundtrack is almost exactly a ripoff from the gladiator soundtrack
i own and love the gladiator soundtrack and its amazing how many sections are pretty much exactly the same
im surprised there isnt a copyright suit being launched herein addition we had problems with stuttering sound to the point that we had to reboot our ps and try again
luckily it went away once we did thatin general this was just not a fun game for us to play which was a real disappointment
maybe a future release for the ps will have the time spent to fix many of these issues and draw us into playing it repeatedly like we play our other mech gamesas with all the games gets boring really quickly
on a separate note be sure to read the fine print in the product descriptionmine was only the guitar which i did not realize until i noticed the seller description saying guitar onlythese are ok if you are doing easy or medium difficulty lightstandard
on hardheavy i cant get as though its annoying
you have to hit the sensors dead center or it doesnt like to register
normally with pads you can hit kinda in the vicinity and they will pick it up
not so with these ones
compounding this problem is the fact that the pads do slip
all soft pads will slip no matter what the box says
nonslip is bogus
ive seen ppl duct tape them down and maybe if you do this they will stay in place
i dont bother as i tend to move them here and there a lot and i dont want them sitting in the middle of my living room all the timetheyre cheap pads and i wasnt sure what to expect
i guess they are pretty much what i thought they would beactually a little less
im left wondering if i shouldve bought some other pads instead
maybe i will if i end up playing a lot with my friends
if you are pretty into ddr its unlikely these pads will satisfy you
if you just play recreationally and not aggressively they might be ok  ive gotten as on songs im playing now with other pads check redoctane they make good ones but they are costly and im getting much lower now frustratingif youve got a little extra cash you may want to spring for some pads with foam inserts
this helps you orient yourself so you dont start veering and it also keeps the pad somewhat in place
with this soft one you will have to readjust it after every songoftentimes i have to do it midsong or i will run into something
on a positive note these pads worked well with my pcjust plug them in by usb and they are good to go stepmania pretty much recognizes them too no drivers or all of that
however im struggling to get them to work with a usb hub they may not do thatconclusion newbies and recreational players go ahead i guess more serious or competitive players probably dont bother
biggest complaint is probably the seemingly small sensors
the rest of the negatives are mostly common to soft pads and not really unique to these ones
ddr is incredibly fun but i have to take away a star of fun since my scores arent accurately reflecting my performance
well the songs are still good at leastyes this game isnt the best of its class but it was a very hard concept to make and by this rd party developer atari that made games such as enter the matrix and so on one cant really expect an award winning game of the year franchise to follow through
this game would have been more successful had it been rated teen since the gameplay is simplistic as devil may cry and there was no need for the ultra gore
overall its an above average game that didnt do too hot in the market that was targeted for a small group of gamers
not too bad but not too great eitherbullet witch is bad
atari and cavias thirdperson action game is so bad in fact that i dont even feel like it deserves a flowery introduction
toss in a terrible game engine embarrassing graphics and dont forget to leave out all of the ai
youre bubbling up a stew of bullet witch kiddiesprotagonist alicia is busy running around killing demons after years of horrible events wipe out the vast majority of humankind
shes quiet but shes got a sharp attitude and a hot trigger finger
this is the premise of bullet witch and very little else is explained as the game progresses
alicia doesnt like demons
she wants to kill them
its that simpleunfortunately it actually isnt that simple
alicia despite being an attractive heroine controls like a grumpy old man with a crooked walker
shes got some nimble dodge moves mapped to the xbox s l trigger and these moves let her avoid everything short of exploding cars falling objects and snipers that are evidently so sharp that they can nail her midjump
in other words you wont be avoiding much as you hop around wildly and steer your cowlike character around the levelsyou also wont be shooting much the games collision detection seems random at best
i would often stand a few paces from an enemy unloading a machine guns entire magazine only to watch the enemy mow down alicia using his machine gun
lame
the collision detection rears its ugly face anytime the games walnut head enemies come around
walnut heads are floating bodies with huge pulsating brainsthey control magical barriers that alicia has to break down to continue through the levels meaning that fighting walnut heads is mandatory
walnut heads have the power of telekinesis and telepathically throw cars and other huge objects at alicia commonly killing her before shes even spotted themalicia can use her broomlike gun imagine that to kill enemies and the player can even change the gun into different forms
by finishing levels you earn skill points and can upgrade the machine gun into a shotgun sniper rifle or gatling gun
unfortunately none of the unlockable forms are as efficient as the machine gun
since there is unlimited ammo and alicia doesnt seem to die quickly there isnt much need to think while shooting
alicias spellcasting powers are terribly done using the bumpers youll scroll through different types of magic
some magic like the ancient wall ability is completely useless
ancient walls completely obstruct your view and break down quickly
natural set pieces like blownup cars and corners provide much better cover
offensive spells like meteor storms and lightning bolts are powerful but use most of your magic points and therefore cant be utilized often enough to be considered helpful
annoyingly animations are loaded up as alicia conjures up her destructive powers that prevent her from avoiding any attacks whatsoever and even freeze her in place for seconds after casting
even worse you cant hotkey any of the magic spells to the otherwise unused directional padwhats the deal with thatartificial intelligence is completely missing from this product
in the second level you encounter a few buildingsized buffoons with huge machine guns theyre designed to look absolutely monumental and terrifying but are actually gentile giants
each of them that i encountered in that level actually stopped walking toward me stopped shooting and calmly allowed me to shoot their pulsating hearts until they exploded and fell to the ground
i thought the first giant might be a fluke but indeed the next ones just stopped their terrorinducing rage when they laid eyes on alicia
the basic grunts are so incredibly stupid that theyll actually walk away from you and into walls after being shot
still theyve got hearttheyre so hellbent on killing innocent humans that theyll ignore alicia filling their backside with lead and lightning bolts
ive seen daddy longlegs missing all eight long legs put up more of a struggle than these brainless doltsbullet witch is among the ugliest of the xbox s library
as i ran through the postapocalyptic settings i couldnt help but think of majescos xbox sleeper phantom dustbut even that bargain xbox title looked better and ran better than this xbox  one
there are blurry and undetailed textures everywhere little to no particle effects as a result of shooting the ground walls or glasshell the only visuallypleasant sights are the games menus and the trails of smoke that accompany smoldering exploded and destroyed cars on their trip back to the ground
remember those giants i was just going on about
after completing that level you see a newspaper clipping with a subheadline that reads whos going to remove these giant corpses from the streets
no one silly
the bodies disappear when you move away from them
other objects do the opposite appearing as alicia approaches their vicinity
clipping must be one of alicias witchcraft powers because she can walk through what appear to be solid chairs tables fire hydrants cratesthe list goes onall of the above problems are silhouetted by the fact that bullet witch is about six hours long
there are six levels each takes about an hour to complete
doing so earns you some xbox  achievements but there is no way that even the most addicted achievement freak should spend  on a video game that offers six levels
there are currently plans to release more content via xbox live but this is a  product trespassing in a  boxif bullet witch had a consistent physics engine artificial intelligence of any kind and even a trace of collision detection it might be an average shooter
as it iswell in the first sentence of this review i said bullet witch is bad
i just repeated it and it doesnt need to be said againthere are so many things that are frustrating with this game that i dont even know where to start
so here it goes
the camera argh
half the time you cant see what your fighting because your character is in the way or one of the lame ai characters desides to plant his butt right in your view
speaking if ai why is it that they seem to shoot allot but kill nothing
i cant tell you how many times i got killed from someone from behind while the stupid ai just watchedthe skills system that allows you to upgrade your magic and weapon would be good if the game lasted more than four hours and you had more opportunity to upgrade
you get awarded points at the end of each level and if you sucked good luck upgrading anything
for example i had to play the game through twice just to get all four gun modes and then when you finally are able to level up your gunwitchcraft theres no difference
ive maxed out my machine gun and its no different than it was when i started lots of noise and  shots just to kill one enemy
argh
what were the developers thinkingthe levels are long and tedious with allot of kill this thing to unlock that gate
another funny note is that you meet the final boss right off and youre told that you cant fight him right now because you lack the skills however when you finally do fight him youre character is no different than when you started
what
i know you dont get it but if you buy this game you will anyway i bought this title because theres a survival horror thing going here on which i love however is the game worth it
trust me rent it firstbullet witch gets  stars from me because there are some really cool moments like battling a demon at  feet while trying not to fall off the jet
the great magic that you get is pretty cool to watch in action but the magic regeneration will have you once again wondering wtflets face it everytime a videogame incorporates a female leading character the game turn into ruinsexamples
red ninja suckednightshade sucked tomb raider  sucks aeon flux suckslike that there are manybulletwitch is no exemption she sucks
shes a gungrave devil may cry wanna be thats all she isthe game is pretty boring feels just like gungrave its for sure a gungrave ripoffbut then again atari does not make great games eitherthis game is a rental at mostits not worth your buy a real mens game buy god of war  insteadthe premise of this game is that the world has basically ended due to a string of tragedies like earthquakes wars etc
oh
and then all of the sudden zombies demons pop up
enter a gothic looking babe toting a biggerthansheis broomstick shaped machine gun who is for some reason going to shoot her way through the hordes of zombie soldiers to save us all
sweet rightas far as i am concerned for a video game  thats actually a fine premise
on top of that the design on the main character is pretty nifty
in fact it was nifty enough for me to pick this up out of the bargain bin and take it homethats when i played the game and instantly regretted the  i had just lost
truth is there is no way the developers looked at the final product and went yes
this is exactly what we envisioned
its perfect and without flaw
now the game is technically playable
but realistically it is so broken that its just not worth your time andor moneythe biggest issue is not the halfwaythere stage layouts which are chock full o pointless and distant dead ends the terrible dialogue and the well we tried ps worthy graphics
its the fact that the enemy ai is literally retarded
enemies walk into walls run around in circles fire sporadically sometimes notice you while youre a mile a way and cant see them and sometimes are blissfully unaware that you are right in front of them
if you get a car thrown at you you have a  chance that it will kill you instantly or not hurt you at all regardless of whether it actually hits you or not
most of your time spent playing this game will have you wondering what the hell is going on
not to worry
the game doesnt know eithersure theres nfity gun upgrades and some somewhat useful magic that is a huge pain to use which helps the game be fun for like  minutes or until you realize that its not going to get any betterits sort of a shame because you can definitely see a really cool game that just needed a little bit of extra attention to live up to its potential
sadly its just not there dooming this game to a life in the bargain bin
which is where it should staythere are a lot of things i could say about this game but what it boils down to is this rent it firstfor the sake of time and clarity im going to mention whats bad and leave it up to you to find whats good  if there is any that is camera angle
ever wish you could see the world through a cats eyes
now you can as the camera is located mid south on the screen and gives a disassociated feeling by placing it about where the eyes of a small following animal would be viewing from aiming
closely tied in with  when you aim you can barely see the area
since this is hard to explain ill say this take your favorite shooter aim at a ceiling look directly out wyour eyes and you will see how shootingaiming in bullet witch looks shooting
your bullets have very low damage its hard to lockon to a target because of how the aiming is and generally gives a nbish feel
think spongebob with a gun  thats how it feels
this game is a shooter like jail is a hotel  it takes more than a bed to justify the label melee
one move with two parts  very exciting
they made no attempt to add any color here and it basically shows the lack of quality and care given to the game spells
these are not traditional projectiles as far as ive seen anyway
they rain from the sky in a two part process which demonstrates further lack of care
during the second phase the aiming you are completely vulnerable to attacks while you fiddle with the target and if your enemy even half deserves the attack youre preparing you will probably be dead before it pulls
dont worry if you missed reloading from a checkpoint is only a few clicks awayto sum the game up a bit better ill say this a good game gives you a character you can relate to with a story worth hearing and a character whose controls permit mastery  so what is this game
the opposite
within  five minutes of loading this game you will know all you need to as to whether you will like or dislike itas far as being a witch im not sure having a few magic spells constitutes a trait worth mentioning
you could have said she was a genetically enhanced gerbil with plastic surgery and it wouldnt have mattered
for effect i assume they gave you a gun which looks like a broom and thus solidify her position as a witchif you like numbers just examine the steep price drop bullet witch has experienced in contrast to games such as gears of war oblivion etc  might save you a few bucksgood lucki bought bullet witch back in the fall of   i fully cleared the game for all achievements and then put it away as soon as possible
i wanted to like this game but ended up only liking the main character
it seems they poured most of their budget into her creation and rushed everything else
it seems like they originally intended to create a different game
i say this because the levels are not always linear yet often you will reach a dead end that has nothing of interest nothing to kill nothing to pick up just nothing
the graphics are subpar the environments are not detailed and the enemies uninspired
also the enemies are recycled over and over
i remember mostly relying on  gun to beat the game on all difficulties
basically the end product was a good start a rough draft nothing moretoo bad you cant use curse words on amazon because there would be a load right now
this game is filled with good intentions and some nice ideas but just not thought out as well as it should have
mowing down demon soliers in a suburban neighborhood should be alot funner than this
and while the magic effects are nice the overall feel of this game is very mediocre the movements are awkward and while some of the graphics are nice and sharp the overall bland enviornments will just have you shaking your head
sure all the explosions look purty but dont they all on next gen
this could have a been a really fun guilty pleasure with a little more effort behind it but instead its just very hohum
another year in development could have maybe turned this around
butjust play bloodrayne  againgreat graphics engine but it was poorly put to use
levels are about as linear as in any game we have played in the last  years
instead of being inventive you need to guess what the level designer wanted you to do
basically go straight ahead picking off the enemies  at a time is a predictable manner
when you need to use the gravity you will know as there is an obvious object put right in front of yougraphics and monsters look really great
keyboard controls are greatso much potential so much wasted
had to play only one session a week as it becomes extremely boring
inside levels look a lot alike
you will get tired of running down the corridor finding the one door of  that opens shoot the predictable monster open the next door loop around above where you were and finally out a door near where you started
even the outdoor scenes have boulders and cliffs placed right along the path that the level designer dictated you should go
no attacking from a cliff no kamikaze jumps into the enemy no fununeventful ending
the whole last  of the game is a waste of great graphics and playability is poor  starsteam updates nearly every time you start the game delaying your session by a minute or two even if you arent playing online
the game doesnt even start loading for  seconds even if there isnt an update
just dumbgreat game engine terrible game implementationi have to admit i am utterly shocked and confounded by all of the positive reviews this game has gotten
it is one of the most highlyrated games on gamespots and igns websites as well as many other places
its called one of the best games ever made and possibly the best fps ever made
but im afraid i have to vehemently disagree with that opinionbefore i talk about the game itself let me just say this about the steam engine i dont like the idea of it at all but having said that installing the game and setting up an account was extremely easy and painless
it was just a normal installation as far as im concerned
there was nothing complicated about it
those who had problems either had a different version or made some mistakes or maybe had something like aol that was perhaps incompatible
i dont know but dont let the whole steam controversy deter you from trying the gamenow for the game itself
first off let me name the good things about this game excellent graphics excellent voice acting nice level variation with vehicles mixed in and the story develops in an interesting way rather than cutscenes the characters walk around and talk with you in the actual game worldhaving said that i simply despised every minute that i played this game
in a way i almost cant describe why i had such a strong negative reaction to what i was really hoping and expecting to be a great game
but some of the definite things i can say are thesethere are absolutely too many enemies
right from the beginning which is even worse since you have fewer weapons you are constantly bombarded by enemies all around you
you might think everything is clear but suddenly there are two or three guys way ahead of you so far ahead that you can barely see them but they are pretty good at seeing and shooting you
on top of this there are guys above you on elevated areas which are difficult to find so you are always wondering whats shooting at you and finally theyll appear behind you as well even though youve already cleared the area behind you
and all of this happens at the same time
im all for an actionpacked shoot em up this is an fps after all but this is just too much
it was so overwhelming and right from the start that i was frustrated nearly every minute that i walked around in this game
i was constantly under fire and taking damage and there was little i could do about it but try to shoot back  that is whenever i could finally find them allon top of this throw a few helicopters and spaceships flying above you constantly shooting you and dropping bombs on you and for quite a while there is nothing you can do about it but take it
its difficult to find a place to hide since there is so much going on so youre pretty much at the mercy of a million things at onceadd to this the most annoying enemy i have ever seen in any game ive ever played that little creature with four legs that jumps at you
these things are everywhere and they are extremely quick and difficult to target
until you get a more powerful weapon they take a few shots to kill but getting in more than one or two shots before they move again and lunge at you is difficult
i wouldnt mind so much if they only existed in one part of the game but they are everywhere and they are unbelievably maddening to deal withim also not a big fan of driving vehicles in general and i didnt really like the controls of the vehicles in this game
it didnt feel very precise to me and often i would have to backtrack or slow down and figure out where to go
it didnt feel like it played out as quickly and as smoothly as it should haveas far as the story goes there isnt much of one
the way the story unfolds is interesting as i mentioned above but its unfortunate that not too much is unfolding
for the first part of the game youre just told to move from one area to another
finally a couple of scientists are kidnapped and you have to go rescue them but i never felt like i was actually in this game at all
of course getting immersed in a game that is constantly aggrevating you is difficult to doi should also add just to emphasize that my reaction to this game was so strong and so visceral that this is the only game ive ever played where ive actually slammed my hands down on my desk or thrown them up in the air and shouted profanity and cries of frustration at the screen
more than once i actually shouted i hate this game
i think it takes a lot to actually elicit that kind of involuntary reponse but this game excelled at bringing it out of me
i truly hated every minute that i played itnow given that its gotten such great reviews and that my hatred of it is almost too emotional to be valid for anyone else i would encourage people to still try it
certainly any game that receives near perfect scores should be experienced for yourself
perhaps youll find it much less frustrating than i didthe game i bought didnt work at all but when i bought a new one it was a fun game
so the game is good but i had to buy it twice casue this one didnt work at all buy it from somewhere elseim not sure how this game won game of the year but its no where near in my opinion
first off steam
its insufferable
to play a single player game i must run something that basically takes over my computer and inundates me with advertising for valves new games
silly and slow
once you are actually playing its fine but getting there takes  minutes or more
just to exit takes more than a minute
steam lingers and is slow to release your computer from its clutchesthe game itself runs well
the engine runs smooth even with my semiold setup
the levels get tedious quickly
most of the game is spent running at breakneck speed trying to avoid enemies galore
on occasion youll puzzle out of few contrived ways to get over a wall or through a barrier
the levels were fine  years ago in half life  but im sorry to say weve seen it all before by nowive been playing games since the first computer came out
weve come a long way from wolfenstein d but you wouldnt know it playing this game
someone else put it very well that the levels are very linear
the gta series are certainly not for kids but the structure of the game makes it  times more fun than this
im sad that i uninstalled far cry to put this on because its an inferior game
level wisethere are lots of better ways to spend your time and money these days
this game is got by on its reputation from half life i will never buy a valve product ever again
to play this game you have to let steam take over your computer
this is a singleplayer game also
and i got to play it twice in a week only because steam was having problems with logins
never againthe game itself is moderately fun but as other review mentioned the graphics are about on par with a playstation  the game is odd in that instead of winning money for races you earn random parts and upgrades for your car
which is ok except that you only get new stuff the first time you win a race so if you are stuck and have gotten st place on all the races you can  win there isnt any way to move forward in the game besides trying over and over and over again
also i ended up using crappier cars for the majority of the game because having a faster car just makes the race much more difficult because all the opponents will also have faster carsthe wheel that comes with the game is almost the same black wheel that is sold independently i like it a lot and would suggest it for anyone who plans on playing racing gamesif you are just buying this for the wheel dont
just buy the wheel it self
the only other racing game ive played for the wii so far is excite truck but that game was way more fun and the graphics looked much betterdude what the crap i purchased this game thinking it was going to have good graphics and it would be fun i was wrong on both
its fun for the first few levels but gets really old
ive havent tried multiplayer wich is why it sucks so bad
unless you have wifi dont get this game ouchgraphics are ok and all psp games are short so im not sure why so many here complain about that
with this game when an enemy comes into view and you begin to exchange fire the game actually freezes up and three seconds later when it begins to move again youre like oh i guess i killed the guy
this happens all the time
very annoying and not something ive seen in any other game ive ever palyed socom  killzone  syphon filterbest buy has this game for 
thats the only reason i was generous with  starsfallout and fallout  are awesome
fallout tactics is also a good game
but how can a company justify releasing decade old games without including the updated patches
that is just completely unacceptable especially when not only have these patches been out for years but the bugs left in the games are very substantial
patheticive been a fan of these games since the first one  secrets can kill  came out
ive played them allim not at all sure whats happened to the games though
while the graphics have steadily improved the puzzles plot and gameplay have really gone downhillthe first game secrets can kill had pretty horrific graphics but the story was compelling and there were some fabulous puzzles in itthings really picked up with the second game stay tuned for danger
better graphics and a very interesting story very cool puzzles great ploti can absolutely recommend games  stay tuned for danger  message in a haunted mansion  treasure in the royal tower  the final scene  secret of the scarlet hand  ghost dogs of moon lake  danger on deception island and  secret of shadow ranchthese games are similar in length and have interesting puzzles
lots of areas where you can snoop around  which i really enjoygame  the haunted carousel is interesting and has wonderful graphics but is awfully shorti did not at all enjoy  curse of blackmoor manor as i found it way too difficult
i also cannot really recommend  secret of the old clock
it was too short and repetitivei did somewhat enjoy  last train to blue moon canyon and  danger by design but they were nowhere near the quality of the earlier games in terms of plot or puzzlesand now we have   outstanding graphics but way too short
the amount of repetition of puzzles in order to advance drove me completely crazy
i dont mind nancy running about doing errands to help people for that i thought games  and  had it perfectly balanced
but i like each task to be different and interesting
not mindnumbingly repetitive and boringthis seems to be a factor of the more recent games  delivering telegrams in game  painting pictures in game  and now finding seashells and making necklaces in this gamei miss looking for clues
putting together evidence for a purpose
i miss puzzles that actually are woven into the fabric of the plot and are there to advance the game
it seems like the repetition now might be so that it can be said that this game took x number of hours to completei also miss learning useful thingsin  i learned about american sign languagein  i learned about chinese symbols and the san francisco earthquakein  i learned about latitude and longitude and how a sextant worksin  i learned so much about the maya and how to work a ham radioin  i learned about roman numerals and prohibitionin  i learned how to make invisible writingin  i learned how to work a ham radio and about pacific northwest sea animalsafter that well i didnt really learn very much of anything useful in any of the later gamesif youve never played a nancy drew game please please please do yourself a favor and start with one of the earlier games although probably not the very first one  the graphics arent as good and switching discs can be highly annoying
but give    a try you wont be disappointedoh please her interactive please go back to the way they used to be structured
id gladly sacrifice some of the improved graphics if it meant regaining some plot cohesion or integrated interesting puzzleswhile i admit i like what they were trying to do with this game they really came up short
in essence there are two mysteriesand somehow they still managed to make it one of their shortest games
in the game you need to get nancy and the hardy boys to the ending though the story on the hardy boys side is extremely lacking
nancys is a bit better but they really could have fleshed it out morebut what im here to discuss is the ending
in a game this short the best move they could have made would have been to give it really strong ending
instead its a graphic nightmare and i wont usually discuss the graphics of the games but this ending is ugly very very ugly
it also makes no logical sense
if you play through to the end youll see what i mean
it also breaks the first person view which is a huge nono in my books
part of the catch of these games is that you are nancy drew
you
are
nancy drew
you are not some omnipotent person controlling her from above
you are herthe first person point of view can be broken at times for understandable reasons such as with driving in a couple of their games or in the cemetery in crystal skull its massive i would have hated to have had to navigate it in first person and i cant imagine how hard it would have been to do graphics for it that would have eaten up the whole game
however this ending is inexcusable
the puzzle is completely illogical and they should have opted instead for a traditional capture the villain or escape the volcano style in first person
plus when you do beat the final puzzle it wouldnt logically segue into the ending
beating that puzzle should have had no affect on the villains mindset and decisions because you didnt do anything to change their mind
you didnt even try to capture them
it was just a complete mess
sorry for the redundancies but after the companys last game  tomb of the lost queen at this point in time  i really think this company needs to hear that complaint because they just dont seem to get iti have played every nancy drew game that has come out and i have never been this disappointed
this was too short and you didnt even know what the people had done who were arrested in the end
the story line was good
seems like it should have really went somewhere but no it didnt
the puzzles were too simple and believe you me i have the most trouble with puzzles
very disappointed in her interactive
dont rush it next timeits better to wait for a great one than to get it fast and beat it too fastexcept for saw and fin i own and have played all of the nancy drew pc games and i know that it takes a combination of many different things in order to make a great mystery game
while most of the games are missing one of the factors that keep it from being perfect or even better the creature of kapu cave has too many of these factors missing which ends up making the ending product feel bare and blandstory 
this story is one of the most unrealistic actually as nancy goes to hawaii to be a research assistant to dr quigley kim
the actual creature of kapu cave is barely mentioned and also completely did not fit the plot at all
its never even clear who or what the creature is or wasgraphicssetting 
graphics were getting better with this game especially with the characters
theyre movements and mannerisms continue to look less robotic
the setting was the decent hawaii shore and a big fancy research center along with a messy camp and was definitely not the lowest point of the gamecharacters 
you dont get to meet a whole lot of people
theres dr kim who sounds very nasal and like someone very humorous herself hint the nanny a father and daughter beach bum team and a rude and uptight research center manager
they defnitely have personalities although they are very irritating at timespuzzles 
there really arent that many puzzles as there are chores
the puzzles themselves were pretty straightforward and simple and werent a highlight for sureexploration 
theres virtually no snooping in this game and you get to explore a boring research center a messy camp a volcano and a two foot stretch of beach shore
the term explore is used loosely in that sentenceactivities 
you can make shaved ice play an arcade game named wiki tiki and collect shells
all get old within secondsending 
definitely the dumbest ending of the first  games and maybe of the whole series
it was the first ending up to this point in the series that didnt leave me with a gasp a goosebump or even a surprisetotal averaged  out of  rounded tohonestly even a diehard herinteractive fan like i am cant really find anything positive about this game and this game possibly doesnt even deserve a spot on a nancy drew fans shelfboth this game and danger by design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games shadow ranch the last train to blue moon canyon secret of the old clock etc
the game was short and i thought the tasks were a bit dull
i also found it somewhat confusing switching between nancy drew and the hardy boys
hopefully her interactive will produce something better next time because these games really are addictive even for adultslongtime nancy drew player here
this game was extremely dull and one of my least favorites overall
you spend the game playing two almost separate mysteries
you can play as frank and joe hardy who are at a beach and nancy drew who is in the jungle
you switch between characters by calling each other on the phone
this is actually fun and not the bad partthe bad part is that you really dont do much sluething
when you play as the hardy boys youre gathering seashells on the beach to make necklaces to exchange for prizes
you have to keep going and coming back to the beach to find all the right shells
you can talk to two people at the beach
nancy on the other hand can seemingly only talk to the researcher shes with and spends most of her time doing chores for her in the very limited amount of jungle you can explorenone of it seems important and the whole game just feels dull
when i got to the end which didnt take that long i was just happy that it was over with
i usually love to replay nancy drew games but this along with secret of the scarlet hand and randsom of the seven ships is probably going to be one of the ones i dont ever play againid reccomend the newest game shadow at the waters edge or if youre set on the beach theme the older danger on deception island insteadive played every one of her interactives nancy drew games and except for the last two or three loved all of them
her interactive offers preteen girls the chance to use brainpower not firepower and to pick up various educational tidbits that tie into the games
the graphics and voicework have steadily improved from the very first nancy drew game secrets can kill but the last three games last train to blue moon canyon danger by design and creature of kapu cave have seen some backsliding in tired puzzles monotonous findtheobject and performthetasktogettheneededobject and the lack of suspense that made games like ghost dogs of moon lake and message in a haunted mansion greatcreature of kapu cave finds nancy on an assignment in hawaii land of swaying palm trees hula dancers and pristine beachesbut youll have to read travel brochures if you want to see any of those things
the beach in the game is pitifully small and doesnt allow for exploration beyond collecting seashellsand most of the time you end up going back and forth to the beach to collect the same shell
nancy is working as an intern for quigley kim an aspiring entomologist
nancy also investigates a mysterious genius with serious angermanagement issues
but where is the mystery
the intrigue
the im being followed by something creepy momentsone nice feature is the ability to switch between nancy and the hardy boys by calling each other on your cell phone
navigation is done via gps
nice concept but the animation quickly grew repetitive every time i needed to select another locationmost of your time is spent in the jungle collecting frass
what is frass
to put it delicatelybug poop
yes nancy spends a frustrating amount of time collecting and analyzing bug poop
frank and joe hardy are undercover checking up on big island mike and pua mapu
mike runs big island mikes excursions a sort of barter economy where you catch fish and make seashell necklaces to earn big island bucks which can then be traded in for souvenirs fishing bait and necklace supplies
pua is an upandcoming surf champ
other than that there is a noticeable lack of secondary characters and potential suspectsthe puzzles are the games major weak point
much of the game at least half feels like repetitive filler making necklaces collecting shells to make more necklaces playing the annoying arcade game to win stuff to make more necklaces and sitting around trying to catch fish
there were no fun puzzles spending hours sorting through insect parts and bug poop does not count
there is also an optional arcade game wiki tiki which has the most annoying song ever heard in a video game
the game is based on paper rock scissors and is purely based on what the computer draws
prizes include sharks teeth which can be used in more expensive necklacesalso there are very few locations to explore and very restricted movement within those locations
the beach for example is about four or five clicks long
youre blocked from continuing down the beach by a fallen tree
this is hawaii so more beach to explore would have been nice
the jungle screens all looked the same
similarly kapu cave offered pretty scenery but little to explore or interact withoverall the game feltempty
the amount of mindnumbing repetitive filler puzzles added nothing to the overall experience except frustration
the ending held no hint of mystery or a rewarding payoff
i can only hope that the next nancy drew title is a return to her interactives glory daysthe good voice acting graphics musicthe bad length very short weak puzzles including at least one known bug weak story noticeable lack of characters to investigate limited locations and restricted freedom of movement no sense of mystery or suspense two words frass jarsi found this game really ineteresting in the fact that you go to play both nany and the hardy boys with a phone call you trade places and play as the other other then that the game like many of the other recent ones have fallen short  seems like each game has slowly gotten short and ended more abruptly honestly i think they have to start putting more thought into these games not just trying to get them out as fast possible the ideas they have are good  but they have exacuted them very well lately  hoping the new game does not fall short like the resti was very disappointed with this game
i played all of the nd mystery games and im a big fan
this was a short game and not interesting
nancy drews assignment was looking through bug waste and counting and weighting whatever she found
the only thing i liked was playing as hardy boys when nancy drew called them on the phonemy sister and i have watched every possible movieshow and read every piece on this showwe have all the games
however they just arent as funeasy to play on the ds
much better on other systemsone of my all time favorites but completely unplayable on my ps
it hangs i mean forever at specific boards
disc completely new and untouchedanother question is why is there no support for the bluray for dragons lair  space ace on digital leisures siteis it because they knew there are way too many glitchesi have to say the problems people state about playing it on their ps are valid
but it seems to be a hit and miss problem
i played this on my fathers ps and it had that problem of hitting a particular scene and then freezing
i brought it home and played it on my own ps and it worked smoothly with not so much as a long pause between loading chapters
but hit and miss notwithstanding the fact that this glitch appears on any of the pss which by all rights should be playing it better than any stand alone player with all its updating abilities necessarily causes me to drop the star ratingthe other thing is that whether you play it on arcade or home mode it skips randomly around the scenes every time you die
granted once youve gone through all of them once it will play the ones you died on in order until you pass them
but just the fact that it has the randomness no matter what setting you put it on to begin with just ruins the flow of the game and makes it really irksome until you get to the point where youre actually playing the gamethat said once you get around to playing the game proper and once you find a system that it works well on this is a pretty fun game
i never got a chance to play it in the arcades back in the day
but being able to play it now shows how innovative this was at the time
instead of controlling digital sprites you not so much as control as influence fully animated cartoon characters
while the guessing and timing of when to press what button when can get aggravating at times its also rewarding when you finally figure it outalso the graphics are amazing
theres a little featurette that compares the graphics of several versions including the laserdisc and dvd versions
this is clearly the most polished this game has ever beenso to break it all down great game awesome graphics great transferwhen it works
thats the biggest strike
it simply doesnt work dependably
you may have a ps or other blu ray player that it works fine on
you might get it and find that its glitchy at best
given that kind of hit and miss chance of whether or not it will work i simply cant recommend this productthis was original equipment
worked great and got timely and at a fair priceit worked great for a little while and then issues started popping up until it stopped connecting to any of our wiimotes
ive been through  nunchuks and only the one that came with the consul has worked for more than a couple months
ive tried generic and nintendo brandive never liked the nunchukbut ill usually buy it to accompany another wii remote controller just in case a buddy wants to use itthe controller works fine and does what it needs to do
its mostly the designimplementation i have a problem withi had problems with this a week or three after i started using it
primarily in how it attached to the wii remote
nintendo was really a bonehead for not making the wiinunchuk attachment more solid
something that physically locked onto the bottom of the wii remote would have been nice to keep the nunchuk firmly in placesadly while playing skyward sword the nunchuks connection started to lose integrity
i ended up dropping this one for an official wii nunchukand to make it more stable i now have a stretchy hair band like women use to make a ponytail wrapped twice around the base of my wii remote plus with the nunchuk wire snugly in place against the side of the wr
this allows the nunchuk and wr to move without the bottom connection to wiggle even a little biti have since had no problems at allyou can buy the same points instantly on wii shop channel
 us dollars points rule of thumb is to move the decimal point over  spaces and add a  dollar sign so  points us dollars points us dollarswhy do i have this controller that will not work on nintendo gamecube games that i want to play on my wii
the only benefit this offers is that it plugs into your wiimote and then becomes semiwireless still killing your batteries
do yourself a favor and spend the same  on a wireless gamecube controller
you can still play the virtual console games plus the gamecube discs and not have a remote connected  feet awaythis controler was not exactly good to me
i didnt wait long for it to get here
i was looking forward to using it for resident evil  but now as i use it i just cant help but get annoyed even using itif you started playing re with the normal remote then stick to it far better than thisthis has to be one of the most uncomfortable controllers made
sadly its required to play lots of old classic games
make sure to get the grip addon thing i think nyko makes it it makes this controller at least bearablewell i bought a game geometry wars that wasnt compatible with the gamecube controller and i went out and bought this
it might be okay for kids but it is too small for me and the shape is bad for holding on to it
gamecube controllers might have been a little small but they have a good grip
after using this i decided to go back to using the regular wii controller and nunchuck
should have come with a removable modern gripi wont go into detail about what i like that is covered in detail in other reviewsill focus on the one thing that ruined the game for us the megastrike
youre playing along and really getting into the flow of the game when someone uses megastrike
the action stops
the game goes through the same animation cutscene and obnoxious heavy metal riff before getting to the lousy minigame of being a goalie and trying to stop  to  soccer shots
and it takes so looooong to get past this
everysingletime
and you cant shut off the feature so you have to be careful not to hit the button combo that causes a megastrike
very hard to do
in the end everyone would just groan when it came up and we finally just put it in its box and never played againwe love maria golf and mario kart and the other wonderful titles but they really blew it on strikers with the megastrike
we sold our strikers on amazon for half what we paid for it and were glad to do itthis case for the nintendo wii has plenty of space but completely fails in key areas
i would have given this case  star but i gave a star for the fact there is plenty of space for accessoriesprosplenty of room to store the wii accessories and  gamesyou could play the wii straight from the case without removing it due to opening on the bottom of the casesee consconsall your accessories are clumped together in a giant comparment so you have a giant mess
it would be nice if they had individual sections for the accessories so they arent banging around on each otherthe platform where the wii sits on has no support in the middle and there is some bend in the platform once you put the wii in the case
i can see this completly bending
they need something in the middle of the platform which would then also help for organization of your componentszipping and unzipping the bag is a painplaying from the case is kinda pointless because all you save is the fact that you dont have to remove the wii
since all your accessories are clumped together you have to remove everything else anywaysodin sphere has garnered a lot of acclaim
indeed its graphical design has made for a unique game as the colorful d images come to life like no other i or anyone else judging by the stellar reviews have ever seen
the game has a deep storyunfortunately its not very fun to play
moreover it is incredibly difficult
now difficulty isnt a bad thing in a game but this one really takes the cake in that regard
some bosses are absolutely murderous forcing the player to power up incessantly both to increase strength as well as garner funds for powerful items
moreover running back and forth on a d plain slashing at enemies attacking in the air and on the ground isnt exactly an original ideai dont want to spoil any of the story as it was strong and often helped an otherwise poor offering
but all in all i would wait for this game to hit the twenty dollar bin
at fifty bucks it just doesnt deliverwhile i give this game points for the absolutely beautiful and unique graphics i just cant bear to slug my way through the entire gamelets take a moment to talk about the games most distinguished merit graphics
now just because the graphics are my favourite part of this game doesnt mean that you should expect the most advanced visuals
what is great about what you will see is that you probably havent seen anything quite like itsure youve played sidescrollers and seen japanesestyle cartoon characters but screenshots just dont tell the whole story here
the characters have a motion that somehow allows a d cartoon character to come alive
beyond that there is just an enormous amount of detail poured into the environments that you just dont see in other d realmsthat said there are just a number of flaws that bring this wouldbe giant to its knees
ill only focus on the most important gameplay
be prepared to be frustrated
when you first start out you will be puzzled by seemingly unresponsive button presses
as you play you will learn that presses just dont register while the character is carrying out the current action
what this amounts to is slowly and carefully timing your buttons with the animations which is incredibly counter intuitive and clumsy especially when you have five to ten bad guys bumrushing you at high speed
your natural tendency is to mash away which will ultimately result in your demisein the end this game may be worth the bargain price but only as a whimsical and short diversion for those dry spells between major new releasessummarybeautiful art meets clumsy controlsprosabsolutely wonderful art and animationsunique concept of combining action and rpg elements albeit not masterfully executedconsfrustratingly clumsy controlsrepetitive level designi was looking forward to this game due to the great reviews
so i was a bit disappointed with the game
the graphics are not as good as they are in the advertising
i feel the game is very repetitive and the story is really shallownot a bad game for  but i dont get all the  star reviewsthis was one game i was looking forward to playing before trading in my ps for a ps
at least i got to try it outfive characters take part in an interwoven tale often one character will briefly appear as an opponent for a different one
each role seems at least reasonably compelling as far as the story itself although why some of the background actions like the opening war are not always clearly or believably explainedstory odin sphere has been widely praised for its beautiful d graphics
yes a lot of work has been done including crouching and looking up but that doesnt save it from looking the same a lot of the time
there is a great deal of repetition in the moves enemies and areas that draws down what should have been a pretty gamegraphics sound effects and magic sound appropriate and you can choose either english or japanese dub from the start and change that at will from the ingame options menu
however you cant independently alter voicing or effects
limited options pulled this score down for mesound some of the music is pretty but the majority of it is the barely there background type
when i have game music i like to notice that there is music rather than it being usually indistinguishable from silence
no options for volume leveling pulls down the score a littlemusic despite there being minute differences between the characters some characters take longer to use items and eat food and having nominally different weapons spears and swords
however the areas are the same circles and actual game play consists of the exact same swing swing pause for action gauge to refill repeat that got tiring before i finished the first character
its also extremely easy to be interrupted from attacking or using items  if a boss hits you while youre trying to eat a bun you drop the item and lose more health and typically are stunned on top of that
frustrating not fun
the fact that characters share maps and youll be running around the exact same areas many times does not helpgameplay you can replay cutscenes but as repetitious as the game is you likely wont even want to play the other characters much less come back to replay the rather linear greater playreplay it looks nice and it has both dubs to serve your preferences but the sound and music seemed lackluster and the frustrating boringly repetitive gameplay was a quick and consistent disappointment
rent before you consider buyingoverall i want to like this game but where it fails however is the controls which are very unresponsive often ill move the controller to do some move or another and absolutely nothing happens
this is a problem for example when trying to do a jump dash over a large gapthe problem of unresponsive controls has cropped up in several wii games that ive played so its not just this game that suffers but several and i know its not just my controller because ive tried others
there are games out there that make a good use of the controller and work for the most part properly but i suspect that its just really hard to make games work right with motion controlsthe controls for this game are extremely hard to get used to
they are very touchy and unintuitive
also you can pretty much only go forward
if you miss something you have to walk backwards to get to it
i was hoping that i would be allowed to make sonic move in all directions but moving from side to side takes forever and he only side steps he doesnt turn and walk to the side
on the plus side the graphics in this game are the best i have seen for the wii so far
the levels look gorgeous
its a shame i cant explore themthe party mode is horrible too
the games move extremely slow and the controls are also terrible and unintuitive
id say that party mode kills the party and just ends up making people frustrated especially people who dont play wii that often and dont understand the wii remote quirksoverall this game is a waste of 
its a fun amusement for about half an hour but eventually the games shortcomings become so painfully obvious that i cant play it any longerdont buy this game
you arent missing muchwhen you first buy this game your most likely gonna say to yourself wow this game is great why does everyone hate it so much
youll say that now but play it for a little while longer before you be quick on judgment
the graphics are very good for a wii title and it had a great idea the problem is the controls do not work with you when you need them to at times they seem automatic and most of the time to forceful it gets anoying after awhile
the music while can be good if you like heavy rock just didnt suit this title
another problem was the way the storytheme took on approach for a sonic title
sure its creative but its pretty lackluster and doesnt fit for a game like this
overall this game is pretty terrible i dont recommend buying it but maybe a  day rental wont kill youmy how the mighty have fallen
what have they done to sonic the hedgehog
i bought this game under the impression that it would be a fun divergence from the traditional sonic game
i was wrongthe basic concept is simple sonic moves forward on a preset course through each level
holding the wiimote horizontally you control his turning jumping and slowing down
apparently you can even go backwards
but like many things it may sound fine on paper but the final product is a failurethe controls are terrible
they dont respond well at all
many times while trying to reverse by leaning the controller back sonic would actually move forward faster or even jump
attempts to use the homing attack often received the same treatment
this makes for a very frustrating experience
its a waste of time reversing step by agonizing step to attempt to get something you missed on the way through the course as this ruins your final time making each course one you will more than likely repeat
and it wont be any fun the next time you play it eithersteer clear of this game
the slow pace less than interesting story and horrible control system makes this game everything a sonic game shouldnt be
its nothing like any sonic game youve ever played and thats not a good thing
lets just pray sega never releases another game like this againthis game is of bad quality not horrible but bad
bad enough to not be worth a rent too
its no fun to play the graphics are mediocre the sound is almsot bad enough to mute and its not much worth replaying
this game is boring to play all you do is run through boring stages with boring objectives fighting boring enemiespresentation graphics sound terrible voice acting and poor quality musicgameplay replay value overall i have been a longtime sonic fan for years ever since i started playing sonic the hedgehog  as a kid
you could probably imagine my disappointment when i heard how much of a trainwreck sonic  was
ever since then ive witnessed the downfall of sonic the hedgehog
this is one of those games that really needs a redoprosthe secret rings has great graphicssonic looks so realistic you could probably imagine him popping out of your tvthe party games are pretty fun when you get a few people to play with you but i wouldnt recommend playing alonetheyre called party gamesit seems like a lot has been focused on the music
yeah the musics good and i like the seven rings in hand song but it just doesnt seem like our spiky blue hedgehog
other than that its goodconssonic games do not need more human women
i really did not think sonic  would go that far with elise and sonic but they did and it was just plain disgusting
sonic isnt shadow for one and for two sonic should just stick to amywhere the hell is tails in this game
tails was sonics first best friend and sidekick im talking about the games not archie
i never wanted tails to be some infomaniac like ali baba
i think tails should have had a bigger rolerobotnik is evil
then why is erazor evil not the famous egg head
im complaining a lot about the characters i know but its only because his name is being destroyed along with all the other sonic characters
i liked sonic games better back then when robotnik actually killed people
the game seems to be all about speed
half the time i dont even know where im going
i liked sonic games when you could take your time and roam around freely
now there always seems to be one path for our blue hero
not even twoonei think thats about all i have to say
the cons outbalance the pros so thats bad
if i were you i would stick to mario or zelda or metroid or resident evil or whatever youre a fan of until a decent sonic title comes outi grew up playing this speedster hedgehog and after seeing a new sonic game out for the wii and for the price i thought it would bring back those fond memories of when i first played sonic  sadly this game crushed that thought pretty quickly
the short story info is that sonic is trying to help a gennie keep some powerful rings from falling into the hands of an evil djinn so he cant take over the arabian nights world
the levels are pretty much from all past sonic games basically racing through collecting gold rings bopping enemies along your path and trying to get the highest score and fastest time on the level
there is one thing that made it a little more entertaining is that sonic has two magic rings and with enough points can upgrade them to speed up time or slow it downala prince of persia
the one annoying hassle i had with this game was the idiotic camera angles they used  theres one level where there are dinosaurs and you have a couple of triceratops chasing you as youre trying to outrun them you have to dodge certain obstacles in your path  not a problem if you have a front view but this area only gave you the backwards view as such you didnt have enough time to dodge the obstacles in your path since you dont see them until it was to late
now you do have the ring and can slow down time but heres a little drawback on that as well you have to power up the rings with white power globes in the levels if you dont have enough power the rings wont work and you have to gather a great deal of these power globes to make the rings work
for me at the end it was to boring and to annoying to bother with this game while there  might be some cute cutscenes with sonic at the end it just turned out to be a three dimensional running game  and as i said it just seemed to reminiscent of past sonic games and while you first play it it seems fun after ten minutes the enjoyment wears thin
so for the price and for any hardcore sonic fans than sure buy it today  but if youre getting this and expecting more than just the running through levels than pass this over and try something elsewell i kinda like this gamethe story mode is terrible
the gameplay is not like any other sonic game
i mean that in a bad way
first of all it takes sonic forever to speed up
second the controls are obsurdly bad
they are confusing and unresponsive
an ordinary sonic fan would expect to press the jump button twice to do the homing attack but no
you have to charge up your jump to jump very high to get a lock on to the enemy then wiggle the wii remote
sounds simple but when theres a chain of enemies its terrible
sega should have stuck with pressing the jump button multiple timesbut story mode aside the party mode is a little fun
its boring when playing with computers but im guessing that its fun on multiplayeroverall you do not want to get this game
try sonic and the black knight
thats way better than thisafter playing vf on my ps i had to make this one of the first games i got for my ps
unfortunately they only upgraded the graphics not the gameplayit is basically more of the same old thing if not less
most of the moves are the same as the last one with little new ones
there are some new characters but they are basically combinations of othersthere is no incentive to solve the game
you can play through the arcade version and if youre good enough maybe you can beat that silver chick but thats about it
the quest mode is basically just a rehash of the older game
move up in rank fight tougher foes get a new item of clothing or sunglasses and thats about itif you are just playing the gamess ai it will get boring quick
it might be fun to invite your friends over and beat the living snot out of them but even that will get old after awhilei really expected a lot more than what this game offered but as i mentioned it was made so that it could be one of the first games available for the new gen of consoles
if they make a vf hopefully theyll add more to the game than just graphicsif you want a good fighting game this game would be youre first choice right
wrong tekken  dark resurrection is the best fighting game on ps get that from the psn for  it downloads directly to your ps and can then be accessed at any time without any need of a discthis game is a little boringthe fight engine is slow and dullno awesome movestekken is way bettereven little big planet is more funthe game play is fun until you finish it the first timethen you realize how bad the controls are and how hard it is to learn the moves
i pretty much traded it out within a couple of weeksi would have thought that after  versions of this game that someone would have thought about the controlsor gameplay in generalthe goodthe graphics are great
vivid colors smooth action sequences nice fighting movesetc etcthe badcontrols suckthis game would have been alot better with multiplayer
but having no multiplayer makes the game become a low scorethis is one of those games that sat in my closet for about  years or so before i got around to playing it which i finally did
i knew it had a great reputation but it seemed like i was always too busyalas
i should have played it seven years ago when it first came out
many games that old can still hold their own im thinking of saythief  the metal ageandhalflife at such a remove but this one cantthe graphics are dated obviously dated
under the circumstances this would be an absurd complaint but fishing through these amazon reviews suggests that the graphics struck players as clunky and dated even at the time of the games release
in any case you are really gonna notice it by this pointtheres also the issue of the gameplay which is as obviously dated
basically you walk around talking to people with menu options as to what to reply
i hope youre into this sort of archaic dosstyle gameplay because thats all this game consists ofi got about halfway through this game before i got my hands on a walkthrough which i liberally peeked at as i played the rest of the game
this is because as another reviewer notes elsewhere the puzzles dont make any sense so the game is more frustrating than rewarding
itd be one thing if the puzzles were hard but required careful listening and maybe some fundamentals of science to solve correctlybut in this game the solution to the puzzles is invariably non sequitur  what finally works only works because of the gamewriters whimsies
the only way to solve the game short of a walkthrough is simply pick up everything you can stuff it in your inventory then try to give everything to every character or try to jam everything into every object you come acrossi do not find this edifyingand as for the dippy aprils opining yeah right
every time theres a plot twist that got old pretty fastworks fine with vista by the wayat present gb ps should be regarded as a lowcost next gen optical disk player rather than a game system as it is clear that there are more bd movie titles than ps game titles
ps has a fantastic capability to play all optical disk formats except dvdram dvdaudio and hddvd
it can also play bdre and bdr including a dual layer bd with gb capacity
it can even play sacd
i need to add that ps lacks p upconversion feature that most of upcoming new bd players will have
otherwise the noise from the cooler fan is somewhat disturbing especially in a quiet scene
it is just like watching a dvd movie on a highend pc for gamers in a quiet roomon the contrary as a game console ps still needs to solve problems such as  lack of vibration feature of a controller  imcompatibility of some ps titles and  inability to share saved data between ps and ps
until we see enough p game software titles for ps and positive progresses in the problems ps will be regarded as an inexpensive bd player with gaming capabilityfor anyone that would like to have both bd and hddvd capability to avoid the platform issue ps may not be a good choice as a bdhddvd dual player will be avialable soon and it will initially cost around  which is less than buying two players separatelynetnet i think ps is an inexpensive bd player and a good product for heavy gamers and early bd adoptors
that said sony seems to be planning to introduce a more inexpensive next version ps soon to solve some of the issueslet me preface by saying that i have spent enough time with my playstation  to make this claim
my brother and i went in on it together and stood in line on release to get a gb system
by the way the difference in gb  gb is almost nonexistantdont be fooled they are the same system
anyhow we bought the resistance fall of man game because we heard that it was the killer app for the system release
we played it for a bit but immediately we could tell that that particular game was rushed
not only that but the ps system seemed to be getting extraordinarily hot while playing
after playing the system for about a week we decided that it was just too soon to get a ps
the amount of glitches and quality of games outweighed the value of the price
we have much more fun with the wii or the  and they are fairly priced
therefore we found that those latter were a better buy
however if you  have confidence that the blue ray format is the wave of the future then by all means this baby is sweet
the ps is also a substitute for a personal  computer too
since we already own enough computers and we really dont think blue ray will win out we decided to return the system to best buy and get an xbox  with gears of warit is sooooo sweetwell what can i say age of empires  was a horrible game however this came with the best sequel ever age of empires  amazing
pros age of empires  with the conquers expansioncons age of empires  horrible  bit graphics for aoe  overpowered civilizations
hard even when its on easy mode
overall a  out of this game is very frustrating i used to play it on the original sega genesis and it was not very fun
my brother almost beat this game however if you want to play this game the mega sonic collection plus has this game its still frustratingthe background story is extremely silly and theres no way to measure your progressbrain ageis the better deal as you can compare the results of multiple users and it also has sudokuas an adult gamer i didnt care for this game
i have tried brain age and i think its so much better than brain boost gemma wave
brain boost is just a memory game period
there is nothing else to do on it except just to test your memory
 ways to test your memory numbers pictures and colors
each test was pretty long
after awhile i got bored with it quickly
for variety get brain age or brain academyeven my nephews ages  and  didnt care for it either
they liked brain age betterwe own the big brain academy the brain age and this one
big brain ac
is far the best one
for kids and adults as it has different difficulties
you cannot put it away
the brain age is ok but my son  doesnt like it
i like it for the sudoku
gamma wave is not a hit
at the beginning is a story you dont need and then you just turn it off again because it is boring
dont waste your money on that oneim am not a golfer however my family and i love the golf minigame in wii sports
so to get a greater fix i purchased this game
unfortunately this game is not nearly as fun as the wii sports versionaside from the lame story which i can forgive the control scheme feels very much like they slapped the wiimotes abilities on top of a button masher
for example in wii sports golf the power of your swing is determined by the force of your swing in ssg you sloooooowly rock your arm back and press a button to set the power
this takes a huge element of fun out of the game in my opinion
this game might be fun on a traditional console but a wii game it is noti plan on trading this one in save your money for a future golf game that more closely mimics wii sports natural flowsuper swing golf is a weird amalgomation of elements that dont quite all come together
based upon a korean massively multiplayer online golf game it inherited a really really long gameplay curve is ridiculously difficult and candy coated with a cutsey art style
and welded onto a wiimote swing interfacewhile the idea of playing golf with a wii controller is sound by the th time youve swung the remote and wondered why your ball hooked sharply left youll be wishing they spent a little more time on creating some sort of feedback to why your swing keeps failing
at least in real life you know that its your fault
here they require you to mimmock the subtlties of a realworld golf swing in order to be successful but dont actually let you know how to do that or even what that would bedespite accessible appearances this game is actually ridiculously difficult
the initial learning curve is punishing especially on your stroke
in real golf it can take years to get to the point where youre hitting par on every hole
in super swing golf youd better be hitting part on every hole by your third opponentlike so many other games in its genre this one is all about buying clothes
you need to get money to get clothes to swing better to get more money etc
its a viscious cycle that just keeps going
and with literally hundreds of items and hundreds of tournaments there are literall hundreds of hours of gameplay here
if you can get through the first five without throwing your wiimote out the window that isthis game is huge and deep and i really wanted to like it more than i did
but with a hugely frustrating learning curve its just a glorified exercise in anger management
if you really want a wii golf game and have a lot of time to invest in one you could do worse
however this game in no way encompases the fun and accessible mantra that the wii has made its popularity uponas a multiplayer game it beats wii sports golf thats the nicest thing i can say
tecmo missed a great opportunity here to merge real golf aspects with all the fun obstacles of minigolf in a fantasy d environment that would never be possible in the real world
from the demo videos thats what super swing golf appears to be but its not
its a generic golf game that uses generic anime characters and a rough story line to try and bring golf to the wiiunless you just really love wii sports golf and want something a little better pass on this until it hits the bargain rack
its just not an a list kind of gameill start by stating that i was a big fan of the madden games until i played segas nfl k on the ps
after ea bought the exclusive rights to the nfl games i was rather peeved
madden  for the ps just enforces the reasons for my dismaypros nfl foolball improved graphics from the previous generation of video game consoles not by the leaps and bounds youd expect though  thats about itcons graphics not up to the quality youd expect from next gen technology controls feel off especially on defense change of the speed burst button from x to rthis was very difficult to get used to createaplayer was ruined
yeah it was kind of cheap to be able to build the perfect player
now you have to participate in drills to set your created players attributes
while fine in theory the drills think scounting combinebench press yd dash etc werent well executed
i really noticed the off feel of the controls while running through a tackling drill with a lb
it was the same setup as the minicamp drill from previous games which i normally ruled at but i could barely make a tackle
the players just didnt feel responsivebottom line this game felt rushed
i had a feeling ea would let the quality of their nfl game slip now that theres no competition
i cant even recommend renting this game let alone buying it
it really seems that all of ea sports titles are slipping greatly in terms of qualityif you remember when madden  was released for the ps the game was still much better on the the ps simply because it was on the console for several years and the bugs were worked out and the gameplay was smooth
seems that history has repeated itself in making the shift to the ps
i purchased this recently used for about  and played it
i also played the ps version quite a bit and the gameplay and overall quality of the product is much better on the ps version
i quickly cut my losses and sold the ps version for about 
at this point im playing madden  for the ps on my hdtv
hey its just more fun that way
at least until they improve the quality of the ps version to a comparable levelmediocre at best
id actually rate it at   stars
i like the graphics but the gameplay is not all that smooth
if you havnt bought it yet id wait until aug and get   hopefully theyll have it worked out by then
i definately miss the hot routesits very difficult to control this game
dont be cheap and buy the newer madden for wii
its much better to controli got this game due to best ratings
i didnt mind having team mates that were useless and didnt mind bias cops but some of these races just dont make sense
i was hoping for more reason to do free roaming but you can jump to any location which makes me lazy
the upgrades are to cheap and to easy to get
overall this is a fun game but i really think its boring to vs the same people you just beat in the last stage yet they are like good all of a sudden
plus i havent played every nfs game but these chasing the person to get points is stupid to me
i have never seen it and just think it is plain bad
i like racing to be honest not tagthis game is very poorly programmed
the judges make huge errors on the scoring and statistics
the announcer makes incorrect comments during the fight
the replays are completly the opposite of what the announcer is saying
the game keeps saying it can not connect yet all other games and internet work fine
there is no update system
the menu system is very unintuitive and boring
the music stinks unless you like rap
the controller is very difficult to master or sometimes does not do what it is suppose to
the load times are slow
the game has crashed my system a few times
i have still managed to have some fun so i gave it a very generous   i could have given more details but with all these flaws it would have been extremely long windedthe good great graphics amazing detail on the fighters
you can see each bead of sweat and each drip of blood is stunning detail
the light reflects off their skin making the game feel very realistic sound effects pretty good sound from the crowds and when landing a hitthe bad terrible load times it takes forever for this game to load
it is very annoying and detracts from the game
also creating your boxers face is nearly impossible with the slow load time
you the next hair style and  seconds later it finally loads
i cant believe they released the game with such horrendous load times difficult controls using the right analog stick takes some getting used to and it is very hard to through combinations
blocking is also tricky lackluster gameplay its hard to get into a fight
once you get into the career mode your first few fights are fun because you can win with authority
after that the fights drag on and on and it takes forever to get a knockout career mode has no structure theres a bar that fills up with your popularity but thats about it
no ranking no percent progress nothing music same  rap songs get annoying very fast training voice over during training and between rounds the trainers comments are annoying to the point of muting the tv no autoload at initial start up
so every time you play the game you need to manually load your profile
stupidmaybe im just a little too picky about my controls but i found those used in this game to be needlessly complex and extremely difficult to use
while the graphics are very good i found fight night round  to be lacking in virtually all other respects
in the times ive played it i succeeded in little more than being a punching bag for the computer generated fighters
i generally consider myself to be pretty good at video games but this was one i just couldnt master or even get into
rent it before you buyi like most racing games and i thought this game looked amazing especially with the new motion controls but boy i was way off
this game is beautiful graphicwise
it has many cars to choose from
the gameplay was solid and hasnt changed too much from the other games
those were the few positives of nfs carbonnow we get to the negatives
the controls are the worst part of this game making it the reason it got two stars
if it wasnt for the poor controls this game could be great
the controls seemed clear in the instruction manual but were extremely confusing difficult and frusturating in the game
they only work about half the time
the car seemed to do the opposite of what i wanted it to do
it also seemed as if i had barely any control of the car
i also remember turning the wii remote almost all the way around to do a simple turn
i cant even describe how frusturating it is to be in first place and almsot done with the race but then crash or fall due to poor controls
i know that most people who say a game has poor controls dont take the time to figure them out carefully but i did
i read the instructions which is only a few pages and examined my motions carefully
ive read that you can change the controls to using the thumbstick but thats just boring
if you want to control a car with a control stick get save some money and buy it for another system
and besides whats the point of having motion controls that barely work
i also wish this game had an option to change the time of day at a race
all the races take place at night which is pretty cool but it can be a little hard to see sometimes
i also got tired of always racing at nightbasiclly nfs carbon has poor controls that leave you frantically flailling the wii remote all over the place
it seems like ea took time on the gameplay and graphics but just carelessly threw in the controls
i highly reccomend buying this on another system like the ps
this game is only for diehard nfs fans
thanks for readingthe hd dvd player is not noisy at all but the xbox  is way too loud and it seems as though the  has to stay on while the dvd player is running
too bad because i really wanted this to work
i have a fall  xbox  premium with hdmiits nice you can look a great quality in video and movies but the graphics on this game are decent but not great
it is apparent that some effort went into designing the buildings bridges etc
the real weakness of the game is the lack of a plot
yes there is an excellent game intro
once you start the game you get a nice if threadbare plot
then you start the play the missions and you get mission briefings that do little to advance the plot
i expected something anything to move the story alongrent it for an hour of fun but do not waste the money to buy itthis is a game i would have expected to play on super nes or sega back in the sthe worlds are like playing inside of a poorly drawn autocad drawing with a noticable lack of detailthe game play will not draw you in unless you are drawn in by frustration and repetiveness
ive played the game for hours trying to figure out why they made it in the first placeand i can hoenstly say i still dont know why the large robots are fighting to begin withpoor story setupsince its  i assume there are  other ones out there
if you liked those dont let me get in the way of you liking this one if this is your thing
but there are so many other games out there that a person will actually have fun playing why waste time on this halfeffort with too many menus and options to go throughi tried playing final fantasy xi a few times since it came out for pc  maybe
and i had to move on
the first time through things really slowed down around level   you need to do a very annoying quest to get your subjob otherwise youre useless in parties
also around level  you make a crazy long and dangerous journey to a big city to get your chocobo which involves you sitting down at your computer for  to  hours
the game gets so ridiculous with the time required to do anything  and you can forget about going solo
quests didnt yield any experience points so your only way to level was to fight
once you hit levels  through  doing that by yourself becomes extremely lengthy and tedious
monsters that seem like a decent challenge will really mess you up  fighters can take hits but cant cure poison
mages can do a lot of damage but spells take time to cast and get interrupted
red mages almost cut it but dont have a lot of hit points  in short if you dont have a good party your experience points per hour will be terribly lowthe second time i played the game last summer its  right now there werent enough people playing to even make parties
there were only about k people logged on to my server period
before there were nearly that many within shouting distancei went to world of warcraft
its possible to get things done in shorter periods of time and not nearly as dependent on partying with others
ultimately ffxi had some good ideas but world of warcraft pretty much fixed all the problems i had with ffxii am still in the recovery process from this game
for over a year i would spend  hours a day playing this game and even though its been a year since ive quit i still have the desire to go back and play more
the game involves hours and hours of sitting around waiting for everthing to work together so you can spend minutes actually fighting
when everything works together it is fun dont get me wrong but i assure you that everything working together is rarethere is another problem with gil
it takes a lot of work and i mean work to get money on this game and to add to your troubles item and equipment are ridiculously overpriced
the time you need to commit to this game is again increasedif your interested in buying this game to try it i will tell you what to look forward to hours of frustration as you wait
you wait for a party wait for it to get organized wait for them to find something to fight wait for people to recover wait for new party members because people leave
and after all of that waiting what have you accomplished
nothing
strangly the game still manages an alure that will have you comming back to it over and over again hoping for the world but recieving nothing but frustration
it takes real commitment and sacrifice to play this game more than im willing to givethough my criticism is going to hurt all the fans of this game but i must be honest
the games good great graphics enemies and surroundings
the designes and makers were brilliant and did produce an awesome game
two bad things are that there are too many enemies though i dont mind coming to fight and sometimes the characters do not follow commands as ive spend  days bashing my head on the floor now ive got a headachemost of the time you try to attack but the characters take too long to follow and end up being stricken
unlike defiance it has camera angel problems as well as the ability to set your nerves on fire
i wouldnt recommend this to people who have anger management problem short temper but i would recommend it for people who are mad about samurai gamesgenji is set in ancient japan that is supposed to be actually historical however when you run into giant crabs and ladies floating around with butterfly wings you start to question that conceptthe graphics are awesome obviously next generation quality and great sound to make you feel like youre in mythical japanthe problems with the game are obvious
youll start playing the game and then when a battle is over youll have no idea where to go or what to do so youll start wondering all over the map until a cut scene startsthe camera doesnt help either
all too often your character will be fighting something offscreen or your character will disappear through a wall and youll have no idea what or if youre hitting anything and youll get frustrated when you die because you couldnt see what was happeningthe game play is hack and slash
all that happens is kill this giant crab wonder around go through the door activate cut scene repeat
theres no variety in the game play that keeps the player interestedif the game had fixed the weak points which could have been very easy for some such as the camera this could have been at least an average game
but these flaws are not acceptable for games anymore if they ever were and more should be expected for a next generation gameprosgreat graphicsset in mythical ancient japanconsno idea where to gorepetetive and straight forward gameplaywhere am i
camerawell the fact is this is a game you shouldnt buy unless you see it in a  bargain bin and only if your curious but im tellin ya its a waste of time
it looks good
actually it looks great
i just cant for the life of me figure out how they could have screwed the camera up so bad
the fact is you have no control of the camera  it zooms in and out on its own and moves to akward angles
this can be really frustrating ecpesially when your getting shot at by archers and the camera zooms in so you cant dodge
i got to the second level and never touched the game again
in fact i traded it for resistance
it could easly have been a good launch title if they didnt ignore years of what other d action games could have taught themthis game is crap
and im even coming from the whole it was made in late angle
this game could be average but the controls and shooting are some of the worst ive ever seen
that puts it down several pegs
i dont even know why it got such good reviews when it came out
bad story terrible storytelling awful controls bad shooting frustrating gameplay lackluster multiplayer and to top it all off the game is fairly short
me and a friend cooped and beat the game on hard in a single hour sessionone thing coop is hilarious
when you revive your buddy what the hell are you doing
is it magic
and whats with the sound
me and several friends all agreed after spending an hour playing it this game is crap
dont even bother with it
if the second one is any good this one destroyed any chance of me buying iti bought this for its coop capability wanted to play with adult son
unfortunately its just another run shoot run linear game with no imagination or interesting aspects
if you just want to exchange gunfire with bad guys have at it
i like something a bit more adventurous and engagingthis game straight up suuuuuuucks i bought resistance  from a friend but i wanted to play the first game to get the full story before i went on nathan hales second mission
but um this game sucks hard i played about half way through and just put this game back on the shelf
controls feel cheap especially controlling vehicles and the graphics suck suck suck
the only reason it gets two stars is because the story kind of kept me interested and the ai is smart
i think ill just wikipedia this story instead
pass on this gameupdate ok  i finally played the whole game through still stand by my original review
the key here is that the ai is smart and the story is pretty cool but at the end of the day it feels like a poor mans haloi bought my ps for bluray playback but decided to give resistance fall of man a try
compared to gears of war halo  or cod on my  this game is a  at best
the graphics look dated the ai is bad the multiplayer isnt fun
also the game maxes at p for resolution and dont let the  players get you excited like it did me psn cant handle it and you will be lucky if you can get in a match with  playersi have probably played no more than five hours of this game and have gone back to my  and wii
this game often gets compared to gear of war but they are not even in the same league
this game has more in common with a game like return to castle wolfenstein than it does any of the current shooters availableif all you have is a ps than this game is worth getting because honestly there isnt much else
but if you have a  and a ps stay away from this one and play the better shooter games available on the  if you need to try it a rental is the only way to go
i wish i did that or downloaded the demo
from now on i will not buy ps games without trying the demogame is fun in the beginning when it is beatable but later the opponents will not try to win in favor of stopping you from winning
they will slow when you are stuck behind them
also the menu selection process is slow and non intuitive
i could not figure what i was suppose to do
do you have to come in first on all races etc
loading and selecting the vehicles was slow
i could not finish as it got too difficult and frustrating and repetitiveel juego fue parte del combo para la ps gb asi que uno siempre le busca el lado positivopero un juego que se jacta de soportar hasta  jugadores como es posible que no sea capaz de simplemente dejar que dos controles se conecten y puedan jugaruno se pregunta si los disentildeadores son inexpertos o simplemente no les importa ofrecer un buen producto para obligarlo a comprar otro
verdaderamente una decepcionen si el juego es bueno sino fuera por lo anterior y definitivamente no vale la pena comprarlopros cant think of any ummmmaybe the vivid colors maybecons everything
gets really frustrating and repetitive even some will say its not
go for some other racing game this is not worth the money rentalmaybefirst off the game looks feels and appears amazing
best graphics and handling of a racing game ive seen
however it gets boring real quick
there are very few tracks and you just keep doing them over and over and the only thing that changes is the type of vehicle you drive and the difficulty
and the few tracks that there are arent even that fun to begin with
im only on level two and im already boredget this game if you like cheap thrills but if youre looking for substance and replayability this game suckstake a lesson from off road fury  they had a ton of great tracks
you could upgrade your vehicle buy new vehicles and there was even a story mode
this game gives you no incentive to keep playingyears ago when sony dragged the thennew ps to the dew action sports tour this was my favorite game
i love racing games and i played this one for as long as theyd let metoo bad so many other racing games came out between then and nowthe intervening years have not treated this game very well
its pretty sad looking nowand not very funsighnot the best game but not that bad
if your into racing game you may like it but if your a hard core gamer your may notthis game wasnt fun for me at all
it was to hard riding the bike and its just a boring game overall
planing to trade it in for beowulfthought i would give this game a go again
i figured its approaching on  years so it must be much better now right
wrong
still has bugs from launch day that have never been fixed along with a host of others
never have i played such a buggy pay to play mmo its just pathetic
and the development team consists of  or  people and admittedly by this very dev team they dont even have a person to fix graphic bugs
seriously
and were supposed to pay monthly for thati upgraded my computer when i got this game
this game is still laggy even at low graphic levels
just for interest i compared the game play with world of warcraft
vanguard felt like it was playing underwater
i finally just stopped playing
why
i was not fun and i did not care for the gaming community
this may change over time
i just want to add that i came into this game being a past player of eq eq yuck daoc and wow
i was hoping to recapture the original eq but did not find it in this gametonyi dont understand what happened to this hyped game
it feels so empty and shallow
the terrain looks pretty but it has no life no substance
everything feels robotici love mmos and i have looked forward to playing this game for a long long time
i am one of the few who loved star wars galaxies the first yearthe world in swg even though it lacked quests felt alive and interactable
you could make your own content if needed
this doesnt seem true for vanguardi forced myself as painful as it was to played to lvl  and got my horse thinking it would start getting betteruhhnope
i just cant even bring myself to log into the thing againyes maybe it will get better after some patches but i wont be around to enjoy it
i managed to get into lord of the rings online beta a while back and it is much better in beta  and  than vanguard is at launchman i am more willing to go play some eq than play vanguard
some of you may love vanguard and i envy you
i just cant get into itbecause it is definitely not worth full price
id been wanting to try this game for a while hearing about being able to ride dragons and things and control the flying parts of the game sounded cool
it was fun for a while after i spent two days going back and forth with tech support trying to figure out why it did not work
after their ideas bore no fruit i decided to take matters into my own hands and looked at the ini file
it was as simple as changing the default resolution from x to x my monitor is the only part of my computer that has remained the same for the last  years and does not support higher settings
from there it was just a matter of making a character and starting the game
it was fun for a while i played it for two days before i ran into some major problems
one more day than i played wow before i gave up on it but that was only a demo and cost me nothing
anyway the first problem was that there are nasty things too close to the newbie area
i saw the only hostile creature in the area two seconds before it saw me and since it was  levels higher it made short work of me
the second problem is a lack of exact location determination your waypoint is marked on your compass and on your map but only a general idea of where that person or place is will be shown
the mini map does not zoom in enough to detail where it is and i gave up on the game all together when i was told my trainer was in a temple that i spent  minutes circling the solid rocks that the map and compass said contained him
a simple trail like the eq games have would have made this situation not become so frustrating
ill keep an eye on vgplayers for updates but my last  days on the free  are going to be unused and im going to be sure to cancel the subscription until i see an update that fixes these problems
i was not looking forward to the bad parts of other mmorpgs which were patched to remove them like corpse retrieval and harvesting to make little pieces to be combined later but now i dont have to worry about thatalthough i cant imagine anyone being interested in this game anymore if you are thinking about giving this game a try i highly recommended that you dont
i know its pretty cheap at the moment and if a cheap basketball game is all youre looking for i would try an older k or nba live game
way too easy a lack of good game modes boring gameplay and the fact that its offline now are some of the problems this game has however the graphics are pretty good and its quite easy to just pick up and play
so if youre looking for a cheap and easy basketball game that you can play quickly with friends i guess this wouldnt be a bad optionokay the idea of the game is this the rapture has happened and the antichrist is on the loose
its your job to convert as many people in the game before jesus returnsthe only way to get more characters on your side is to convert them
hence the spiritual warfare aspect of the game
you can train your converts to be pastors missionaries gospel singers prayer warriors etc
you can also have them build buildings to house more converts to train house and feed them
this sounds like a lot of micromanaging and it is
the point and click aspect is only fun for so long
not to mention the fact that the ai is a little dim and you constantly have to tell them what to do without them doing it themselvesone nice part of the game is its mapped view of new york city
however the streets feel constricted so you cannot move your otherwise enormous army around very easily
plus even though new york is mapped there are limited varieties of the buildings
that might be okay if you could earn them but the game only lets you get what it will let youthe characters all look the same even after you convert them
they do change to the same outfit after awhile but its still a pain to tell them apartthe game does offer online play but only to play as the peacekeeping forces
you also gain access to all their powers
like doctors and collegesoh im so scaredthe game is well crafted to be a decent rts game without being annoying on the christian angle
this is at least more interesting than the bible game
but i still give it the same score because of the poor graphics micromanagement and repetitive boring game play
if youre buying this game for its funfactor and not its religious content youre going to regret paying for itprossomewhat easy to learnlots of different unitsconsmicromanagementbad graphicsboring game playi enjoy my ps from time to time
i dont have any games but i download demos on occasion to give games a try
i loved the ps controllers they were the same size just about but they were heavier and felt soooooo much better in your hands
im sorry im an adult with bigger hands than a kid
i dont like how light the controllers are
the other huge letdown was the l and r buttons that are hinged at the top instead of being regular pushin buttons
why they decided to do that i dont know because it feels awful pressing into them
what was wrong with the old school controllers that had normal r l buttons
i loathe it when companies change things that are perfectly fine the way they are
ive also had the controller unsync during a game
not like the battery was low but the bluetooth hiccuped for a second and had to reassign the controller
it only happens in a split second but ummm when youre playing a racing game and your controller freezes ive seen my car vere to the left for an extra second causing me to crash or the controls actually reversed once lol
so instead of going left like i wanted to i vered right
i actually returned the game rental and rented on the  instead and the game played so much betterproslong battery lifequick recharge timethey look like the classic ps controllersconsno rumble featuretoo light causing it to feel cheaploses bluetooth connection from time to timethe r l hinged buttons are a terrible ideain short i am considering buying the new dualshock controller because its a few ounces heavier
and i have a logitech usb controller which is great but it doesnt work with some games and its usb so it doesnt turn the ps on or off im trying to sell my normal controllers lolyeah i bought the console with an extra controller  if you like heavier controllersxbox orig  ps dreamcast you will not like the feel of this controllerdont like the fact that it costs  and you also have to pay an aditional  just to get the usb cable to use it
i think that if it costs that much it should come with the cablethe idea of no more wires was exciting to me when i got my new consoles
i got my ps in jan and both of the wireless controllers batteries are having a hard time holding a charge
the battery in the ps controller is not replacable like the xbox
when the battery loses its charge you either have to keep it wired to the ps so it will work or you have to buy a new  cotroller
you really have no other choice at this point but be aware
also the l l r r buttons are flimsey and very close together
i dont have very large hands but after a few hours i start to crampi have the benefit of not having played the ps
which means i never got used to the ps controller
ive played the gamecube original xbox s controller logitech knockoffs mad catz knockoffs and now the best the xbox  controllerwe recently added a ps to our collection and while im impressed with the console hardware much higher quality than the  i think sony missed an opportunity to modernize this controllerthe left thumbstick is just broken
if you take away the two thumbsticks you basically have the original ps controller
the sticks were tacked on in response to nintendos innovative thumbstick for the nintendo  and theyre still tacked on
your left thumbstick which is the primary control is unnaturally low
the distance from the triggers to the thumbstick is too far
my  year old can play the xbox and gamecube conrollers but complained within minutes of his hands hurting while trying to play formula  on the ps
also id like a little more resistance in the sticksafter going back to the xbox controller they almost felt too stiff in comparison so maybe theres a happy mediumwhich brings me to the triggers 
i think the level of control with the xbox triggers is more precisei never thought a controller could weigh too little but this one does
id prefer the heft of most the other controllers which comes from having rumble feedback and larger batteries to run the rumbleon the plus side you can charge it with a standard usb cable without having to buy the play and charge kit that microsoft sells
also its more intuitive getting it connected to your consolei understand that controllers are a matter of personal preferenceand if youve played hours on the ps then  youre probably going to love the ps controller
but i think an objective look at it would conceded that they should have evolvedthe xbox controller has evolved twice since the duke came out originallyprosweapons are niceconsgraphics should be bettersingle player is too short and the storyline is incoherentmultiplayer has vertical bars when playing splitscreen on widescreen hdtvmindless run and gunconclusiondont buy into the marketing hype
halo is up there with ipods in my humble opinion
if you want to play a good fps get the orange box or bioshock  both make halo look ridiculously bad in comparison of people who preordered halo  limited edition and received it a week and a half late only to discover that the discs had fallen off the mount and got severely scratched up in transiti got the game last night and sent the discs in for replacement today
i didnt bother to even try to use the discs the scratches were deep enough to look almost like the disc got dropped on rocky pavement and run over by a truckdont mind the stars i gave this game low stars because i just received my copy of halo  limited edition and it came really scratched
as a video game collector i was very disappointed other than that the game is absolute  and i really recommend getting it if you own a xboxi love first person shooters ive played tons of them making me wonder why this game is so praised
half of the aliens are comedy relief who crack lame jokes run around like ewoks with laser guns
the other groups of aliens run around in colorful suits of armor making them less of a threat and more of a joke
the ally ai was a joke most of the time id have to drive around dodging while my ai lackie missed every shot
taking the turret over i had nothing more to do than laugh as he plows head on into the enemy tank and i get turned into bacon stripsthe game seems to want to be the movie aliens but more light hearted
it was generic shooter all the way and even more so online
im missing something im sure since the game wasnt what people were telling me it was
most of the guns sound like toys and master chief looks like hes made of plastic
a minor complaint i have is the game isnt hd its p scaled up to p so thats standard definition confusing me since its supposed to be a next gen gamethe helmet is nothing more than a tiny decoration for you to put on a shelf to gather dust and house spiders making the price insane for something like thisin short halo  is nothing short of a generic shooter which isnt bad but it doesnt live up to the hype in the least its nothing ground breaking and in my opinion its not worth  dollars never the less the price you pay for the helmet pack a good rental at bestthis game must have a kind of cult following with all the positive reviews because i just dont get it
warhawk is likely the worst ps game ive played to date
to start with there is absolutely no tutorial or any place to practice
you are instantly tossed into chaos before you even know which button shoots
the single solitary reason i gave this  stars instead of  is flying
the planes are fun to fly around in thats it nothing else worth a second look herethe games only purpose is combat yet the combat is awfulsimply awful
i always hated war games where there is an advantage to jumping around
here comes warhawkyou will immediately see people jumping through the air like a bunch of ballerinas fighting a war
it just looks so stupid
in real life do you think soldiers are jumping around on the battle field
there is a crouch option which gives you no advantage at all
so jumping is good sneaking crouchingis useless hmmmmokthe absolute stupidest most irritating thing about this game is how the knives are the best freaking weapon to usein a gunfight
wait until you get online and see how many people are running around with knives
you can be shooting someone with a machine gun and they will run up to you and stab you
you die faster from a stab wound in this game then from  rounds at close range with an assault rifle
there were hundreds of times where i am unloading my weapon into a guy and hes still running towards me to the point of me wondering if im even hitting him despite the crosshairs being directly on him
im serious i even snuck up directly behind a guy and shot him in the head did he drop dead
nohe turned around and stabbed me then i die
okbasically all the war consists of is a bunch of guys running around like chickens without heads and jumping through the air
it reminds me of the lame online combat of socom  for the ps
dogfights in the air are clunky and depend on sheer luck
driving tanks is awkward and they explode far too easily
i really could list more annoying features but its even bothering me while i type this so i shall stop
in closing the graphics arent even all that impressive
im sticking with call of duty which is light years ahead of this kiddie nonsensei bought this review after reading some reviews and watching commercials and videos of the game
the cut scenes look really good with the exception that there is no blood
not trying to be gorybut when someone gets shot with an arrow and they zoom in to that characterthe absence of blood makes the whole thing look incomplete
that being saidthe main bad guy king bohan is the most impressive villain ive seen in any game
his dialogue his demeanor and gesturescouldnt be better
that is my favorite part of the gamethe game is really short and the action is basically mashing the square and triangle buttons hoping that you nailed a combo
there are way to many combos to memorizeand by the time you get the hang of itthe game is overprobably close to  if not more combosthe sixaxis controller part was frustrating at firstbut once i got the hang of itit was actually one of the more enjoyable parts of the gamewait for it to be in the bargain bin before buying itor rent it for a couple of daysthat should be enough time to play through it twicethis was actually the second ps game i ever played
graphics and cut scenes of landscapes was amazing
you can see the detail and work that went into ithad a hard time memorizing so many combos as distinctly prefer games without combos
ended up using  or  combos for the game nowwhy  stars
the combos got to the point i ended up putting the game aside for  weeks only to start again to find did not know how to play anymore without going to the combo chart to relearn them
right now more so using the  moves and hoping the mashing gets me throughthis was also the first use of the motion control of the hand controller which used in the other character  very fun after the learning curve
fly with your arrow takes on a new meaningthe graphics saves the game but the play value would be a rental
the british accent on supposed asian characters was a distractionseveral months back i was introduced to ninja theorys work through enslaved odyssey to the west
despite the plummeting price point typically indicative of gaming mediocrity i found enslaved wholly intriguing and masterfully crafted
after discovering that andy serkis had also contributed to heavenly swords cinematic and narrative development i decided to immediately make a purchaseheavenly sword took me about  hours to complete on the normal setting
 hours in itself may seem like a valid reason for lowering a review score but surprisingly it does not factor into my scoring
i have always been a fan of quality over quantity
the problem is that the game ultimately falls into  hours of arena battle sword fights  hour of arenaquicktime boss fights  hour of cinematics and  hours of sinaxis slowmotion cannonarrow shootingfor the most part the characters are very engaging with strong individualized personalities and interesting dialogue
the narrative often falls more into bouts of witty dialectic than substantial plot driven revelations but the presentation is so strong that it still draws in the viewer
even  years later with the exception of narikos squidlike hair the facial features are stunning
facial animations and expressions are still lightyears ahead of another game i recently reviewed dead space   the games menu screen that opens after the first battle has some major lip synch issues but these are corrected in every other cinematic
the  scenes with bohan yelling at his son who looks like sloth from the goonies and flying fox preaching his sadistic ideas about style while prancing like the flash are definitely entertaining
the problem is that even  min of great cinema does not draw me back into the  hours that make up the rest of this gamealmost every battle is broken into a room arena hallway or enclosed road and does not allow you to progress until all enemies are defeated within that section
environments are beautifully rendered but ultimately all look similar in design and color
enemies only come in about  varieties of soldier types
more importantly is that  the only major difference when facing enemies is how often they block how many hits they take to kill and how often they strike with unblockable attacks
without exception enemies just dont feel unique like they do in other action games
the combat system also doesnt do much to keep the game from feeling repetitivethe heavenly sword can be used in three different styles speed power and ranged
each style has its own set of combo attacks and by holding r power l ranged or no shoulder button speed you can combine combos with the square regular and triangle hard attacks
the game actually has a multitude of combos to use
the problem is that despite changing the style every combo is just a combination of square and triangle
so depending on which style you use you are still using combos that look like      or  or     
when you dont touch any buttons nariko will block a blue attack
pressing triangle during an attack will trigger a lethal counter
since you are stringing together so many combos only using a few buttons you ultimately end up button mashing combos and keeping different styles in mind
a typical fight works like this  l ranged  hammer down the buttons r power  hammer down the buttons to kill the powerful enemy  roll away roll away no button for speed  hammer down triangle to hit and try to initiate a counter kill
im sure that somebody could try to memorize each and every combo to try and use it in the best way possible but it became an exercise in tedium for me
mashing buttons while using different styles depending on the enemy type took me to the end of the game with only  deaths
rolling to avoid red attacks also becomes difficult because you cannot stop a combo mid sequence
pressing no buttons to block a blue attack is almost ridiculous because youre almost always midcombo on an attack when you see an enemy light up
quite honestly all of the rolling flipping spinning and slicing through enemies began to make me feel nauseous
the environments enemies and attacks all seem so similar you lose focus on what youre doing and begin to see a blur on the screen
the sinaxis controls are even worsenow i know some people will love controlling the cannon shots and arrows with the sinaxis
the controls are actually decent using the motion controller and have a novelty to them
the problem is that the blur effect used around the object in flight together with the slowmotion ups and downs of your path are ugghnauseating
i have never felt like this in a game before and dismissed several of the reviews here on amazon that mentioned people feeling sick after these sections
well after about an hour of using the motion control i found it could be disabled and you could use the analog to steer
that helped a lot with the swaying to hit your target with motion control but the slowmotion blur effect was still awful
the real problem is that the character you usually use for these sections kai the mentally disturbed cat hat girl can only shoot enemies or jump over them
the levels are extremely bare and offer only a few barrels to shoot with flaming arrows
you have to guide the arrow through fire and onto its target to ignite the gunpowder which results in more boat rocking actionthe ending battle was the highlight of the action and was actually quite engaging
aside from  very short sequences it also didnt feature a string of  second quick time events to memorize like other bosses
ultimately heavenly sword is best described as an experience with extremely tedious gameplay juxtaposed with aaa visuals and cinematics
maybe it will be enough for you but  min of great video was not enough for me to warrant keeping this game in my collection
i can watch any of the lord of the rings to see  hours of andy serkis doing some great voice acting and motioncapture
ninja theory is a very talented company as my review of enslaved notes  i just hope they keep  diversity and lack of motion controls in mind for the reboot of devil may cryso i was looking forward to playing this but i hated it
hated
loathed
i got so frustrated with it that i took it out of my ps and threw it on the ground and let it lay there for a few hours
the stupid throwing of the disk to hit the gong thing is so frustrating i dont care who says it just takes a while to get used to
its annoying  and i never got used to it
theres no meat to the game its just this weak storyline with freakishly sadistic characters  all of whom i could care less about
usually despite any form of annoyance or stupidity i play the game till the end
but not this time
i think im on the last level anyway i hear theres only 
short but at the same time way too long
well ill watch the ending on youtube
im sure it wont blow me awayon the upside the graphics are pretty
but i just started uncharted drakes fortune which completely blows heavenly sword out of the atmosphere hands down
so eh its a double negative from mei understand that this was one of the first releases for the ps
i also understand that because of that there was limited time to put together much of a story or to dedicate time to anything but the game play itself
however i probably could have come up with something a bit more attractive with my zero gaming production experienceyou run around as nariko the girl with the red hair and sometimes as her little sister kai
at first i was struck dumb by the quality of the cut scenes
i swear i could count the pores in everyones skin
so that was a plus
i also enjoyed the button smashing mayhem that was required when playing as nariko
unfortunately video game graphics and button smashing have never sat well with me
its the story im after flexibility of characters sideplot dynamics
all of which heavenly sword pushes to the waysideso onwards
we find ourselves in a loosely strung together story that doesnt exactly make me think that i want to save narikos people
in fact if i were nariko i would have off and smacked those inconsiderate men to kingdom come and back
either way bohan our evil enemy of the story is attempting to wipe out all of narikos people and wishes for nothing but power power power
at first i liked him as a character because of his dialogue which was interesting and fun
i would want nothing more than to skewer him for some of the things he says
of course that likability fled when i realized he was listening to a giant crow and really had no motivation to kill and destroy except for the act of it
i would have liked to see flying fox one of bohans minions be in bohans place
insanity could at the very least been a stand in for a reason
so the story waspitiful
because of this i couldnt really feel for much of the characters
i didnt feel triumphant beating a boss or mildly saddened come the end
nothing
it was two days of my life in a fog of scantily dressed women with a big swordas i said before all you need is the urge to beat the crap out of your controller and youll get through the game
ohh and be wary of some cut scenes or hero sequences when youre killing a boss
theyll throw buttons at you on the screen that you must dutifully push while missing out on the only thing worth playing the game for the graphics
and for all those graphics why is it that nariko looks like she has a giant red squid on her head
irritatingi did however enjoy some of the sixaxis abilities to control cannon balls and kais arrows
in fact i loved little kai
i wish she was in the game more and had a larger repertoire of abilities
but wishful thinking gets you nowherethe thing is that the game as most do had that potential to be something greater than it was
sure its a game if you want to relax and not tear your hair from your scalp in frustration and only spend a few hours on but thats not the point
you pay  dollars for a game slightly less if its used you expect a bit more than a mildly crazy old man attempting to kill a tribe and you missy are the only thing that can stomp him into submission
its a reiterated tale that is far too old for me to care about anymore
 hoursi know i should have listened to other reviews saying this game had awful controls and lot of repetition but what can i say who doesnt love a sexy woman as a main character
spoiler alertthere are times where you are positioned to either snipe with a bow and arrow or defend against an army with a cannon
dont get me wrong that sounds awesome but the controls are way too impractical
i am not complaining that the game is hard by any means just the controls are really sloppy and do not enjoy a game where the player has to adjust due to ugly game mechanics
if you can tolerate the horrible controls then by all means get the game if you cannot then do not even think about getting this gamethis game looks great and has the best face animationsmo caps in a game imo
screen tearing slowdown and some other minor things keep it down thoughthe combat can be fun with  different stance and bunch of button smashing combos but the enemies block everything
the game after a while consist of rolling hitting rolling hitting and repeat
you can just roll and hit the triangle button all game long really
very frustrating
the little girls missions are not fun and controlling the cannon and arrows are stupidthrowing the shield is also a big pain and the loading is just down right frustrating
especially when you die and want to get right back at a frustrating section but you have to wait for the long loadthe sections when you have to press buttons real quick in the cut scenes go by waaaaaaaay to quick
you mess up about  times until you get it rightstory and graphics are what kept me playing and this is one game where i didnt mind the short lenght to be honestsimply put this is one of the worst titles ive ever had the displeasure of playing
heres my breakdowncombatsadly this is about  of the games content
this fact would sit better with me had combat actually been enjoyable
hs utilizes a lightheavy attack system and allows you to juggle between  attack stances power speed and range
all  have their uses and its imperative to strategize effectively
but combat is such a chore since enemies block your attacks so frequently
even when you land a successful hit it just doesnt feel satisfying enough to make you want to continue your onslaughtscore questspretty linear stuff
the only thing to do aside from fight your way through the main game is to refight through completed levels
why would you
hs rewards combat prowess with glyph points
each time you reach score thresholds you earn medals which unlock more combos
but a huge obstacle to replaying is long loading times
trust methese long load times add up to excruciatingly long waits over a whole gaming sessionscore kai sectionsin certain levels you play as kaia lunaticyoung girl whose sole means of offense is a crossbow
a nice change of paceexcept that the aiming mechanics feel very dated
youll struggle when surrounded
the one upside is the sections that require you to eliminate targets from afar by slowing time and guiding your projectiles
these parts were the most fun i had in this gamescore storyan interesting premise marred by an intolerable protagonist
you play as an undesired daughter who decides to use a forbidden sword to fight for her people but doing so curses her sealing her doom
as i said shes so unlikeable shes only warm towards her sister and otherwise passes as a constantly ruthless warriorand not in a badass wayscore graphicssettingthe graphics are pretty decent for such an old title
the setting is a nice eastern region which feels very appropriate for this gamescore overalla mindnumbingly simplistic game that offers little more than combat in the way of content but the game even fails to deliver in this department
replay of levels is encouraged but youll wade through long load times
all the while youll hate the very character you play asgame score i disagree with most of the negative reviews here that are focused on the controls  i found the controls to be easy to learn and flying the dragon is a lot of funwhat completely ruins this game is the design
the designers appear to be following the rule do not ever ever allow the player to have more than five seconds of fun
the missions are dull and linear often being too hard at the end of  minutes of boring flying from place to place and when you fail one you have to sit there for  seconds while it reloads and you have to do it all over again
but thats not even the worst part
the worst part is that when you finally do slog through whatevers required of you and get to a fun part where youre roasting swiping and eating enemy soldiers like popcorn and generally having a good time the level ends
aaaagh
who the heck are the game designers to tell me i have to stop having fun and start in on one of their boring missions again
i got this game when it first came out and played through about  missions or so before giving up on it
recently i decided to give it another try see if perhaps it would download some update that fixed the worst offenses
nope it still sucks
picture any ps game that you actually enjoy playing  infamous lego star wars force unleashed whatever  and lair is pretty much the exact opposite of it
its very frustrating because in my view the graphics and game mechanics are lovely and innovative
but the game designers should have been fired and their salaries used to pay for some playtesters because in terms of actual gameplay lair is awful
controlling a firebreathing soldiereating dragon ought to be fun but these clowns managed to ruin ityes i wanted it because it was about dragons
yes it looked damn cool in the trailers
yes it got terrible reviews about the gameplay
yes i did not listen and i regret it
i didnt even go past the fourth mission because i was so frustrated with the controls
lair makes you draw your attention from the actual game because you are trying to figure out the game controls
its too sensitive and when you try to do something it makes you do something else
i was really frustrated
not a recommended buy
you have been warned
however the best part of the game and i really mean it
is the music
this game has had one of the most epic and glorious music scored for a video game
if anything get the soundtrack
that is a great investment to your itunes librarya dragonbased flying game similar to drakengard or panzer dragoon lair was touted as the cuttingedge hit for the ps
does it measure upthe story begins in ancient times  a peaceful civilization is wracked by a disaster a giant eruption of volcanoes
the survivors split into two groups the peaceful and knowledgable asylians in the bountiful mountains and the technological mokai on the desolate plains
the mokai attack the asylians hoping to take some of their food so their people dont starve to death
after a few battles it is the hope of both sides that they can come to an agreement but the diviner the spiritual leader of the asylians wishes to continue the conflict
almost from the getgo lair has a hamhanded approach to the story  even before the religious leader is shown to be aggressive and bloodthirsty which occurs pretty early on the characters make blatant outofcharacter antireligious statements
the story has some convoluted twists  the assassination of the peacewanting leaders of each nation in the same meeting by an open agent of the zealotous religious leader leads each side to believe that the other was responsible despite the fact that a member of each side witnessed the meeting and survived but for whatever reason didnt tell anyone
the story is basically there to justify red army fights blue armythe gameplay is probably the worst part of the game
the dragon you ride can breathe fire either as a stream or as individual blasts and is steered using the motion sensor
however the controls do not handle particularly well and tend to be overly sensitive  or not enough
the flight is awkward and the lockon system only works if the enemy is a short distance directly in front of you thus making it annoying and useless in a dogfight
specialized combat sequences include midair melees involving proper button input at close range and a sideswipe subgame when you get close to enemy dragons and ground attacks either strafing from the air or landing on the ground and wading into the battle
the controls on almost all of these are clunky and ineffectual making combat and flight frustrating beyond the limits of funthe graphics are a mixed bag on the one hand the designs and style are fantastic viewable through unlockable concept art most of which is only barely noticaeble in the game such as soldiers armor but on the other hand the overuse of lighting and bloom makes the backgrounds almost impossible to see most of the time
sure its great when you have fantastic vistas architecture and costumes all with a vague hint of a shadow of the colossus style but the combination of the overexposure to light and the awkward jerky controls means that nobody will be able to enjoy them
as mentioned there is a concept art gallery and the game might be worth playing through just to unlock all of it
ingame however it doesnt really seem to matterthe sound is good but has such a feeling of being overdone in almost every single way  the music and voice acting both seem so awkwardly familiar with the same tones and the same musical style as seen in so many other games
its not bad but its just incredibly familiar sounding  in a bad wayas a whole this game has one thing going for it the art
that might be enough in some areas but since this is supposed to be a game not a gallery it doesnt seem particularly forgivablethis game gets a i thought flying dragons around would be fun and it was for about  hours and then i was bored and havent played it for over  years
the game looks good but the flying controls didnt feel natural and the fighting was difficult to master
i play a ton of dungeon stomp rpgs and this just didnt pan outlair was supposed to be one of those ps exclusive games that made buying the expensive system seem like less of an expensive paperweight
sadly though the hyped and lauded lair ends up being supremely disappointing thanks to some overly shoddy controls and shallow gameplay
the first thing youll notice when you fire up lair are the amazing graphics and the almost cinematic camera view style as you pilot your dragon around taking on everything in sight
however what kills lair is what could have made it all the more fun and enjoyable
the sixaxis controler which was utilized so well in the similarly styled warhawk ruins the game
making any kind of quick or tight turns is impossible to pull off and considering there are plenty of narrow flying moments this is inexcusable
not to mention that the control scheme is also quite buggy and glitchy as well
this is particularly worth noting when it comes to targeting enemies and the changeups during the unnecessary overly dramatic slowmotion technique that comes out of nowhere in battle is just annoying
the gameplay itself is disappointing as flying around and obliterating everything in sight gets old pretty quickly and theres little to no replay value once if you finish the game
its sad because the potential here was quite high but alas lair is a surefire disappointment
all in all lair is one of the most disappointing and frustrating games out for the ps right now and while it may be worth a look for some in the end the game is better off being left on the shelfmy problem with lair the first time i played really had nothing to do with the controls i didnt mind them at all and i think the game looked greatto an extent
this game like many other ps exclusives is that it lacks a lot of details because of the lack of graphical power the rsx chip has but relies heavily on the broadband engines  cell processors
my problem is when you hit the ground even with the new patch you get frame rates that drop down to  even down in the teens in small spots wish is horrid considering the pss supposed unlocked potential this makes for a less than enjoyable experience
i love the fact that you can land on the ground burn up chew up and throw the puny little armored men but it slows down and hesitates so much you just want to scream via to many objects on the screen at once
i wish this was able to be fixed but since this is nearly a  year old game i doubt there is anything to help out this glitch
btw the game does look good but watch when you fly around how jagged and sloppy the city details and the water look from above
p anyone
you know what i mean
 this game deserved itit took me a long time to get into this game
the first time i played it i became frustrated trying to move equipment around between characters
the interface is the worst ive ever seen in a video game
once you learn how to work around the shortcomings of the interface youll find an enjoyable and fairly challenging strategy gamethis game is probably strictly for dd players though
you wont find any spell descriptions in the instruction manual youll need to pull out your players handbook which the game stays true to for the most parti recommend this game for dd fans who like strategy rpgsi have been waiting so long for a patch for this game i guess i will have to take it back to amazon and get something else i liked the game it was an old test of dd but it locks up when i fight the  flying angels
every time
i am stuck there and it shuts the machine right off
anyone else do this
there are no scratches
i wonder if the game disk is just bad or is it the game in genral
i never find anyone else online eitheri thought it was a special product for the nintendo wii
but its only an expensive memory storage
just buy a normal oneit crashes way to much to get into
my pc is fairly new and its specs are well past what the game needs
i posted about it on the game site and was told to get used to it and save alot
no thanks on this gamei am a fan of the rainbow six series and this game falls way short
if you want this game get the  version
its a direct port from the  but its very disappointing on the pcgameplay  you play forever in the streets of mexico
this game should be called mexico because you play the first  hours there
controls are basically the same as other games but there is no jumping
what were they thinking
you cant jump over stuff without being pressed against it first
this really took away from gameplay for megraphics  vegas on the  is very impressive but on the pc its not
it sux even with with my gts overclocked
there is no aa option and the game looks very dark
after you get in vegas it looks better but all the mexico stuff just doesnt look gooddont bother getting this game because its not worth the 
get one of the older ones instead
ubisoft laid an egg with this  port am going to be a bit of a contrarian here
for some people this game will be disappointing and i am sorry i bought it
first some of the graphics are pretty good some from st person perspective look like original xbox in fact the only graphics that look current gen are the faces and uniforms everything else looks last gen next complaint the controls cant be customized so some folks may like and some wont but worse the controls are somewhat glitchy try running you cant zig zag or backpedal leading one to killed over and over
the button for jumping over obstacles only work where the designers want you jump so many times you will try jump over a wall and nothing happens leading to another death
also there was no melee or prone that i could find
the designers are also pretty chintzy with grenades with a lot levels with no grenades at allanother annoying feature is if you get killed toward the end of a level you have to restart it which i am one those folks who hate repeating the same level over and overthis game has a lot of graphics glitches too with guns hanging in mid air clipping and some parts the action seemed like i was playing the original wolfensteini think games like the call of duty series make me feel more like it is a real war this game feels to me like paintball or airsoft with a dash of band of brothers cut scenes
people rave about the story but the game has little if no background on what the game is based on operation market garden
i also hated the lighting i know it is supposed to look like holland but it just seemed like an paintball game in marthas vinyard in the summer with the exception of a few scenes there was almost no atmosphere of warin my view this game is slightly better then the budget war games put out by the history channel
the sound was probaly the better part of this game
im just playing through it because i dont want to feel like i wasted my  i got the collectors edition which came with a  inch gi joe type action figure which was ok but kinda of boringthere are a few cool things like the blood head shot slow motions but again there are graphic problems if you shoot into a wall not near any fighting there is no bullet holes some of the enviroment is destrucible and some isnt
the game gets very repetive basically amounting to the same squad tactics just different locations
i played on multiplayer and like some others was not to impressedthats my two cents worth i say rent if before you buy it to see if it is your cup of teathe graphics are fine
the play is goodbut there isnt really any one out there to play it live
the store line is good but the targeting when using the scoop is poor even for the time line it was ini recommend not purchasing this item as a bundle with the new psp slim
amazon should of pointed this out that the new psp slim does not fit snuggly in the case
i have drop this case twice and the psp will fall outi guess theyamazon expect people to buy it then write a review about it
instead of making better quality insurance of the product telling the consumer it does not work well with the new psp slimwhere to startgraphics hideous sound terrible game play buggy
avoid unless u can get it for under a buck
i think i spent  for it and am using it for a coasterafter doing research on this item i found out that it was better to buy one with its own power source
this intercooler is made by a company named nyko which is also sold at best buy
i have heard stories of intercoolers without their own external power source actually burning out game consoles x box
i found one that can be found at eb games  gamestop that is made by a company named pelican that has its own external power source that you turn on  leave on at all times
when the system is turned off or not needed the intercooler goes into standby mode
it cost me  which is  more than this one but what is an additional  dollars as an insurance policy to prolong the life of my  system
well worth the money id say
it clamps onto the console  has matching chrome trim for the gb system  black trim for the gb system
i dont know for sure if these intercoolers are really necessary as i am sure that sony ran heat tests on the ps but i do know that  additional fans that are powered independently that cools the system by  degrees will definitely lengthen the life span of the system
i suggest that you clean the vents of dust frequently too because this system sucks in the air
update to previous reviewi have just read where another reviewer has stated that this intercooler made by nyko would not fry the ps because it is utilizing the power from the system
my argument would be that when sony was designing the ps i am sure that they had the power that runs the system allocated for the existing components that make up the ps
i dont think they designed it with power left over to support an external component that isnt even licensed by them
caveat emptor buyer beware
folks
i have read other reviews  even went to cnet where electronics are tested  they even said that the intercooler that was made by nyko for the xbox was basically a dud
people that bought said that it fried their system  microsoft wouldnt replace the system because the warranty was voided because it was not licensed by themthe above poster said that this intercooler uses the same principle of plugingsic two things into a surge protector
okay a surge protector is not a computer
it has no working components
its a passive devicei would strongly suggest that anyone that decides to buy this product to contact sony to see if by attaching this device to the system will void the warrantyok so this thing does not fit at all on a  gig ps and they are aware of this and there still selling thesethey should atleast print something on the box about it not fitting on a  gb system but they dontbut i still have it on my ps but thats because its not on straight and the little clips broke off even though it wasnt fault because in the directions it says to push until you hear a click or something like thatwell anyway this does work pretty well as far as removing hot air from the systemthats why i gave it a  starbut it doesnt fit right on my gig system
 wonder if theyll send me a redesigned replacement even though the little clips broke offi already had an intec charging cable and thought from the pictures that this one would match it in appearance
unfortunately its pretty lame
it is both flimsy and stiff
it does charge just fine but looks awful as it retains its unattractive folded shape long after being stretched outi am a father who grew up plaing video games and have owned multiple systems both console and portable
based on other reviews i read and the fact that i like garfield and platform games i was really excited to give this one a try
unfortunately my thoughts quickly changed when i started actually playing itfor a ds game i thought the graphics were very good
they are colorful and seem much more detailed than many of the other ds titles ive played
in ways that is really good for this title but also somewhat depressing considering the level of graphics so many other ds titles could have achievedthis game seems in many ways like its meant for a younger audience
there are many arrows that direct you to where you need to go and the minigames seemed very simple in concept jump on the spiders or jump on the garbage cans avoid the bombs that come out and get an extra life
but thats where the irony comes in
for a game that seemed targeted towards younger game players i thought the difficulty level was pretty high at times
the thing is the difficulty isnt in areas you would expect but rather the outrageous number of cheap shots you take from enemiesdangers that moveflycrawlspring up or shoot you from out of nowhere many of which you simply dont see until you take a halfblind leap onto a nearby platform fall from a ledge or jump somewhere trying to avoid another danger
i was really amazed at the number of cheap shots i was taking as i moved through levels
whether it was a spiked bomb that suddenly appeared from offscreen as i jumped to reach a ledge or a snowball that got thrown at me as i was trying to figure out the pattern of a danger i needed to avoid or an unseen spike that shot up from the ground on a platform i had to jump to
at times it felt like someone meticulously calculated how best to take away hit points and lives for the player knowing they would jump here to avoid something flying at you and purposely putting something else dangerous there that would be right in sync timewise to hurt you
throughout the game i constantly felt like i never had enough hit points or lives and was forced to start some whole worlds over repeatedly
im starting to wonder if this is simply how this game was designed as a way to try and build in longer playing time for anyone who wants to complete itsadly some of my biggest frustration seemed to come in during the bonus levels
you knowthe levels that are really hard to find and usually require you to sacrifice a lot of hit points and lives to reach because the paths to them are full of danger and enemies
i realized over time that part of the reason i was having to replay whole lands over again due to losing all my lives was this cheap shot mentality that even carried over into the bonus rounds
without the bonus rounds to rack up extra lives you have to survive  levels including a boss with only  lives basicallt  hit points
i suppose this is easy enough if you want to go very slowly through the game and sit and wait on every platform ready to jump because you dont know what might suddenly appear around you from off screen
i was amazed at the number of times i reached a bonus round though my character appeared on screen and before i could even move was touched by a spider or something and was instantly killed
so much for the bonus round the liveshit points i lost trying to reach it etc thus i was actually worse off overall by trying to reach the bonus round than if i had just skipped it altogetherthe real problem with this entire game is that the visual space is simply way too cramped
it makes for a nice large and pretty garfield but it also means you are constantly blindsided by things you cant see because the field of vision is way too narrow
i also thought the hit detection on many of the enemies was very poor
whether jumping on ghosts birds snowmen etci was amazed at the number of times i should have defeated an enemy but instead somehow lost one of my few hit points or even lives because jumping on their head wasnt good enough
it was aas if i needed to pinpiont land on one specific pixel that the game randomly decided for each enemy and had apparently chosen the wrong one this time
it was grossly inconsistent and left me scratching my head
in the end i thought the game overall was highly restrictive and punishing in this regard having an extremely difficult challenge that made you just want to skip trying to jump on enemies after awhile and forget the coins you could have had from destroying them
the funny thing was i didnt realize until the end that you dont get anything for all the coins you collect
you just need a certain number to open the bonus round doors but i think the highest number of coins ever needed was  or  and you can commonly pick up that many just laying around in each level so there really was no point to ever take on any of the enemies at least for their coins anyhowi really like platform games and have played through many of them on various systems
i have experienced many that were challenging but garfields nightmare turned out to simply be a nightmare in cheap shot gameplay
in the end my time with this game was more frustration that enjoyment and i would not recommend this game to anyonei reached the final boss at about  hours of gameplay time and lost  lives trying to defeat him
after losing my last life and being told i would have to play the entire world all five levels all over again i decided i was simply done with this onemy  year old son wanted to buy this game but we rented it first and im glad that we did
this game isnt that great and gets boring fast
each level is long and takes a while to get through
in each level youre assinged different tasks to complete
without my help my son wouldnt be able to complete each level
after an hour of playing this game my son was ready to take it back to the video store
if youre still thinking about buy this game rent it firstmy biggest gripe is the rd person over the shoulder view
may as well have made it an fps
but then i guess you wouldnt see the dude transform
wasnt a big fan of gow so maybe thats why i wasnt impressed
incredible graphics
i just didnt like the control at all
a true rd person adventure is uncharted
after playing through that game it sets the standard
non of this over the shoulder stuff does it for me
coming off uncharted to this one i was just disappointed
dark sectors story is boringdont even spend the money renting the game
download the demo off psn
its only about  minutes of play but that should be enough to make a decisionthis is game is ok  its not as fun as the other reviewers say it is
the glaive is pretty weak as a weapon
the level designs are nice and the graphics are ok  i would not really recommend this game
if you are looking for a much better game i would highly recommend uncharted drakes fortune
i am a little disappointed with dark sectorneed to start off by saying
rent before you buy
i was so excited for this game to come out and received a  off coupon from amazon for being such a game crackhead
what could possibly go wrong and the answer to that is oh so muchthe game starts off good with some nice water effects
then enters hayden which by my standards looks like a complete tool
how in the world did creative ok this character model
as we all know hayden then becomes infected which might make the game awesome but sadly it doesnt
the glaive is incredibly weak and has such a short range of attack
hayden would have been better off with a mutated arm that shot orange nerf ballsa few more things set this game back
crappy models and textures being a big deal
extremely dark areas prevent you from going any further until you blindly stumble onto a pitch black web wall
and my biggest gripe
the worst ai i have ever witnessed
dont get me wrong resident evils waves of zombies are great but dark sectors zombies just become stupidly annoyingagain rent before you buy or just plain avoidi am surprised this game gets the decent reviews it does
the good first great graphics
the game looks stunning for what it is
it controls fairly good as well
however that is where it ends
the gameplay is utterly frustrating it takes forever to beat waves of enemies and even after you get the aftertouch for the glaive it is still an inefficient weapon
the story is essentially incoherent
there are random zombies
no explanation is given as to why zombies suddenly appear
its as though the developers said lets throw some zombies into the game just to spice it up and lets make them really annoying i gave dark sector a good  hours and just said screw it
skip this if you dont like frustrating gameseven though the game is cheap i dont recommend it especially if youve just finished mgs  its completely dissapointing frustrating and quite boringthe good graphicsthe bad boring horrible controls nonsense story annoying enemies the glaive is cool the first times but gets boring and sometime useless horrible close quarters combat
i stopped at the middle of chapter  and dont intent to continue moved on to bioshock gladlybut thats just my opinion aparently some people like it so download the demo and just try for yourselfthis game started out great and looked so promising after about an hour youll find out just how right i am
the actual upgrades in the game are unimpressive you would expect something cool to happen like longer range splitting into more
but nothing its repeditive and is old after  hours
the only real pluses to this game is its a okay shooter with some delimbing
but really theres better games for your money
this game looked so good early on but the end was obviously unfinished and unpolisheddark sectors mediocre graphics and paltry story can be overlooked for its concise linear gameplay and engaging combat
while the game can be completed in under  hours youll find yourself eagerly awaiting each new ability and enjoying using those abilities in combatthere is little to no replay value in this game however so its a good thing that the price point has fallen so lowdefinitely worth one playthrough though in my opinionthis is not an enjoyable game
it rarely rises to the level of funthe movement and cover system is similar to gears of war but id say it doesnt work as well in dark sector as it does in gowthere isnt much of a storyyour main weapon is a glaive which is thrown and sometimes guided
many tasks are impossible without learning to control the glaive
i used the glaive almost exclusively and never came to appreciate it especially when you have to guide it
towards the end i cant even explain how tired and bored i was of using the thingthe boss fights have a similar feel to gow in that some are almost trivial once you look up what to do
the final boss fight is as worthless and annoying as any i can think ofthe main flaw about this game is that if you decide to quit in the middle of a chapter even though it says saving during parts of a chapter and later when you load your game ready to play again expecting to be at that point you quit at last time it doesnt happen
you have to start the whole chapetr all over again
i have to agree with another reviewer this game is pretty repeative all the enemies do the same thing
i got bored with this game quick
maybe this is worth a rental but definately not worth spending your hard earned i have to agree with the reviewer mystery maven
i have played many adventure games and scratches has to be one of the most boring ever
the first day of this game is painfully boring
its like torture with nothing happening
its just searching through rooms in a dull house examining everything again and again opening every drawer in the house placing a few phone calls mailing a letteretc
i had to force myself to stay interested and keep going
its hard to stay awake playing this game
yes it picks up a little on the second day but the first day is so excruciatingly dull that by the time the second day finally rolled around i was not into it anymore
the first day is really that bad
it ruins the game for meyou also have to do certain things to trigger the game so you can continue like searching every inch of the house looking for candles before you are allowed to make a phone call to progress
also each of the many doors that you open has a cutscene and sometimes these cutscenes will get stuck
i had the game freeze up during some of these and i had to control alt delete and restart the game
you will also be opening the same doors over and over and over again
this gets old after a whilei just got through playing one of the best adventure games ever darkness within in pursuit of loath nolder
scratches seriously pales in comparisonlike other gamers i really wanted to like this game
i love adventure games especially the spooky kind and the challenge and slow pace of them is something i relish
but this game made so many obnoxious design mistakes i gave up halfway through and used a walkthrough just to see what would happen
things that in my book are unforgiveable design sins red herrings
its very annoying to have the game point something out to you especially something that looks like it should open or move or otherwise function and then never enable you to do anything with it
if youre like me you waste a ton of time revisiting it trying in vain to make it do something
ignoring established game logic
early on in a game you figure out the logic of the game world  what sorts of things are interactive which arent how you can move etc
when a designer changes these rules late in the game it creates confusion
this example is the annoying flip side of the above issue
im thinking here of a specific instance in the game wherein i tried to interact with something no less than  times with no result
the player voiceover even said something along the lines of i dont ever want to have anything to do with that
being totally stuck later on in the game i looked for a hint and the hint was to  you guessed it  interact with the thing that up till then had done nothing
ignoring common sense
all i can say here is who the hell willingly climbs into a crematoriumsized furnace
or if a person is investigating a mystery and finds a trove of informational papers but is only allowed to read one of them would she think its possible to come back and read more later
see game world logic ignoring established player motivation having had the player character insist multiple times that he refused to leave the house until the mystery was solved a puzzle solution shouldnt then be contingent upon him leaving
and lastlypersnicketyredundant puzzle solutions
if you already have a rag in your inventory you shouldnt have to find an equivalent but different rag to complete a puzzlethe designers often seemed not to take the time to consider what they to might actually do in the situation and instead invented contrived circumstantial puzzles that were just irritating to figure out
all told this game was an exercise in frustration and i was severely disappointedi purchased this bag to keep my wii games and nunchucks in
i wanted an attractive bag in my family room next to my wii
i realize that is not the intended purpose of this bag
it is so small that with my  games in plastic cases and two nunchucks it barely closes
the cardboard cased links crossbow and wii sports fit in the front pocket
instruction manuals dont fit
hoped my extra two guest wimotes would fit
no chancethe quality of the bag is fine
it looks nice
for the prices charged on wii goods give us some value
i wish i went i went to the local bowling alley and purchased a childs bowling bag to keep my wii accessories in
they are  larger and more attractivethe bag is not large enough for its intended purpose
i usually give high ratings
see my reviews
not on this minii got this game the first day it came out
i have been playing the sims ever since the st sims game
its really not worth the  dollar price tag for only  stories
after you are finshed with the stories you then get to play in classic mode witch is just the same as the oringal sims
if i were you i would save my money and just go buy seasons when it come out later this monthi like the idea of this type of game on the ds i spent many hours on adventure games on the pc in the s
but most of the time on this game you are clicking to go thru the dialogue there are some puzzle solving involved but they are pretty simple
also a lot of the time you need to go to random places to advance the story example spoiler alert at ch  you know you are supposed to return a doll to the little girl but when you go to her room the door doesnt open well thats because you are supposed to solve this other unrelated puzzle first the fountain pen to advance the story then you can go talk to the girl which makes absolutely no sense
i am at chapter  and think im donei read some great reviews on this game one even came from my favorite nonbiased electronic gaming magazine
played it from start to finish and well i just expected so much more
my biggest beef was the extremely long dialogues
play this game if you like the idea of walking around in a small hotel talking to people over and over and over and overas several other reviewers have pointed out the game part of this package essentially costs you 
the other  goes toward a wii remote and if you look at it that way i guess these games dont seem like such a waste
unlike wii sports which i think is actually a lot of fun these simple games seem to be more gimmicks than anything and aimed purely at showcasing the wii remotethere are several games herefind the mii a ping pong game a fishing game etcbut i was bored by the time id played them all through once
id say the shooting game was the most fun for methe ping pong had the potential but the controls were a bit awkward and even once i got the hang of it i couldnt find anyone who wanted to play that could control the darn thing well
the tank game is okay the fishing game is okay the pool game feels awkward with the way you move the remotei could go on but the point here is that these games just arent that much fun
even with the few amusing minutes i had when i first put the game in ive found the replay value here to be pretty low and havent played the game since that first timenow the big question is it worth the money
well if i had it to do over again id just buy the wii remote and save the  bucks but i guess if youre looking for some simple games that let you use the wii remote in various ways this game might provide that
just dont expect great amounts of entertainmentafter playing sports resort where the games are a lot more fun and graphics more presentable wii play just isnt up to par
i bought this because i needed another remote and since a remote costs  nintendo or  nyko i guess to pay a little more for a remote  game may be a better deal
like many other reviewers have said its like a buying a remote for  and  for the gamehowever not all the games are bad
i like the pool game
the shooting game is simple but passable
the cow game is also fun but pretty much for young kids
the tank game is ok the rest is just plain sillyso if you need another remote go ahead and get this
otherwise pass on the games
better off getting sports resorti would not recommend this game to anyone
if you have a wii then you most likely have wii sports
thats all you really need for wiimii fun
only about  games in the bunch are playable in wii play let alone fun and the fun ones lose their luster within five minutes
you want a lot of shallow minigames done right
get warioware for the same price
the games are just as deep but there are over  of them
with that game you dont need the extra controller to play with friends
its just that wii play games are so increadably shallow and quick that you will see all there is to offer in less then an hour
the only game that might keep your attention longer than that is tanks but even that loses fun after an afternoon
the only reason this gets two stars is that it comes with a controller but honestly you are better off just buying a controller and passing on the game and saving your  for a movie or something that will keep your interest longer then  minutes
i know  dollars sounds like a little but if someone comes up to you with a steaming pile of fresh softserve dog droppings and says its only five dollars when the rest of the doodoo he sells is  would you buy it just because it is a deal
nobody needs this game therefore nobody should buy it just because it is cheapa remote is a remote but the wii play game is so bad that i would not drop  on it again
get a  wiimote and save the  for a better game like a cheap wario or rayman game
wii sport is x as good as this  set of games
while the physic isnt bad the execution is lame and you lose interest within a hoursave your  and just get a remote by itselfi wish i would have looked this one up first
just get the remote dont bother with the games
they are really lame
you also have to play each of them
if you try to play one you have to play the ones before it to unlock all of them
supposedly it is trying to help you learn to use the remote better
honestly all it did was frustrate meok awesome having another control
now about we play
its a terrible game the pool is nice but all games could be better
this game is more ment like a tutorial for people to learn how the controls on the wii works so i think this should come along with wii sports on the console packit wasnt that much more for the game and the controller so we bought the gamecontroller pack
wii play is really hard to play and control and doesnt have very fun gamesi got this a while ago so i would have four remotes
i thought it would be a good deal because its only ten dollars more than a remote
but i should have just bought a remote because the game that comes with it is not very good
its only mini games that is not even worth eight bucks
it does not even save it after u beat it
u have to beat it over and over again which it is kind of a hard game so its gets really boring
even on multiplayer
the only good thing about this is the remote that comes with itwe only bought this because at the time it was the same price for the wii remote as it was to get the wii remote with wii play
i was stunned at how terrible the games were and my expectations were not high to begin with after reading the other reviews
for example comparing wii sports tennis to wii play table tennis is night and day
the wii sports tennis actually requires you to swing your arm you can do a backhand stroke and real effort is required
wii play table tennis on the other hand just requires that you slightly move the remote left or right to hit the ball
there are not actual swings and often your movements wont register or wont register accurately
i found this to be consistently a problem throughout all of the games in wii play
my eight year old daughter does enjoy the fishing game but the rest of them just didnt get played after a couple of days because they really are that badi did give it three stars though because the game included awii remote controllerand that was our primary reason for purchase
thewii nunchuk controller  white is not included with thisi absolutely despise this game
whats the point
at least wii sports has normal controls
the controls on this are terrible
a couple of the games are completely for toddlers
the other games like ping pong is ridiculous the controls on it are terrible and the pool is idiotic w terrible controls also
just for the heck of it we tried every game so i know im being fair right now and we decided that were never again putting this disc into my wii there is no point
if you have normal games like mario  sonic at the olympics w good graphics good controls and a lot of depth why waste your time on thisi have this  stars because it comes w the extra remote
i suggest you buy the remote wo this wii play nonsense
also dont fall for the tricks of sellers everywhere who are writing  games no no no  games on wii sports disc that comes standard w the console and  crappy mini games on this wii play
everything about this game pissed me off the controls and graphics and the games are not at all engaging and you never want to play them again
unless of course youre a super casual gamer who doesnt care for playing a real game
get winter sports or mario  sonic at the olympics those are real games that you and friends will have fun withoverall they just wanted to price the remote a little bit more so they stuck this little disc in so youd pay an extra  bucks for it
not worth it
i wouldnt even pay a dollar for this gamewii play is a pretty big disappointment especially considering how much fun wii sports is
skip this game and get wii sports resort instead
wii sports resort is at least as fun as wii sports and both wii sports and wii sports resort are so much better than wii playbustamove bash
for the wii takes a classic bubblebursting arcade game and brings it to the wii
how much you love it depends how hooked you are to this style of gameplayif youve played games on any platform youve probably come across this style of gameplay
it is found everywhere
there are rows of colored bubbles on the top of the screen
you have a bubble launcher on the bottom part of the screen
your aim is to get three or more bubbles of the same color to touch
if you do all of those bubbles will fall down
over time you clear the screen of all bubbles if youre good enoughi think part of my issue is that ive played this game so many times on so many different platforms  and in many cases it is done far better than it is presented herethe sound is annoying
it is a highpace electronic kind of song which gets annoying very quickly
even kids must wear down after hearing this too many times
im not sure anybody could find this enjoyableim a fan of the wiimote and use it on many games
here it gets frustrating
youre trying to arrange a bank shot off a wall and it just doesnt go properly
this game is all about making those angles work
when the controller gets in the way its not funthe backgrounds and menus are subpar
so many other wii games do amazing jobs with the menus and graphics
here they are simple and cheezy
they dont even have to be special
they just have to be professional looking and they are notadd in flying saucers which zoom across your screen to distract you and not a lot of variety in the game play and im just not connecting with this one
again its not that i mind the premise
i own several bubble style puzzle games and enjoy them as well as tetris
i like strategy games
i like that theyre good for all ages
but the implementation of this one is just not up to standardsso absolutely if you love this style of game i recommend you get yourself a copy of another version of it
this one here is not nearly the best option availablei purchased this game with my own funds for the purpose of doing this reviewthis game looks like a multiplayer version of snood made by a japanese developer
if you are looking for multiplayer action then look for something elsepros i guess the music would be the only thing that would be a pro would be the music but even that didnt catch my attentioncons this game doesnt really have any depth
the japanese visual effects are not very pleasing and give it a very cheesy look
the multiplayer leaves nothing to be excited about since it has only one moderesult if you want a multiplayer party game you are still going to have to get games like warioware and mario party i decided to pick up the wiis bustamove bash heres a quick review of the pros and cons
it offers some new control layouts thanks to the wiimote
most importantly the controls work well and enhance the gameplay
the gameplay is the usual bustamove goodness with some added flying saucers that offer special powers pretty cool stuff
if you dont know the bustamove formula its an action puzzle game like tetris where you shoot different colored bubbles upward trying to connect  or more to make them disappear
its been around for a long time and thats because its genuinely fun
but what im noticing in bustamove bash is how bare and empty this game feels
even the main menu will give you an empty feeling inside ive seen cooler menus on the nes
but the menus dont matter its the lack of depth to the game modes which is hurting this title
there are less then a handful of modes the regular puzzle mode which has tons of stages so thats a plus
endless mode is exactly what it sounds like and its always fun
shooting mode is a super simple shooting gallery game it really isnt very good especially compared to the shooting games on wiiplay wariowarez super paper mario all of which are vastly more enjoyable
multiplayer is fun but there really arent many options to change the experience
except for being able to determine how long youll play against your friends you cant really change or tweak anything so youre left with the same experience over and over
the mutiplayer is enjoyable dont get me wrong its just a bit too shallow though
you wouldve thought the developer could have easily added a couple extra modes but apparently they didnt have the spare week it would have taken them
basically to sum it up this game is good but its shallow
if youre a bustamove fan or you want another casual game to add to your growing wii collection then go out and buy this
this is a perfect title for the wii because it will really appeal to the nongamers out there
for more avid gamers youre probably better off waiting for this game to drop in price which im sure will happen by years endpresentation  if you get a  out of  on a test then your parents should spank you
this presentation pretty much sucksgraphics  the graphics are fine considering this is bustamove expect simplicity and you wont be disappointedsound  the music is pretty annoying but i tend to think that about most games
may appeal to very young gamersgameplay  im gonna add a little extra umph to my gameplay score because this really is an enjoyable experience especially with the wiimote
good for nongamers toolasting appeal  the gameplay itself has lots of lasting appeal simply because its bustamove
but where we should have tons of modes and options instead we have a nearly empty desertoverall score  i would especially recommend this title for nongamers children and seniorsi was looking forward to getting this game is it utilizes the wii controller wonderfully but the controls are so flawed its hard to have funthe idea of the game was a great one but the controls are tedious  frustrating
half of the time the game doesnt even respond to my commands
also before you start a round theres a few words on the screen that tell you what motions youll need to use  what buttons to press  too bad that arent very thorough
there are times when you need to hold a button down and it doesnt tell you that or youre just left blank because there are multiple steps  the you werent prepared for and dont how to completeon the other hand my cousin  years old loves the game
she didnt seem the least bit annoyed that the game didnt always respondmultiplayer is amusing and redeems this game but not by much
this game could have been great if it had taken a lesson from diner dash
imagine trying to keep track of several dishes cooking at once  now that would be funultimately im glad i bought this used on ebay  now i know why the person sold it
my advice rent it firstwhat a snoozer
its the same repeative motions throughout the game
you peel a couple of vegetables then chop them then fry them with a shake of the wiimote
and for the challenge segment you touch the salt shaker wait a few seconds twist the wiimote wait a few seconds turn the wiimote wait a few seconds click on a leek wait a few seconds twist the wiimotei think you get the ideaon a scale of   terrible and   greatest game ever as a game its a  out of  as a cooking tutorial its an  out of 
the music is the same rehash garbage from every other cutesy japanese game
but what astounds me is cooking mamas voice sounds a japanese girl trying to speak english with a german accent
it amazes me how well she pulls that sound off i sure hope it was intentionalwhen i say pass on this game i mean pass it through the window into the outside garbage can
it will stink up your kitchen if you throw it away insidelike wario this is a boring one sided game
basically its all about using the wii remote
alot of cutting splitting and moving around but theres no real plot to it
head to head combat is very boring too
no satisfication what so ever
unless you want this game for waving around the remote stay away from cookin mama and wario smooth movesthis game i found to be extremley boring
the graphics were horrible it was extremely repetitive and the only thing that changes throughout the game play is they add more recipies
it is extremely putsy and pointless
i do think this game would be very fun however for little kids because it would be simple enough for them and when girls are little they tend to like to do things like thative only played this game in singleplayer mode and it is very boring
i heard it is better with multiplayer ill try it and hopefully it will redeem any aspect of this game
you just go through cooking recipes it looks like its going to be fun but i just found it boring
i finished order up before starting this and that was an extremely fun cooking game
this pales in comparison
play it instead if you get the chance although it doesnt have multiplayeri enjoyed bothprince of persia sands of time for xbox andprince of persia  warrior withinon my xbox and i was excited to see what the wiis innovative controller would bring to the franchise
i was disappointedthe game play was largely similar to the previous games except for the implementation of stealth kills which are for the most part a tedious addition
moreover the controls are overly simplified and while you do swing the remote their is no comparison between how you swing and how the prince swings
overall the game came across as a quick port in a slightly tired concept
i still think that there is a lot of potential in the prince of persia franchise and i will rent the next game in the series in the hopes that it improves
until then i will wait patiently for someone to create a sword fighting game that does the wii justice
ninja gaiden anyoneim gonna have to disagree with lisa shea
this game blows
this is coming from someone who has never really played any of the prince of persia franchises
if your idea of fun is jumping and hanging from ledges by all means this is your game
i will however give it up for the controls which are pretty responsive and intuitive
try zelda or godfather for a better timei played through this game of the pc the two thrones and wanted to give it another go so buying the wii version was a nobrainer for meim not as irritated by flicking the remote or nunchuck as some people are but i found myself having problems with the camera and the responsiveness of these controls in particular
i never made it past the second level which is a real shamei bought this game for nostalgia more than anything else
i used to read jump growing up in japan and couldnt pass up a fighting game that includes so many of the characters i grew up withhowever the game itself is a bore
i loved smash brothers so i was expecting similar polish
not so much
the game is flatout boringi am very happy amazon has such a great return policy because if they didnt this would have been a wonderful way to waste  bucks
this controller feels very nice in your hands but it just doesnt work
the control sticks are not responsive at all and games like call of duty  are pretty much impossible to play with it
the x button also works about  of the time
it generally took me about  presses of the button before i would actually jump
the r and l buttons are also not very good as you have to push them all the way down before they work
this controller feels amazing in your hands and it also looks nice and comes with a long recharging cord but it is a piece of junk
if you are looking for a new ps controller get the dualshock   you can order them online now which is an import from japan but works without any problems with american consolesi own one or just wait until you can buy them in stores
i really wish this controller worked better because if it werent for the control sticks x button and trigger buttons this controller would be pretty goodthis was my dream come true for the playstation a controller not designed to fit a five foot three japanese guy
it looks pretty cool and feels a lot like a  controller with more grip my excitement shrouded my better thinking until the day came when i put myself out of my misery and destroyed itunacceptable terrible qualities of this controller the rechargeable battery wouldnt so i had to use aa
you have to occupy a usb port while using this controller
i coulndt sync to the ps with out the usb plug
the sticks are unsensitive to the point where aiming is improbable  either sluggish movement or all the way fast
the buttons epecially r l stick on the regular but that can be fixed with sparse amounts of oilso this thing felt great but sucked big time
pretty much worthless considering you can get a generic wired ps controller for around ten buckswe bought this about a week after we got our wii last april
i refuse to use batteries we just throw in the garbage and this seemed like one of the only options for a charging station for the wiimotes
i got it at a good price here in amazon and was looking forward to being able to just put the wiimotes on the base and have them chargedyou have to take the regular back off the wiimote and put on the one that comes with the charger station it has a little metal plate so it allows the wiimote to connect to the station and charge
you just sit in down in the base
but if you have your little jelly things on the wiimote you have to peel it back and then put it in the chargerthen you have to get it to connect and this is where we get supremely annoyed
the light means that its connected and charging
you put one in get it to light put the other one in and in the process of getting that light to be on the other one goes out
its a pain in the neck to get it with both lights lit up
its blue while its charging and turns green when its done
if it werent for this annoying thing of not getting them both lit at the same time id be giving it five stars as this is a green product because it enables the use of rechargable batteriesla idea era ahorrarme un dinero en el uso de los controles del wii
pero resulta que las bateriacuteas recargables no duraron mucho se dantildearon y conseguir el repuesto genera un sobre costo
termine comprando pilas aa recargables que se consiguen en todos lados y hasta ahora no he tenido que botar a la basura ninguna de esas pilas
considero que con esta unidad he mal gastado un dinero ya que la base de carga quedo para botarla a la basura y los moacutedulos de carga nada se puede hacer con ellos por que ya no quieren recibir recargai got this quite some time ago and was wondering why the charger packs were not charging while it was plugged in and the remotes in exact position
there was some problems with some of these chargers that did not charge due to some defect where the little button thing on the station that presses against the charger didnt always make contact with the remote which seemed to be my casei dumped it and simply rely on regular brand name rechargable batteries and my duracell aaaaa  battery charger instead as i did before i purchased this
i only did buy the charger to see if it would have been more convenient but it was more of a hassle to meread up on reviews and stuff before switching from a normal battery charger before buying this because it may be more trouble than it should bethe unit does work however many times i have found that sometimes the unit loses its connection and the battery is dead next time you want to use it
other times it works fine
should be redesigned to hold the unit more securely while chargingpros  wiimote is always ready to play with a full charge  design blends in to the wiimote perfectly so you dont feel itcons  you have to wiggle them when you put them back int the charger to make the contacts line up  minor inconvenience  based on where the charge contacts are and the need to place in a cradle you can not use the rubber jacketsthis product is very unreliable
it takes some jiggling around of the wiimote in the charger to get the im charging light to come on
when the light comes on sometimes it goes green charged almost immediately
swapping controllers in different positions sometimes rectifies this problem but sometimes it doesnt make any difference
when you can get it to charge the battery life is great which is the only reason for giving this product a  star review instead of  also they might have been able to put the charging contacts in a different place as they seem to get a little corroded from hand sweat and grime due to intense game play
disposable batteries are not the answer but i would seek other options before buying this productthis charge station is a nice effort but functions poorly
the controlers do not seat in the charger well
you have to jiggle them and press them into position juuuuuust right for them to chargeoften that doesnt work eithergiven the same challenge i would buy more rechargeable batteries and forget the concept of third party battery packsproscomes with  batteries and two chargerssmall and easy to usebetter then other charge stations out there right now for wii friend has tried others that are more finickyconscontroller has to sit in charge station in order to charge battery so that controller is out of commission
ideally  i would like to be able to disconnect battery plug into charger and swap new ones in to continue playingdoesnt always connect properly to charger but the charger will still show that its charging
there have been a couple times were i would charge it for a couple of hours pull it off and it is still deadverdictworth getting until something better comes out
i also have the quick charge kit for the xbox and it is  times better then this kit quick charge kit is quicker to charge longer life charges without controller attached always connects
if  nintendo released their own kit or someone releases a better one like the quick charge kit i would throw this one away and buy the newi have a projector instead of a television so all my wires consoles etc are concentrated behind the couch
this obviously caused some problems when i tried to run the oem sensor bar which doesnt actually sense anything from behind the couch to the front wall
so instead of that hassle i got this guy and put some sticky velcro on the wall where i wanted it to stay
it worked great at first even though the works from up to  feet away claim is a pure load of craptry ft but after about a week it stopped registering a solid signal from very far away
now im here having bought it about a month ago and ive gotta be standing  feet away from the wall if i want to point at anything on the screen otherwise the signal on the wiiremote flickers like a strobe light which anyone whos played the thing knows is downright useless
honestly i wish id invested in an extension cable for the oem sensor bar since i can only assume the range on the wireless one will continue to get worse and worse as the batteries drainthere isnt much to say other then it simply didnt turn on
i tried  sets of new batteries and couldnt get the bar to power up
dead on arrival edit i increased my rating from  to  stars
reason being i found out what is wrong and can work around it
the power activity led bulb is bad
this can be remedied by replacing it
also it doesnt stop the sensor from working
in truth it works flawlessly
im only giving it  because most people wouldnt think to or know how to check this
even more wouldnt know how to replace the bulb and you shouldnt have to
defective is defective
ill work around the issue because to me  its worth the hassle returningreplacing itafter swapping in the nyko wireless sensor bar my wii cursor becomes choppy and tends to jump all over the screen
its no help adjusting the remote sensitivity in wii settings  i couldnt get the two flashing dots at any sensitivity level
i had to swap back the wired wii sensor barperhaps ive received a defective unit
ive contacted nyko support by email and has yet to heard backthe two stars i give are for the its good looks and the ease of use
i would have given this a  star if only i could get it to workthe voiceovers are completely unfaithful to the originals
changes to the challenges didnt add anything i found the carpet balloon racing way too gimmicky
difficulty was so easy that i didnt have to try hard to beat any level
everybody on the online mode use tt as he is the god character so every other character is virtually pointless
i wish they wouldnt do thatso they had a chance at a remake but it feels they only made changes just because they could
i didnt feel any nostalgiain two words repetitive and boring
the gaming repeats  or  actions all the time without any evolution happening
u got a new ship and well u keep dominating the word as before
the game is really boring and the attempts to introduce some variation dancing with the governors daughter or searching for thesaurus inland just bring more repetition to the game
the graphics are really bad too without any kind of inovation
if u love pirates well there are no many other options for psp but maybe u should save the money for the next movie
this game is just going to make the time of waiting jonhhy deep longersaw accolades and recommendations for this game so i bought it
did not live up to the hype
graphics are something out of an early s pc game controls are simplistic and after you spend a few hours figuring out the game everything is supereasy
circle around for shiptoship and ram the other guy to fight the captain using the xbutton and rapier to push him back
take ships sell stuff sign on more crew dance sometimes thats about it
some away missions on islands and primitive land combat not srpglevel
this remake of a hit game is not actually a good gamerecommendation  if buying dont buy the psp versioni thought this would be an exact port but many of the game play elements are far less polished than the pc game
i really enjoyed the pc version but this one was a struggle to like
only play this one if you dont have a pci bought this game based on all the good reviews it received so after playing it i felt obliged to write one of my own so other people like me dont make the same mistakethe graphics and music are fine
not mind blowing but still respectable for a pspmy serious problem with this game is how little there is of it
after about an hour or two to learn the ropes i quickly amped the game all the way up to its hardest levelthe ship to ship combat is remarkably shallow and easy
you basically sail in circles and shoot at the other ship
you give and take little enough damage that conventional sailing ship tactics really play no part excepting that you want to try and broadside the other ship while keeping away from their sidesthe dueling mode is if anything even easier and an easy out to actually having to fight ship to ship battles
i fought around  duels most of them on the hardest difficulty and only lost twice
if you win the duel you get their ship periodtreasure hunting mode is mind numbingly easy as well look at the map navigate there while retaining at least one digger
once you understand what youre supposed to do this is impossible to fail atthe only mode even slightly engaging is the land combat which is basically an extremely dumbed down version of field commander
the only reason its more entertaining than the rest of the game is that you often face far greater numbers who have more firearms than yourselfoverall this game is a complete waste of money
i played for ten hours and felt i had done everything there was to do in the game
the fact that it seems promising when you first start playing doesnt take away from the disappointment that is soon to follow as you wonder to yourself is this itthis game is a media darling but i couldnt help but feel like the gameplay and the graphics were old and outdated
the game seemed like something i would play on a pc in the mid s
i know its a remake of an older game but i would have liked to have seen some more modern gameplay elementsafter a couple weeks the joystick inputs stopped working correctly when you moved the joystick the computer received short bursts of input instead of a constant signal i sent it in for service and they sent me a standard x back not a x proive owned this coolflashy looking thing for a year until now more than  buttons the rudder and the mouse stick arent working
 buttons were deadonarrival and the rest are broken down within time just look for somthing better than thisi was so happy when i heard about mario party  but i was so dissapointed when i played it
there are so many things wrong with this gamefirst of all this game should have been released for the gamecube not wii
as a matter of fact the whole game looks like it was completed for gamecube then quickly converted to wii
lets take when characters shop
the yes and no options are at the bottom of screen
so usually when you point the controller so far down the sensor bar looses contact with the control so you have the reaim the control several times
this was the design of the previos gamecube games but then you could just steer the controlstick and hit a here you have to aim and choose
this is annoying and frustrating why couldnt they move the yes or no to the middle of the screen
i mean when you choose what you want to buy you have three things on the middle of the screen
then when youve chosen what you want to buy the options move to the bottom of the screen again  to ask you are you sure you want to buy this
 argh
this was the design of mario party  and  so its obvious this game was done for gamecube first then quickly converted
the same problem occours when that character with the hat asks if you want to hear a secret about the board you play you have to aim for nothe minigames also suffers from the quick conversion
a lot of the minigames you just turn the control to the side use the plus for steering and  to kickhit and  to jump
this is wii youd expect to use the control like in other wii games not pretend the control is a gamecube control
and those games that use this control are so boring
other games where you are supposed to steer you tilt the controller either left or right
and some other games you turn the control while its up from side to side
why does the controls have to change so much
sometimes its difficult to get contact with the sensor bar even when you hold the control like youre supposed to
take the game with the chimps the game tells you to steer left or right to move the monkey
the game responds so bad whether you move the control fast or slow the chimp takes  seconds to respond
bad conversionthere are a very few games which really feel like you play on wii like the shaking soda can minigame or the clean chomp game
theres also a game where you should do  different things  saw hammer and paint a wall
these games are easy and may seem boring but they are funniest because you get to do something with the wii remote it feels like you are really playing
but believe me the boring minigames are overload and they are regurlarly chosen instead of the fun minigames
i also felt the battle minigames were all boring one game is impossible to be the only winner because theres a limit on how much points you can get
and i hate the cutting ropes game
its totally random and ive never won itit gets worse
in previous mario party games especially in the first mario party the easy computer players were so bad you were laughing at how badly they played certain games
i remember in the first game i was laughing so hard watching luigi play a memory game he would run to the correct place but then change direction and go to another place then another and another and choose wrong
talk about stupid
in this game i felt the easy players werent easy they play rather good for being supposed to suck at the game
so because they are easy they play good at a slow speed or if the games requires a certain distance they fail at certain distances
in previous games easy computers was a laugh here they appear really goodanyway lets say you play a game with a friend you are forced to use  computers
you use them on easy they never win a single minigame
that would make you a winner right
wrong
this game is purely luck and walking fast
the computer players always hit  they land on all the bonus places and they can get  coins on a single turn
there is also a secret star area when you hit a golden space you get transported there
me and a family member played this game toad was a computer player
within  turns he had already gone to the secret area
then he went there two times more
and yourself usually get to the secret area  out of  times playing a whole board game
so at the end he got over  stars within  turns
thats just impossible to prevent there is no chance time and duel only lets you steal  coins ive only seen stars as a choice twice
so basically the computer players never win a single minigame but are so lucky they get coins and stars all the timeit gets even worse
the boards feel uncreative and slow
the only way you get starts if you are quick enough that means hitting  all the time
this what the computer players do
this is not what you do
yourself get  if youre really lucky you get  i mean sometimes i get  several times in a row and the computer player is almost at the star
to sum all the boards updonkey kong star is far away so get there quicklygoomba star is very far away its also free so you just gotta get there quicklyshy guy train star is far away costs  or 
 get there q u i c k l ykoopa town only board worth it you put money into hotels to be the owner
you dont need to be quick hereboos mansion get qiuckly to boo to get a star for  coinsits all about walking fast since you get so much money from bonuses you dont need the minigame money
basically i can have  coins but i only hit  then i dont have much to use the coins for because i cant buy stars or candy if i dont quickly get therethe  player star battle was pure torture it was all about luck to win against the computer playersanother problem with this game is that there is a lot of dialogue and scenes you cant skip
especially when the last  turns are announced i button mash the a button like crazy but each text box takes  to get rid of
then it takes  seconds to show each player then more dialogue
it takes  minutes just to get through this sceneand on the board especially when you walk on the golden space sometimes you need to be transported
you sit in a car and get driven to the place you need to go
it takes like  seconds to a minute to get there
and you cannot skip it
this slows the game down so badthis game is only fun when you play with  friends and even then the game can be boring
you can only win this game is you are lucky
out of  times playing ive won  times
i just dont bother doing my best anymore because i know im going to loose anyway just because im so unlucky in this gameone last warning do not buy the thing that allows you to tease your opponents in the fun zone
you cannot turn this off so everytime you move your control the characters starts making the same sounds over and over
even if you just move the control to put the control somewhere the characters starts talking
for example peach can say i am the princess and bleeeh
she says i am the princess  time out of  so when you move the control just slightly she goes bleehbleh
 bleh
 bleh
its beyond irritatingi read some really great reviews about this game
after the initial play my kids havent touched it since
when comaring it to other games such as just dance  or kirbys epic yarn or disney universe it really doesnt stand up to them
my kids are    which maybe why they are not very interested in it
for younger children i can see how itd be funmario party  is essentially a collection of  mediocre at best mini games designed for the nintendo wii and the motion sensing wiiremote
what makes mario party unique is that it takes the form of a traditional board game with players taking turns to roll the dice block and move ahead the number of spaces shown
the virtual game board has many different types of spaces players can land on each producing different effects
the primary objective of the game is to collect more stars than the other players
the winner of the game is the player with the most stars after all the turns have been completedas with most other party games mario party  is best played with multiple preferably four friends
however the game can also be played alone or with less then four people in this case the computer takes over for any absent playerunfortunately the game is not very engaging making only limited use of the wiimote and moves painfully slow
this becomes a real big issue when playing the game as a single player
in this situation the player is forced to sit and watch until all three computer controlled characters finish taking their turn
overall the game relays heavily on luck which becomes frustrating especially when playing against the computer
adding these shortcomings to the mediocre and often boring mini games makes mario party  a very unattractive gamewe did not like this version as much as some of the older mario partiesi heard a lot about this game and was very excited to finally buy it
unfortunately i was extremely disappointed with it
the game was very boring and after about an hour of repetition we gave up
we returned the game the following daynot widescreen
ive played every mario party
ive enjoyed them up until about  thats when they started making big mistakes
this is the worst mario party yet
ill explain whyfirst and most obvious is the hdtv problem
this game is not in  widescreen at all
it fools you at first
the first screen and the menu is in full wide screen but the actual game and the minigames are all in  format with horrible patterned borders on each side
a very cheap and annoying ploy by nintendo
the graphics look great but then when you start playing it looks worse than gamecubetip change your settings to  instead of  on a widescreen tv
then just change your aspect ratio
this will give you the same game but without the annoying bars
you can still have it in p it just wont be next is the controls
they are very far from imaginative
its basically simplified warioware
you do very simple tasks to complete a minigame and most of them are boring and dumb
some games require movements with the remote that just dont work most of the time
youll find yourself failing right away most of the time just because of the controlsnow we have the game boards
they are completely different this time
its basically a race to see who can roll the biggest numbers
they give coins away like crazy so winning minigames is almost worthless
i finished one game against the computer on easy and we all had  stars
dumb
i won all the minigames yet the computer always had over  coins
most of the boards are stupid and cheap and will just make you madthen we have single player mode
this is way different from party mode but you have to play it to unlock some stuff
the only problem its unfair
you play against the computer and they constantly get perfect rolls tons of money and tons of candy
i have yet to win the first match after  attemptsthe game is unfair barely fun annoying and has tons wrong with it
i was really close to just getting it from gamefly but i love mario party so i bought it
if you really want to play it put it on your list
its not worth the money in the same way cooking mama isnt
for the most part it doesnt even seem finishedif you liked mario party  or  youll feel let down by this one
i feel ripped off with this gamei had high hopes for this game
nintendo could have done a lot with the wiis capabilities in a game like this
nonetheless all they did was recycle the same old button mashers or guess what bomb will blow up your friend type games
it was really disappointing and felt like the game was hastily thrown together
it felt more like a port from the gamecube than it did an original game
this is probably the worst nintendo made game out for the wii right now
save yourself some money and wait till better multiplayer games come outnot as good as i expected
the warioware games are much better
maybe it was too kiddish for me
to simple not much depth here
get warioware touched or twisted insteadcake mania isnt the first flash game to find itself on the ds nor the first game to feature a look at the culinary arts
regardless of either fact cake mania is a game that is shallow repetitive and overall not very fun
playing as a girl named jill your mission is to run your bakery and perform tasks such as baking serving the orders of customers and the like
all this is done by tapping the touch screen with the stylus when various icons appear
it sounds easy but cake mania features a startling level of difficulty that may surprise those who had blasts of fun with cooking mama
not to mention that the sheer monotony of it all weighs in more frustration than anything else which kills what could have been a fun concept
the game looks good with bright and colorful graphics and animations and the game features a bargain price tag to boot but with the repetitive and shallow gameplay and zilch in terms of multiplayer features as well which actually would have been welcome here cake mania just isnt worth the headaches
all in all fans of games like cooking mama and such may want to give cake mania a look but dont say you werent warnedi thought this game to be very behind in todays market
the gameplay was not interesting or fun the story was awful and the monsters childish
i must have played this game for a half hour before turning it off and posting it on ebay
i found jetforce gemini to have more redeming qualities
i wouldnt pay more than  for this titlejet force geminiearth defense force  is a great idea for a video game and looks amazing
it seems custom made for an oldtime scifi geek like myself
and for a few levels there i thought id found a real gem
but after hours of ridiculously repetitive gameplay i found continuing on to be more of a chore than a joy
this is a fun game thats great for kids and very enjoyable for pickupandplay coop sessions but in comparison with the other games that available out there even among bargain bin titles this one just doesnt cut itthe premise is simple and awesome
you are an edf trooper protecting the world from an alien invasion
first giant bioengineered ants spill into major cities then enemy attack craft and huge robots followed by giant spiders and eventually giant bosses
thats the limit of the enemys diversity
its be great if the game was shorter but we are talking about dozens upon dozens of levels of hundreds and hundreds of the same foes to shoot
they all look great and there is so much going on at any given time that the first few waves are going to make you think this is the greatest thing you have ever played
likedynasty warriorswith giant science fiction monsters
except that any strategic aspects are abandoned and instead of having several attack combos different characters and stories to choose from all you do is point and shoot point and shoot point and shoot
and if you use homing missiles you dont even have to point just shoot
it becomes mindnumbing very quickly
the dinomech is epically awesome though
love those bossesthe weapons fare better than the enemies as far as variety goes
there is a great selection but the fact that there are so many variant models of every single one is annoying and leaves you pondering the tiny differences between different versions of the same weapons to decide which you want to use
this is fantastic if youre obsessivecompulsive but kind of a pain if you want to keep it as simple as the gameplay but still use the most effective gear
i love the attention to detail but come on there is a limit
favorite weapons include the giant autoturrets shotguns and flamethrowers for getting up close and personal and homing missiles for long distance assaults
getting the weapons annoyingly depends entirely on random drops from defeated enemies
would it have killed them to implement a money system
higher difficulty levels yield stronger weapons but i defy anybody to take on the higher difficulties alone and actually enjoy themselves
they were designed for frustrations sakethe dealbreaker for me in edf are the vehicles
there are a few types of vehicles you can use to assault the monstrous masses with
sweet right
well it should have been a highlight of the game but the fact is that youre better off on foot most of the time
the controls are worse than clunky the reaction time is ridiculously slow and aiming the weapons is typically a fools errand
different vehicles have these problems to varying degrees but they all suffer from at least one of them
the mechsuit is armed to the teeth and can wreak havoc on encroaching enemies
it can even hover a little which serves no real purpose but is still pretty cool
but the thing moves and turns so slow and the enemies are so fast that you can only fight in one so long as the enemies remain directly in front of you
so useless
the helicopter takes ages to take off and then handles terribly
considering you are flying in between buildings and trying to aim at the same time this makes it functionally useless for anything besides transport
and i thought the copters ingrand theft auto ivwere tough to fly
the hoverbikes are actually good but have little firepower and are quickly destroyed
the tank would be the best but aiming and rolling at the same time is very difficult and its doesnt fare well against multiple enemies
and multiple enemies is exactly what youre up against
they should have spent much more time tweaking this featurein conclusion edf is a great game for a couple of casual gamers to play for a couple hours and then retire
it should have been an xbox live arcade download and not a full game
the features are nonexistent there are only six spectacularly unimaginative achievements to earn i played long enough to earn none and the whole package just strikes me as having been lazily throwntogether
i dont know when japanese game developers became so jaded and boring but they need to take care of business and find that creativity of old before the flood of western masterpieces washes them right out of the industry  stars rounded down for screwing up a perfect conceptthe saves are spaced too far apart in this game
i got bored doing a half hour of the game over because i was killed with one shotthis one shouldve stayed with just one
gr was fun
this one was just ok i felt that the added features were just inconviniences that slowed the game down
not the best tactical shooteri really didnt find any interest in this game i was expecting it to be like cod or halo or battlefield i was surprised at it and every time i try to give it another chance i get board in  minfor some reason it just seems too complex and is just not my cup of tea
thanks for your timei dont know if im the only one who noticed this but this game is more or less the same as aw
the story is really the same and granted i might be missing the subleties honestly a better title wouldve been awagain or awhuge expansion pack of the same action
comparing this game to the bigger shooting titles like call of duty or halo this game doesnt really compare
the aforementioned big titles are there for a reason and while this game has its fun points if youre looking for a good fps game just do yourself a favor and get call of duty youll be glad you didgreat story and graphics
i just despise the inability to shoot straightthe damn reticle is all over the place
it drives me insaneand not in a good way
this aint no island thunderwhich i consider the best st person shooter everthis was the first game that i bought for my psp slim and it was not worth  dollars
 dollars is basically the full price of a just released psp game and i was utterly disappointed with it
its a good premise but the crappy controls and shallow story line make the whole game frustrating
frustrating that you spent so much of your own hard earned money to buy
the graphics are good but there is little substance
the game was so easy that i beat it in all of  days
there is also little reason to replay this game which further degrades its worth
my advice to you just buy another game or perhaps two since this game is so ridiculously expensivei dont really know what it is about this game that was such a disappointment to me
nothing really stands out as exceptionally bad its just that the whole game has an awkward and clunky feel to it
the players dont respond well the control is far from being intuitive and easy to use and the game is just overall pretty bland
there are some nice touches like being able to encourage your teammate or fire up or mock if youre playing an away game the crowd but the whole game just feels lackingmarch madness features the ability to create your own player but the game places no cap on his stats
want a  footer with a  rating in stealing dribbling and  point shooting as well as rebounding and blocking
no problem
the ability to create these supermen players really detracts from the player creation in my opinionthe dynasty mode and online options have some interesting features but with such weak gameplay these things really dont matter
actually playing basketball isnt fun and no amount of customization in the dynasty mode is going to save this from being a subpar gamei am rather baffled at the moment here it is midjanuary and march madness shows up two to three months late
it should have been released in november  at the beginning of the college basketball season
i figured ea had something special someting k bunker buster  a dagger in the heart a slow painful death to its competitionno can domarch madness again falls sinks skids and does not even come close to its counterpart college hoops
and i was not fond of college hoops to begin with
dont need to explain why since this review isnt about college hoops k but we gamers love to compare and contrast similar simulations
mm has some nice things dont get me wrong
i like the intensity control the dynasty mode and school pride is great as well
the frontend menu and load screens are the best outdoing anything k could present
the graphics as always shines and probably to a degree are a twomonthahead better than ch kswhat about mms gameplay
there shouldnt be excuses
ea had plenty of time right
i guess not enough time
honestly the gameplay is pretty bad
seriously
at first it may seem fine it may seem cool on the edge of innovation and then the game does some interesting stuff ala stupid programming errors  stuff
these are glitches that should not be in a nextgen game
i mean here we have people shelling out  or more for nextgen consoles and  a pop for a game and all we get is an annoying glitchy basketball sim
come onim not going to rant  and complain
there will be a few of you out there who will do a fine job at that after playing mm a few times
i tried to give this game a chance i really did
i spent most of the day playing it and maybe im rushing it a bit but whenever your edited player suddenly disappears awol from the bench no where to be found in the lineup when you want to substitute him back in then something is terribly wrong
this happened twice to me
i will also add that youd better not dribble within three feet along the baseline without it calling you out of bounds
add that in and along with some horrible foul calling
the players simply react like currentgen instead of nextgenfinally i really wanted to like this game something i was delusional about with nba live  but with all its glitchy gameplay i just cant
sorry ea but you let me down again
hopefully when the ps and the next xbox  are out in five years we will see a true nextgen basketball simulationi have play every single final fantasy game out other than  x and xi and this is by far my least favorite
not to say that it sucks because i know i am in the minority but hear me out
if you want nostalgic effect go ahead and play this game
you may like it because of your bias
final fantasy v did a better job of ap distribution
although what makes ff vi good is that you keep whatever you learn in terms of spells you can only use summons once per battle when they arent even that helpful magic is easily better than weapons and only a few characters will have a high enough magic stat to make it worthwhile
i played this hearing that is was better than ffvii which people say is overrated ive played it and to be honest it was my first ff game but even after playing most other ff games i still think its the best i decided to buy it and play it
if you are a completionist in terms of game series then itd be a good experience
i am one of those people and this game was really disappointing
i was expecting much more than ffvii quality than this and i got less
character development sucked
people say its good because there are a ton of characters and each character is defined but i want quality of quantity
you couldnt grow on a character since they werent built upon very muchthe only good thing i can say about this game is that this ff sports probably the greatest villain of any game ive played he actually succeeds and is the most coldhearted character to meet
i really only enjoyed this game whenever he was around or ittldr if you want something of ffvii calibur or if you think ffvii sucked dont consider buying this game
if you liked it waaay back and you want to play it again dont bother
it isnt that differentfrom a nostalgia perspective ff vi may only appeal to an older group of foks who have played this game when they were younger on more primitive gaming platforms
however for  people like myself some be turned offi offer up this analogy if your first car was an old beat up chevy nova that you have a lot of fond memories in then taking a ride in that car for old times sake can bring back those great memories
however if you delayed getting your license until later in life and your first car was a new bmw taking a drive in a beat up nova now is going to feel pretty lame
if your first experiences in rpgs include knights of the old republic final fantasy x  xii and elder scrolls iii  iv then  ff vi is going to be that chevy novai tried to like this game but i am also playing it on a ds lite thereby further tarnishing my opinion of the game
the graphics and sound are basically limited
the story is incredibly overrated and just didnt grip me in the least
to boot the battle system just pales in comparison to the aforementioned rpgssorry i dont want to offend anyone this is just a humble opinion from someone who has only experienced rpgs in the last three years so please take that into considerationi like keeping things simple where remotes are concerned
i normally opt for an endtable full of specialized manufacturer remotes over one more complicated universal remote where unless i know how to program a computer it still wont give me all the functions of the original remote or will require flipping through multiple files and folders to find the device im wanting to operate
of course since the ps uses bluetooth even the more sophisticatedexpensive remotes are less practical to the task
this makes it all the more disappointing that after several years sony still hasnt released a better alternative for controlling their most heralded piece of technologyi can appreciate sonys design sense in that this remote has the same basic shape as all of our other sony remotes
otherwise there really doesnt appear to be much thought or effort that went into the design
after several ps updates including a major makeover in the psslim design what amounts to just slapping all the possible buttons one might ever use into a cheap plastic slab and writing playstation on it is still the only viable alternative for those that dont find the gaming controllers optimal or adequate for bd movie playback
does sony not even get that theres a sizable market of people looking for something better
look at all the aftermarket devices claiming to be made just for the ps but getting very mixed reviews as to their quality reliability and performanceforget trying to use this remote in the dark or very dim environments most typical of ht youll need plenty of light to see what youre pressing not to mention your reading glasses
even then the buttons are so small tightly clustered and uniformly colored sized and shaped you may lose a minute of the movie trying to find the right one even with the light on
thank heaven the ps is so fast at loading and processing commands
if i accidentally hit stop instead of pause while fumbling in the dark to answer the phone on my panasonic bd players remote not only would i lose my spot in the film it would take another  minutes for the disc to reloadaside from the remote being rather ugly and unfriendly as its just too small for all the dots it tries to connect we dont like how pressing any botton automatically turns on the ps
with an end table full of remotes and kids visiting now and then its just too easy to activate
and with blue tooth we practically have to carry it to the other end of the house just to lightly dust the remote without issuing who knows what type of commands to the ps with the tv off  pointing the remote away from the screen is nolonger an optionthe ps is a magnificent piece of engineering that proves that sony can do much better
this remote neither lives up to expectations for sonys premium piece of electronics nor does it compliment its engineering innovation or style
just adding a backlight and hiding half the keys most will rarely if ever use under a sliding door like some of their other remotes would go along way toward making this remote more userfriendly and functional
if only they would tryalthough i love sony the playstation and sony products i fail to see the value in this device
it seems like a waste of money
basically you can perform the same functions with the controller
it is too complex for those people who cannot use the controller
so i do not really get the point of it
plus a lot of functions you would like to see it perform  are not arranged in a logical fashion
i would skip this and just use the controller
for people who cannot master the use of the controller this remote is too complexan extremely tedious controller if their ever was one button placement is lousy there is no backlight and if you press any of the overlysensitive buttons on this controller it powers on the ps as i am reminded over and overunfortunately if you intend on using your ps as a dvdbluray player then this is a fairly essential purchase but only because it is literally the only game in town
almost no universal remotes will work on the ps due to its bluetoothonly wireless capabilitiesi actually like this remote in terms of layout and functionality and bluetooth is nice actually since you dont need to point it at the ps but not having it backlit was a terrible decision by sony
for  they cant even put in a light so you can see which tiny button youre pressing while youre watching your decidedly unimpressive bluray movieas others stated this is one busy remote
there are more buttons on it than a remote for a complex stereo system
i also do not like how it takes pressing a button twice because the remote has to wake up first
plus with no button pushing indicator light you cannot tell if what you did worked or nota must have
no i do not think it is a must have
a would be ok to have is better terminology
hopefully a third party remote will come along that is a little better than this
it did some with sony batteries so it is nice you do not have to buy those right awayif you have the money to get this do so
you can live with it
if money is tight use it to buy another controller
yes not as pleasant as a remote but a controller has more uses with a ps obvioulsywe never could get the remote to operate the ps  but dont know if it is operator error or bad remoteif you watch movies in the dark there is no back light
absolutely terrible oversightthe buttons are in an unexpected order
they go play stop pause instead of play pause stop
hitting stop on accident will ruin your night trust methe buttons also go scan prevnext then slowmo
i would expect prevnext then scan then slowmoany button turns on your ps
why not only the ps button
turn on the ps on accident all the time bluetooth so sight lines dont matter which is cool
wish my other remotes were like thisits a remote and it works not rocket science
its better than using the dual shock  but i wouldnt buy it again unless they added a back light
thats  minus and one plus
the lack of the back light is my biggest complainti was a little miffed i even needed to get this because i already had a universal remote harmonythis remote works as advertised but the layout is less than stellar and they tried to map every single ps control button to the remote so its laden with buttonsalso you have to treat the remote just like one of the controllers and use the ps button to turn it onoff
honestly i think this is just an elongated ps controllerthe other issue is that when you  havent used the remote for a bit and it goes to sleep and then you issue a button press like pause or stop you have to do it twice because the first time the button press wont do anything except wake the remote up then the second button press will actually workthe obnoxious part about the remote is that it has no indicators of any kind on it
so you cant tell if its on off asleep synced or out of batteries
you just use it and if you push a button  or more times and it doesnt do anything its safe to assume its deada simple led on the top would have done the trick but then they wouldnt be able to keep the  margin of profit they make on this piece of hardwareoverall its a poor remote some throw in you would expect with a normal tv and overly unacceptable as a remote for a nice tv not even backlitbut its the only way to control movies on the ps without using the controller so if you need it i guess you are going to buy ityou can do everything on your game controller that you can on here
it takes about one half hour to learn the controlls on the game controller but you can do everything right there
why have another big remote cluttering up your coffee table area
just use your top button i think the triangle and then go to menuthen hit triangle again and go right to all the secial features
it is really a snap and works fine
the movie remote does not turn on the ps so you will have to grab your controller anyways for that
a waste of spacegiven the choice between no remote and this remote i will still use this one but it feels like a brick in my hand
poor to no ergonomic design when in to this
they could learn a great deal from tivo
the button layout is also poor given how much research went in to the ps controller you would think some thought would have gone in to this remotes layout
the biggest problem is the stop button between the play and pause button
that added to the fact that bluray will not resume were you left off after you hit stop make this an unforgivable flawit loses some picture quality and its such a lowquality cable often the part plugged into the back of the wii needs adjusted or you will have a discolored screen and a buzzing noisei would get a better one of i were youthey worked great for a few days but then started to cause screen flickering
really disappointed that they quit on me but i didnt think it would be worth the hassle to returnim used to the call of duty controls and graw s controls are not good the gameplay is not good because the controls are awful and the graphics are decent which is not a positive i sold ghost recon  to gamestop without beating the gamei bought this game thinking that it was going to be similar to a call of duty type game and i also bought it for my  year old son
after playing this game for  week i traded it at my local gamestop store
you spend so much time trying to dodge the bad guys selecting the right weapon to use commanding your squad to move and shoot controlling a uab and other misc items that it gets pretty tiresome
i have played many shooting games and this game was more frustrating than fun
if you want to play a good shooting game id highly recommend battlefield bad company instead
my son loves to play it online
the missions are fun and easy and you get to blow up alot of stuff
if youre still thinking of buying ghost recon  rent it insteadi loved some of the older tmnt games but this one is really sad
the graphics are alright but thats the only good thing to say about it
there is no multiplayer or coop of any kind which is unforgiveable
the really sad thing about this game is the near absence of fighting
yes its true
you spend most of your time climbing around and navigating the level and occasionallyvery occasionallyyou get in a fight
but the fights are seriously lame
i just cant believe they released this game there really isnt anything to it
 levels of basically running around and beating up the occasional batch of punks
easy achievements if thats important to you but otherwise dont waste your timeor moneyalright ill admit it right up front
i bought this game for the  gamerscore and no other reason
i knew it wasnt a very good game but i also heard it wasnt complete crap
this is true there are a couple fun sections and some of the one liners are pretty great but over all youre not going to have much fun with this unless a youre under  b you absolutely love the turtles c you accidentally play some other game thinking its this one
technically it works fine the controls are pretty much fine and graphically it doesnt look bad
so theres thatbasically if you arent buying it for a child dont expect much
if youre in it for the gamerscore devote an afternoon to it
the achievements are super easy so it wont take more than one playthroughtmnt is the latest of the teenage mutant ninja turtles games and is the companion to the recent movie of the same title
you fight as each of the turtles and sometimes can switch between them through several stages i think there were  or  that more or less often less accompany the plot of the movie
this is a typical moviebased game short and without anything defining to make it really worthwhile but not a complete waste of time if you rent itthe goodwell it is the turtles so thats a definite plus if youre a fan of either the originals or the new moviethe fighting and some of the turtles abilities are fun for a little while at least to mess around withthere arent many unlockables but there are a few fun things you can unlock to add variety to the game including big heads for the turtles halloween costumes for the bad guys and weekend weapons
the badthe game is very short
it took me between  and  hours to complete the game
after completing each stage with an a rating you unlock the ability to play the stages again and find special gold coins in the stage but theres really no reason to do this and i see little replay value in the gamethe game is very easy with a few really tricky parts
you can die as many times as you want and just keep on playing and you can fall or miss jumps or whatever and it really doesnt matter
that made me think the games difficulty was tailored to younger people but later in the game some of the jump sequences especially on the last stage are so difficult they require much more skill than the rest of the gameno multiplayer
i understand that some of the stages like those with raph as the watchman take place with only one turtle but what made all the old ninja turtles games so great was the ability to play with your friendsthe camera angle is annoying at times and there are many times when youre trying to do a certain kind of jump and end up falling to your death because you cant see well enough to line it up correctly or the game just executes the wrong movethis game is worth renting if youve really got nothing better to do or if you want some quick achievement points on the  but i definitely wouldnt buy it
its fun for a while a short while but by the time you play the short story mode through youll be more than ready to move on to something elsei work over at gamepro magazine and i was able to borrow a copy of tmnt
i borrowed it on friday beat it on saturday night
mind you i also went out to a couple of movies between that time frame
i think i beat the game and unlocked the achievements in about  hours
uninspired gameplay ok graphics definetly not up to xbox standards camera angles get clunky and once youve beaten the game and played some of the vr mission type unlockables in the game your done
also there is only single player mode
you cant have your friends play as the other turtles you can only do one at a time through switching your charcters during gameplay and the power team ups to take down you enemies
i definetly wouldnt shell out  for this game
since i got to borrow the game i think i enjoyed it a little more than i would have if i payed  for a rental
if you are really itching to play this game i suggest renting it
so here are the pros and consprosgreat voice actingawesome art stylethe team ups are greatsome of the platforming elements are funconsfunky camera angelsuninspired gameplayno multiplayerbattle system is lackingoverall id give this game a  out of tmnt teenage mutant ninja turtles is the videogame tiein for the tmnt movie released in march 
ultimately the movie seems driven more by the need to keep a toy line and franchise alive than any creative inspiration says kirk honeycutt from the hollywood reporter
unfortunately the same is true for the videogame
tmnt can be summarized by running jumping and occasionally fighting several identical badguys
the game does not require any puzzlesolving or brain activity to speak of
we were able to complete the xbox version of the game in about  hours which was largely do to the easy difficulty and unlimited lives
tmnt only offers single player mode with no multiplayer whatsoever
the game may appeal to children because of its easy difficulty and famous characters but unless you have unlimited or free game rentals tmnt is not worth your time or money
on a positive note tmnt will provide the easiest  points for our xbox gamerscore evertmnt is a passable actionadventure game geared more towards kids and inexperienced gamers
the main content of the game has you as the members of the turtles performing ninja acrobatics to cross the city of new york to get to a rare fight with a couple baddies or a boss
there is really no risk of failure in the game since whether you fall off a building whilst attempting acrobatics or you come up short in a fight with an enemy your turtle just springs back to life
there is no depth in gameplay as everything can be accomplished with easethe best thing about tmnt is that you will achieve at least  gamerscore and with only a little extra effort you will gather the full  gamerscore
it took me five hours of gametime to get the k
if you want to boost your gamerscore by  and pay budget price for a game this is the one to get
the five hours are fun enoughi want to try and be careful in my review here
im thirty and i didnt like  this very much
the problem is that tmnt was clearly made for someone who is a lot younger then i am
it feels wrong somehow to be ripping a game that the developer ubisoft never really intended for me to play anyway
it has the same vibe as if i was whining that i couldnt ride around on my nephews powerwheels quad
i did want to at least point out a few issues that id had thoughfirst the graphics are somewhere around a pretty good ps game
this is not something that youre going to use to show off a nextgen system at all
it feels like and probably was it was ported over from an older console
i dont think it hits the point of being flatout ugly but not the least bit impressive eitherthe gameplay i thought was awful
its criminal that one of the central themes of any turtles game since the original nes console was teamwork and yet we get no coop or online multiplayer
this feature alone would have been enough for me to make a purchase
the fact that it wasnt included is wildly disappointing and a total letdownthe enemy ai
is below average
none of the enemies i fought were particularly difficult and generally tended to stay in one place and not put up too much of a fight while i whaled away at them
again though this was intended for someone much younger giving the benefit of the doubt someone under ten might find this a bit more challenging then i did
its also virtually impossible to die
if your health runs out or if you fall off a ledge you respawn right where you left off
the game is over basically whenever you decide to stop playingthe game is terribly short
if youre motivated you could finish this in four or five hours
i again feel the need to point out that this was intended for a much younger player
maybe it would take them a while longer
for me though chalk this up as a rental only
its an easy  achievement points but its doomed to leave anyone over ten ultimately unfulfilled and not worth anywhere near fifty bucks for a new copy
grab an xbox marketplace card and download the  coinop version of tmnt instead it may be a little older but youll have twice as much fun at about a quarter of the costdont get the idea this game has anything to do with world war ii
the only similarity is some of the airplanes used in that confict are also present here
other than that it is completely fictitious
the game is loaded with planes that never made it off the drawing board let alone into production
also there is not a single american plane to choose from
no p mustangs no p thunderbolts no p lightenings no ff hellcats etc
these planes dont stall
you can fly straight vertical forever in any of the propeller planes or jets
ridiculous
the missions are all preposterous and entirely fictitious
one of them has you flying over san francisco bay shooting down rockets with rocketsa technology still in its infancy even today
the submarines launching the rockets areget readygerman uboats
wouldnt it be a little more likely to have japanese submarines off the pacific coast
the last mission is so imbecilic it made me groan
you have to shoot down a giant aircraft carrier airplane thats constantly launching dozens of smaller fighters to harass you
another mission has you flying your plane into and through a series of long underground tunnels destroying generators
you know the type of flying they all did in wwii
giveth unto me a break
story is moronic
it reminded me of pss secret weapons over normandy swon in that you are constantly having to rescue an annoying girl named marguerite
in swon her name was rose
same differencewouldnt it have been nice to have even a modicum of historical accuracy here guys
there is no battle of britain no midway no air war over germany no real pacific aircraft carrier action at allthis is just ace combat in the guise of a wwii game
false advertisingnever played this much because of the lame control schematics
i even tried customizin them to no avail
only good thing is that it had derek jeter on the boxso i rented this game
i am glad i did
if you are considering buying this game i strongly recommend renting it first
perhaps ill be wrong and youll love it but if you dont like it you saved yourself a ton of cashfirst the goodthe game looks great
it takes advantage of the ps hardware and really make it feel alive
i had someone replacing the tile walk by a few times and he didnt notice it was a game until the rd time he walked bythe voice overs are very well done
they are meshed well to sound like real comments being made by announcers
as you play it more they will get a bit repetitive but they still did a pretty good job herethe badthe gameplay
okay on to the specificsthe batting interface with the sixaxis controller sucks
it is hard to see where a ball is heading ahead of time unless you get lucky with the batters eye and as a result most will take lots of swings at balls that are nowhere close
it can also get somewhat tiring constantly shoving the controller out and you will do it pretty hard if you want to hit homersspeaking of home runs wow
i guess the game assumes everyone is on steroids but good lord it is easy to knock it out of the park
tilt the controller back time it right and boom gone
this is balanced out by the cpu robbing you frequently and knocking it out of the park all the time itself
maybe i am remembering baseball wrong but i dont remember people hitting home runs  times a gameon the subject of robbing this is the part that just got to me the most because it was so ridiculous
here was the final straw for me game  of the world series down by  bottom of the th  man on
there are  outs and the count is  i got a good line on the ball coming in and crack gone
oh wait the fielder climbs on the fence again and robs you of your home run again
this might be disheartening once but when this is the fourth time that game that you were robbed of a home run it is just plain ridiculousfinally base management
stealing bases and moving your people around the bases after a hit is not easy
it is doable but it is a major pain and mistakes are easy to makeoverall this was an okay game
but the gameplay especially the constant robbing of home runs just ruins it
my blood pressure was higher playing this game than any other game ive played before and i was ordered to take it back by my girlfriend before i broke the controller
some might enjoy it but you might want to experience the ridiculousness of the game itself as a rental first before forking over the cash to buy itto start with the timing of the controls make it very frustrating
xbox  games are supposed to be known for their great control system and every other  game that ive played does
you cannot get used to these controls
i bought another controller to see if it would make a difference no dice
mlb k for gamecube has very responsive controls nintendo  nintendo has beaten microsoft by a whole year
the worst part is the graphics are hardly better than mlb k for the wii nintendo again the gameplay too
mlb k really screwed up this yearnow writing this in  k is at the end of their contract for making mlb games
so we can sit back and play the few good ones they made regardless of the console
this is not one of themupon playing this game for the first time i wasnt sure if i mistakenly picked up mlbk insteak of   the opening screen is wellexactly the same
the choices are all well exactly the same
gm mode and franchise mode moved the gamer menu buttons from the left side to the top but other than that theres no difference from k
well maybe things will change when i get into a gamewell pitches come at you a little bit faster
you have to judge whether to swing in about a quarter of a second even less if you want to put some power on it
baserunning is still frustrating
fielding is downright atrocious
the players look more real though and they definitely move more fluently
its still raining inside miller park even though the stadium has a retractable roof which even the announcers point out making it more assinine as to why theres rain falling inside
ratings are still biased towards the teams that spend the most money
rookies that appeared in last years game disappeared in this one
the only addition to gm mode is the ability to look at your average attendance and change ticket prices
just like a real gmwell they finally finished last years game
its still subpar and it still doesnt do anything for me
goodbye k series baseballi have about  games in my collection and ill have to say that this is one of the most difficult to play
i have the old splinter cell games and enjoyed them very much but this is a whole different animal
i played this like i normally would by starting on level  but after a frustrating  missions started over on easy
it didnt get much better so after  missions i turned to another game
i gave this a  only for the story and will try it again but only if i find myself in a situation where i have only this game to play and possibly a few hundred hours to burn upim not much for name brand but after buying this after market cable i am all sold for name brand
it does matter i guess this cable did not give the quality picture i was expected i went to target and bought one for  dollars and wow blew my mind at how different it looks
i guess it all comes down to this you do get what you pay fori have a  hd p television yes it will do p
not much of a difference if any difference was notedi absolutely loved nba street  on the ps
 and  where ok but  was the best
its almost like ea sports took the concept of nba jam with all the crazy dunks no fouls containing not just the rosters of current nba teams but legends as well
the game was almost perfect
now ea have taken the street games to the next level of graphics for the ps
apparently this is the first game to utilize hd graphics on the ps
sure the graphics are good there is no complaint there
nor is it the controls the controls are perfect
they have not been modified other than you only need l and r to do different kinds of dunks which i miss the  shoulder button combinations but other than that the controls work perfectly
the game only glitched on me maybe two or three times and it was only a small graphic on the shorts that went away in a couple of seconds and the game only froze on me one time during a loading screen
so i cant say the programming is shoddyevery current nba team in  is here
for me the rosters arent much
i suppose if you like kobe shaq lebron james nash and carmello anthony then you will love playing as them perhaps but im someone who loves the classic old school players from the past whom where in the first  street games yet there is not one legend in this game at all
that was the first disappointment i came across
i thought perhaps there was a ray of hope when i heard you could download legends as dlc but they are not legends
they are the fictional characters from the first  games
so why are they dlc only
why should we have to pay for fictional characters that where free in the first  games
why are there no legends of the nba to play as
that would have at least given this game a lot more interest in continuing to play once the one player challenges are completedthe game play is the same as the first street games
 on  basketball usually a game to  points but you can also find yourself in games where you just need to lead by  points first to     points
it can also be customized
you can also play dunks only shots only and gamebreakers only rules
all pretty much the same as the first  games
which is disappointing really couldnt ea come up with some new modes of playwhat the most disappointing thing about this game is the create a baller has taken a major step backwards
you cannot customize your created player
you can only choose from existing models of players from the game
im not even sure that you can even choose from all of them
what on earth where ea thinking
creating characters has been huge in games for years now and many games have some awesome creataplayer options
but this one you cannot choose anything
you just pick an nba player thats from the game and use them as your characters model
you cannot change hair colors height weight gender male only or even something whacky like sticking them in a monkey suit
why the heck would ea do this
whats even worse is you can only choose if you are a guard forward or center then choose what your main  skill levels to level up on will be
but you cannot choose your style what kind of dunks you will do nor can you pick any nba jerseys to where in the game not even a number
can you beleive it
you play the whole game without a number on any of your michael jordan street jerseys you earn
not the bulls jersey just plain jerseys with the mj logo on it
speaking of jordan he is my favorite of all time but ea has really gone over kill with jordan shoes and attire in this game
the only time you can pick a new jersey to wear is when you earn one and apart from the  you begin with they are all jordan brand shirts
not only that all the shoes are jordan too
yet guess what take a wild guess who is not a playable character in this game
need i say morethe game modes are as followspick up game  exhibitionhome court challenge  the main game
compete as your created baller or should i say model of a current nba player and keep on playing a few pick up games or other modes as mentioned before to earn enough xp to go into a tournament
the tournaments are always the same
all these do is allow you to unlock and compete on the next court
you play through the season building up your xp levels and in the end all you get is a pathetic animation saying you have become a legend of the gameand then nothing
youve unlocked all courts big deal as there is a cheat to unlock all courts anyway and your created ballers stats have gone up
whoopdie doo
it only takes a day or two to complete home court challenge depending on how much time you have on your handswhatever other modes of game play  who carespractice  speaks for itselfthe courts themselves are apparently based on actual courts of a few of the nba stars courts they grew up playing on
introduced by a boring clip of whom they are the court of which gets skipped everytime it begins
personally i would like to have seen more courts
proper nba ones ones from the original  games and a few custom ideas
the courts in this well a couple are ok but some are hideous
it doesnt help that the vision during game play has a stupid sepia tone over it
apparently ea did this to make it look like youre watching old school footage of old school games
im sure carmelo anthony has a few  mm tapes of his old games in his collection at home somewhere
the even bigger joke is there is no old school players to play withthe music is not much
its there but for the most part you dont take notice of it
however its all jazz and hip hop sounding
obviously ea couldnt care less about the soundtrack so why would they care about putting in music that appeals to everyone instead just use generic stuff no one will take notice of
however that may just be my own opinion
if you take a look at the wikipedia page for this game it has a brief snippet of the game details and the rest is just the soundtrack listing for this game
that speaks loudly enough on its own without me having to say anything else about thatanother thing that has been left out from one of the previous streets is creating your own courts
you cant even create your own team anymore
its a real shame because this game has got the potential to make it a classic but as far as im concerned all its focus was on details rather than anything that will keep you interested in playing once you have completed thingsthe unlockables are a joke
as i said they are just courts mj training jerseys and mj shoes
most of it you unlock just winning during hc challenge
the rest are easily unlocked by just playing a certain amount of games in various modes
the only other unlokables are a couple of allstar teams
containing  or  current to the day nba stars who i couldnt give two  about playing as
funny tho the wnba is unlocked right from the start
yeah you read that right
there is  or  females to choose from the wnba to play as on their team
buggered if i know who they are but you can choose them off the bat in exhibition games
still cant create a woman thopros good graphics great controls fun for a little while two points for a double dunk game breaker  point dunks are a cool addition minimum data requirement is under kb
no installation neededcons no nba legends create a baller is a joke no create a nothing options lack of customization to anything but the bball game itself home court challenge is too easy not enough modes to play dlc contains fictional characters that should have already been in the game without the need to download them lack of courts not enough dunks to do with your player  dunks without holding a shoulder button holding one or both and they change when you have a game breakerplus you can do another  and only  when using l and r jumping off a teamates back during a game breaker oh and  when you dont have a gamebreaker activated and jump off them thats a total of about  dunks a player can do
but which sounds like quite a lot but by the time you have completed home court challenge you are bored of the same old dunks and want to either be able to change them or wish ea had included the r and l buttons to do more dunks too
like they did in the previous  games no more rim wrecking glass shattering backboard smashing pull the whole thing down dunks no hook shots holding l or r and shooting doesnt change the type of jump shot anymore alley oops need a lot more variations the sepia filter needs an option to turn it off
am i playing basketball or watching superman returns commentary players soundtrack what they say on the court needed more its annoying hearing the same old thing all the time intros are stupid the whole get out of the hood theme is irritating kobe bryant is in it hehehe no super blocks blocking is way too easy the trick moves lack in what you can do needs an option to trade nba players to other nba teams no jump ball to start player  automatically starts with an inbound pass could have used some effects on monster dunks like fire lightning or something not too over the top but something like they had in the previous games the loading profile screen is a little bugged
sometimes you have to load your saved data  or  times before the game asks you if you want auto save on or off
shouldnt it just save that data and go straight into the select a profile creating profiles needs to be done before starting the game up
it should be if you choose to be player two and it says load profile or choose your own you would think create might be amongst themoverall
if you never played nba street   or  on the ps
and you dont mind the fact you cant play as any legends
then you might think this game is pretty cool
having been someone who played the heck out of the first  this game here to me is just a version that has stepped up in the graphics but taken a giant step backwards in everything else
i wont say buy or do not buy i just hope seeing it the way i see it will help you decide on if you think it will appeal to you or not and not just give you a quick review of i like iti hate it or the ever annoying i bought this for my kids and they love it
i just hope my review gives you a more indepth perspective on what to expect and what not to expect
keep in mind tho i have never played this game online
however i cant imagine it being all that great from what i have been able to do so far
and beleive me i found it easy and not challenging so i have no beef with the ai or anything
and i do beleive i mastered the controls to what i want when i wanted
so dont get me wrong and think i was no good at the game or anything my biggest issue is as i said the lack of replay value and lack of options that where in in the first  games already
to me this game is one giant step backwards in what should have been a mind blowing game
even if it doesnt have nba legends to play asits an ok fighting game though a little bit on the old side of things like no vibration etc and they could have made the game better in many other ways but besides that its an ok game to play with friends and the story line is pretty interesting it hooks you into it but i mean you can only have like  profile etc which really sucksthis game is alright but it has many flaws
the only good parts of this game is the characters venues and the environment destruction
the fighting is slow the graphics are low quality and the story sucks
they turned a basic fast paced fightingwrestling game into building a label with dj scratching
this is a disappointment for the djv and djffnygraphics awesome soundtrack awesomegameplaynot so awesome
the controls are stupid
they got rid of all the crazy moves that you could do and the game is basically hit as many buttons as possible to win
its very frustrating and boring
no tag team or fatal  way either
the game went backwards for improvment except graphics
i suggest buying fight for ny even if you have a ps or xbox  hopefully if they do a th def jam theyll have a way better storyline more wrestlers etc and bring back the old controlsdef jam icon is one of the shallowest games ive played in years and is highly repetitive and boringyou get to create what your character looks like but you have to be male and you must be some shade of blackmixed
this character then goes through the trials and tribulations of becoming a bigshot music producer and you fight your way through all the confrontations in betweensounds like it might make a good game but its very linear and pretty much every decision you make in the management half of the game has little or no effect on anything
how good would it be to download your own tunes onto the ps and mix them into new tracks for the game
tough you cantthere are about  different environments to fight in but they all get rather tiresome after the millionth battle and there are never any really  cool moments when you interact with the crumbling area
def jam icon is all flash and no substance im afraid i actually likeddef jam fight for nya lot bettergraphics bsound bgameplay clasting appeal dif your a fan of this series your gonna be disappointed for sure
im not sure what the developers were thinking when they got rid of the blazing moves the ability to adapt styles and create new combos and the ability to interact with the enviroment ie
banging someones head into a car and causing damage or picking up a pool stick and crackin someone on the head with it
they replaced it with hazards that never change so all you have to do is memorize where they are and throw your opponent into it
the fighting is extremely slow and the moves are no longer crazy in a good way instead theyre pretty lame just kick and punch nothing flashy at all
the dj controls this game boasts about are only ok at best
while i think the idea was good it was poorly executed
lucky for us we got this on ps the guys who got it on the  are seriously hurting due to poorly mapped controls
this might be an ok game for those who hadnt played the previous ps versions since they wouldnt know what was missing
but if your like me getting the game because you liked the other two then your going to be really disappointed
when is ps gonna come out with a real game worth buying
if they dont do something soon they are gonna be in real trouble by the way god of war for the ps would be a much better way to blow your money than this garbageat least i got a  discount at phat pharm for preordering lol
revised  mar okay after playing the game a little more its not as bad as i initially thought
still a pretty crappy game but it warrants about  stars instead of  i think everyone should rent this game before buying because odds are youll either love it or hate it
im leaning more towards hate but in the essence of the game bringing new elements such as dj controls and owning and running a record label it deserves a shot
some people might find all the extra stuff appealing and i think if your a hip hop music fan more than a fighting game fan you might find this game enjoyablei dont know if ive ever seen any game come down in price this much this quickly
maybe its because no one wants to keep it for very longat first i thought this game was great
after playing it almost every day for about  weeks i have a very different viewprosmost of the games are actually fun at first
youll probably learn some words and their spelling
easy to pick upnow for the much longer list of consthis game does a terrible job of gauging your current level
it asks you far too few words almost all of which are highly advanced and placed both my friend and i far lower than it should have
theres nothing you can do about that
im  years old and after  weeks of updating my expression potential to  im still seeing words like kettle jaguar squirt traumatic solitary airfield canine rephrase acoustic receptive sparrow nutrition slang stumbling optimism and so forth
i would say  of the words ive seen on here are elementary school level while the other  are middleschool level
i have not learned a single word that i would consider calling highschool levelyoull learn very little for the time you spend playing
of the few words that were new to me hardly any of them were repeated more than a few times often in the same day
you are bombarded with far too many words over time when it should just be reinforcing groups of words before moving on to more
also the only time you actually learn anything is when you read through the definitions after each game
theres nothing at all to be learned by playing the games
it teaches you like a dictionary does
but the worst part is that there is no context or pronunciation
after playing for long enough you will eventually unlock a game that doesnt count toward your ep but does have recordings of the words being spoken as well as context examples
however you can only access these one random word at a time
you are given very little time to read the examples
this means that pronunciation and context are on the game but you cant look them up or access them at all while supposedly updating your potential to express yourself with words you dont necessarily understandthe definitions are often very weak
the part of speech verb noun is not given at all
if a definition is too long then it simply cuts off rather than allowing you to scroll down to read the whole thing
many words appear in their own definition which is never acceptable
words with multiple definitions will only have one of them provided
some definitions couldnt possibly be more wrong inflammable is defined as things that burn very easily
first of all inflammable is an adjective and the definition is given for a plural noun
also while it is technically true it has been a very long time since vernacular changed to avoid confusion and even my dictionary suggests that you not use the word like thisthe simple little games become mundane very quickly
you would have to play this game for several months to really get that much out of it but it will get very boring long before that
most of what your coach says to you is hardly better than mindless dribble
the graphics are quite simple and the music is extremely limited and dull
one day it randomly told me that the word of the week is minstrel
apparently the word of the week means a word you wont be learning because it never gave me the definition or even put it in any of the games
its not that uncommon for it to tell me that my ep has been updated when in fact it is exactly the sameultimately the developers were too lazy to provide the necessary elements for learning a new word make it accurately gauge your personal level come up with enough games to keep it interesting for a long time they didnt even make sure they got the definitions right
they started with a great idea and released a product that falls unforgivably short of its potential  while it might be useful to a foreign learner of english with such useful advice as a verb is an action word in a sentence
 it has some deficiencies that limit it for both native and foreign speakers
many of the games require you to know the meaning of a word in advance otherwise youll simply be playing guess which meaning is the right one
that is not a good way to learn new words
it can be a good way to reinforce what one already knows but that goes against the entire point
as a linguist myself i seriously question this productin addition the process by which your abilities are rated is entirely artificial
even scoring perfectly on many of the games i already have an extensive vocabulary i was rated as basically a simpleton in order to preserve the illusion that i am improvingnot recommended
language learning software has tremendous potential but it isnt even hinted at here
in fact its made to look laughablemy word coach for the nintendo ds is an educational video game designed to teach new vocabulary words
i really wanted to like this game but ultimately it fell short of what i had hoped it would bethe most important thing to know when considering purchasing this game is that it probably will help to build your vocabulary but only if you use it to the point where all the word games get old
in fact in my experience with this game i had to play on average twenty to thirty minutes just to reach my daily quota of words
the problem is that there are only about six games which means that things get old fairly fast
perhaps i am just not a very disciplined person but i began to lose interest in the games after a few days and by a couple of weeks i stopped playing the game altogetherhowever the games really can help you learn new words
when you start out the game evaluates what level your vocabulary is at
then it gradually introduces new words
i felt the balance was good between new words words i already knew and words that i was in the middle of learning
also the game has a dictionary feature included so you can easily look up definitions to wordsthe games are fairly fun but nothing super spectacular
some games are more helpful like the game where you write a letter in to complete a word matching a given definition while other games are less helpful like the falling blocks game that teaches you how to spell words rather than what they mean
i felt the handwriting recognition was fairly goodin conclusion if you like educational video games and are a very disciplined consistent person this game might be able to help you learn new words
however i think for most people this game will get old after only a few weeks or less so you may want to reconsider purchasing this gamei really wanted to like this game but i wont be spending much time with it
maybe if i had a nintendo ds to control it with it would be ok but with the wii it is impossible to play some of the games such as pasta letters up to speed
i might try it with my yearold because words at her level might be short enough to be doable
i also have a niggling thought that some of the ipod apps might be just as good for vocabulary development and be more accessiblelet me begin by saying i loved ssx on other systems namely gamecube
this has bad unresponsive controls
i like games that are easy to pick up  playdont have too much time to spend learning controls
and i have been gaming for years but the graphics are only okssx has gone downhill since ssx  and this one was probably the worst of all of them
the wii feature doesnt really add to the game and the graphics are bad
the newest ssx for xbox  is fun thoughi know people like this game for its previous titles but this game is barely playable
sometimes there is just no rhyme or reason for the controls
you can just wave the control around but you really have no idea what you are doing
difficult at best to get your character to actually do what you want them to doby the time your neck deep in this game youve had all the phoney accents you can stand
this game is a mishmash of cliches and stereotypes piled high on a bed of repeditive task that seemingly get you nowhere
sure you rise among the family people speak to you more nicely and all but in the end you keep getting sent oun on the same crappy jobsthe better plan would have made this a tactical game you play as the don and control and expand your empire
but no you play as a grease spot working his way up the ranks and you do the same things over and over and over and over and over againperhaps the problem is that i bought this game for myself and i am over the age of  yearsthe character art started off with promise but rapided declined into something miniaturized boring and with about as much visual stimulation and interaction as an ant farm
i gave this game about  minutes of attention before i decided that i could not bear looking at the boring small figures of townspeople running up and down the streets of the village any longerthen i deleted the game from my computer and decided to give it to my  year year old grandchild
i will let her know that this game does not require much participation
if she gets bored she can give it to someone younger than herselfdont buy this game if you are older than the only improvements this game shows are the graphics and the addition of third race scrin
cc games always sucked and will suck forever
the cutscenes between missions were unbelievably cheesy and boring even though they used some famous actorsactresses it was painful to watch them
i recommend getting world in conflicti like the idea of a diablo game in space but theres not a lot to love about this game
it all works ok but not seamlessly
you use the psps stick to move around but you cannot easily direct your fire
you fire which ever way you are facing
it is all too awkward and drains the fun out of the game
it doesnt help that the camera is too close to see your enemies approaching so that you can plan an attack
basically combat is more about you battling with the controls than battling the enemiespositiveseasy installation
no going online etcgraphics and sound effects goodcharacter creation great
can customize body proportions height hair facial features eyes nose chin mouth etc
this was very similar to a tiger woods golf gamecareer mode good  training coaches tournaments etcnegativesno option to set difficulty of game
no adjustment for mouse sensitivityno option to set perspective
sometimes you would be behind your character as in any other third person perspective game
then other times it would switch and you would be looking at your character from the other side of the court
you could not select one or the other or bothafter every point you had to watch players reactions
that got old very fastcontrols were extremely difficult to use
i was using keyboard and a corded optical mouse  when serving you would click was or d to start serve then watch a power scale and try to click again when it was at maximum
that part was ok
the problem was with returns
first you would move the mouse to where the ball was hit toward
then you would hit was or d for your swing type selection holding it down for more power and precision then move the mouse forward backward left right or diagonally to aim your shot
mind you this is all in the fraction of a second that it takes for the ball to reach your side of the court
the easiest option was to use the s key for a safe shot
that shot would always stay in bounds
of course you still had to get to the correct location in time which wasnt always easy
even if you hit  safe returns in a row your opponent even low level players would  of the time match you shot for shot until you got caught out of position and missed
to have a better chance of scoring you had to use a risk shot
for those you would again use the mouse to get into position then press and hold the spacebar press was or d which now brought up a meter to watch and hold till the indicator was in the top position
it moves very fast  oh and as mentioned before once you pressed your shot selection button the mouse now switches from moving the character to aiming your shot
in all i played about  games and was able to win only  timesthe time to uninstall the game was the longest i ever encountered
it made me wonder what it was doingin summary i could not recommend this game to anyone except the very best players
the controls are just way too difficult for average casual gamers
at least with a mouse and keyboardgranted i didnt pay a lot for this game but out of numerous games i bought lately this is the worst one
the menu system is aggravating as all get out
instead of just hitting enter to navigate the menus you use the arrows and the s and d keysbut to make it as inconsistent as possible at certain times in the game you do have to hit the enter key
want to hit the escape key to back out of menus
dream on
it does nothingand game play
imagine a real game of tennis between you and venus williams
now make a game out of you getting slaughtered by venus williamscall it top spin  and you are all set to go to marketi also bought it to play two player over a lan
i cant say that it doesnt work but i havent got it to work yetbut at least it has party games right
but they will only work with two game controllers attached to your pc
dont have two controllers and you cant even start them to see what they look likestill it isnt a horrible game and my kids are playing it as i write this
and i think taking the time to learn it better may improve my opinion of it
but there is nothing whatsoever intuitive about controlling your playeri think playing another person over a lan would be funner because both of you would be closer to the same skill level
i wonder if i will be able to get that to worktotally different game but at the same time i bought this i purchased virtual pool  it was about the same price and it is miles above top spin  in game play and i got it to work over a lan in a reasonable amount of timethough it is a bit tricky until you can figure it outthe great thing about this game are the options available
player creation coaches outfits are all very good
but i have to admit like the others have said the game takes a long time to load
first you have to load to get to the menu
that takes a while
then you have to load career
that takes longer
then you you have to load the tournamentwhich also takes a long time
aah finallythat is what you wanted to hear me say isnt it
noit is still not over yet
you now have to load the matchi have a very fast pc with a damn good graphics accelerator
still it takes such a long time to loadthere are graphic glitches as well
sometimes everything goes in slow motion or the screen freezes
it happens occasionally
and from what i know about tennis ball boys are supposed to pick up the ball when it hits the net which they dont
they just run leaving the ball where it is
it looks silly when they do that
one other reviewer mentioned that having the number  and number  player in the same draw is an inexcusable error
boy was that an understatement
i guess he was being nice
almost all the top players are put in one draw and the rest are put in the other
this is a mockery of tennisother major goof ups the whole attitude stuff after each point is silly and extremely irritating to say the least
watch some professional tennis matches and tell me which player does those stupid attitude things
this is not a popularity contest
this is tennis
no player i remember ever does the things they show in this game unless they are big time jerksthere are no replays which is not realistic
and as far as i can remember i have never seen anyone playing tennis with pants in grand slam events
it looks pathetic
this is the st century
not early s
the entire rival player idea is pathetic
the players rival loses in the first round of every tournament yet keeps rising up in the rankings rapidly
that is plainly impossible
and the stupid emails the rivals send make these players look like a bunch of yearolds getting at each other
there was no need for a rival scenario in the game
it just makes the game look ridiculously stupid
and in the real world a players major rival is almost always from a different country
federernadal edbergbecker grafselesso on
samprasagassi was one major exceptionbut the bottom line is it fun to play
it is if you can ignore the comments from your rival
less than  for this game is a reasonable price which is what is charged here
but the errors should make you think twice about buying this game for a higher price
tennis is definitely better however on many levels
tennis masters series by microids could have easily beaten this game as being the best out there
but what was lacking there were a lot options available in top spini have no idea how top spin  fares in comparison
but i can tell you that the makers of that game decided to isolate the pc gamers
but i cannot blame k for that entirely
this trend has been going on for a while
ea k and several gaming organizations are slowly doing away with the manufacture of pc games
that means the gaming users need to adapt and get the consoles
in other words unfortunately what medium we choose to entertain ourselves is governed by powerful organizations and this is no different in the gaming industry so we need to changeits a well made cable but it does not fit in the av input of the back of the ps slim model
beware buying thisim sorry to say but this has got to be the least fun pokemon game ive ever played
after i get through the bad stuff tho i will list some good stuff
so dont skip this reviewthe game is fun but personally i think the online aspect ruins it
you can get all sorts of stuff through trading that you usually wont be able to get too easily and i find that a tad annoying
plus the dialogue is terrible
its gotten extremely cheesy and at points i was shocked at how bad it is
the bad guy team in this game was also really annoying and the fact that half the members of it didnt seem to have a clue what was going on didnt help
theres also many new terrain types which are no fun at all such as snow fog and swamps
fog you cant see a darn thing when youre walking around and the only way to clear it is to use an hm move
i dont like to have to remove my good attacks to put really weak hm attacks on my pokemon just to get further in the game and this game seems to really emphasize hmsthe pokemon gyms have also turned into giant puzzles which take quite some time to figure out at times
while this is probably welcome for most people as it adds a new level of gameplay i personally prefer the walk in the room and beat up the leader approach of older games gymsbut what really killed it for me is the lack of stuff to do after you beat the game
i love being able to continue playing a game after i beat it and most pokemon games especially gold and silver have stuff to do afterwards
pokemon diamond and pearl do have stuff but it is incredibly boring
i continued playing for about  days after i beat it and got bored and stopped
i managed to get over  hours of gameplay out of pokemon ruby after i beat the elite 
i had about  hours of gameplay before i started over and it probably took  or less to beat the story modeif you dont mind this lack of fun after you beat the game then by all means get it
and if the ability to get almost anything in the game online appeals to you then you should probably already have this game
but i found those parts to be annoying so it is my least favorite in the seriesthis game is only for people that have never played pokemon before
only then will it be a decent game
if youve played pokemon before and just bought this because of all the new pokemon that came out and the new adventure etc etc if that was your reason then sorry to say but youve been dupped tricked conned fooled
nintendo game freak sure got you
im not bashing their name for nothing ill list you all the reasons why this idea is indeed based on somethingslap a new name on an old game
pokemon diamond is almost the same old game as when it first came out
being on the new ds you would expect it to at least upgrade its graphics and utilize the dss full potential more
the only differences are the towns look different pokemon attack you more different types of pokemon different types of people different bad guys more tms and hms
pokemon okay in this game there are even more pokemons for you to find andsometimes catch
but heres the low down if youre an analytical thinker
you see different types of pokemons right
but if you get to the basics of it are they really different or are they just the same old pokemons with a different look
nintendo ran out of ideas for pokemons decades ago so they go into the pictorial dictionary of our earthly creatures and make a caricature of it and slap a goofy name that sometimes relate to the animals real life nature ornotand call it a pokemon
they are so desperate to make up more pokemons that they brought in everything from dinosaurs to petshop animals to mystical creatures like dragons
its to the point where its almost ridiculous to look atpokemon in this game seem to attack you a lot more probably also based on ur abilities
playing this game would drive you completely nuts if you didnt carry a lot of repels which seems to be the only real thing that works to repel those obnoxious wild pokemons
sometimes you can take  steps and get attacked
think about it youre trying to solve a clue to get your way out of a cave and you get randomly attacked every  steps that you take
just take a minute out of ur day and think of that for a second and see how youll feel
buy some insurance for your ds because i almost broke minesi know cheating is bad but this game literally begs you to buy an action replay or other cheat device
why
because through half of the game they keep having you encounter the same small variety of pokemons
catchem all they say
how can you if  of the different types of pokemons almost throughout the game belong to a trainer
you can set up your team however you want but thats really limiting when you can only catch a handful of pokemon especially old pokemon from the first game even through half way in the game
what is really fun is to be able to raise a pokemon throughout the game
why would i want to find a legendary pokemon at lvl  when im practically done with the gamewhat i really really hate is how nintendo gives you a lot of pokemon like machop gasley abra in the beginning
theyre nice but they can only evolve to their final form by trading
that is sort of hard im  and i dont feel comfortable walking up to a little kid and be like hey do you want to trade pokemons with me
this is when a cop arrests me and i become a sex offender
im not crazy enough to play this online either
ds utilization okay the ds has a much better graphics engine on it so why not use it
pokemon diamond could have easily been done on the regular gameboy
use of the stylus
its okay but nothing extraordinary
sometimes its almost more convinient just using the buttons
dont expect a lot of interaction using the stylus its very badly incorporated into the game to the bare minimum almostgraphics remain pretty much d
for those of you that say dont fix whats not broken thats the kind of attitude that makes you sink lower back to the caveman era
dont fix it improve it
missions and plots same o same o old game with a new name indeed
missions are basically the same start in a town objective to be the best go beat gym leaders beat the elite four then battle tower etc afterwardsthe bad guys are back only difference is their name
everything is exactly the same
same with your rival
if you were starting to get sick of pokemon emeraldthis is almost the exact version so pick one and keep it
battling system exactly the freaken same
nintendo if you were going ot make the exact game and change it a little bit to trick a bunch of kids to buying your game and making you a lot of money at least make the pokemons moves look a lot cooler
the moves have a little more graphics in them but hardly anything worth mentioningthis is why i think if you bought this game and youve played pokemon before youve been ripped off real bad
what nintendo is doing is what the movie industry has been doing for a long time as well
add a little stuff add a little suspense on the release slap on a new name and boom gullible humans eating your trashget a flashcart everyone
you can put all your games on a memory card and play it on ur ds
saves you lots of moneythis is the only thing i can think of now but im pretty sure theres more complaints to be said
oh yeah you cant trade in your pokemon from your other pokemon games until much later when its almost uselessbe prepared to be pissed off when your pokemon that has a  based attack power and is  levels above a wild pokemon and still cant ko it with earthquake and its a normal effective move
thats how ridiculous it is and that pokemon has a  base def tooripp offevery once in a while a video game based on a movie comes out and it turns out to be a great game
but most of the time movie based games are full of generic and uninteresting gameplay and seem to do little more than plug the movie theyre based upon
this is one of those games pretty standard fare and just like the myriad of movie games youve played before only this time its johnny depps likeness and not that of some other hollywood heartthrobin the interest of fairness this game is not a total waste though its close
the combat is amusing for a minute or two mostly because jack thats who you begin the game as has some pretty cool animated counterattacks
but it gets tedious fast and pretty soon youre just mashing buttons in between yawns as you fend off another generic group of enemiesthis game does have a  player co op mode but from what i can tell you can only play a mission in co op if youve already completed it alone this may change later in the game
pirates also features a system of dueling which is as dull as the regular combat option
ive only played the ps version of this game but i assume the game was made to play on previous generation consoles like the ps and then just released as is on the ps as well because the graphics while not bad just dont seem worthy of the playstation in short at worlds end is just another generic video game based on a movie
if youre really a pirates fan i guess you could rent iti doubt the game would hold your interest longer than the rental period anywaymovie based video game tieins are traditionally not very good and fantastic four rise of the silver surfer is no different
pretty much following the plot of the film ff rise of the silver surfer allows you to play as marvels first family in this derivative beat em up as you embark on a mission to take down the silver surfer dr doom and save the planet
if you played the first game based on the first film or any other licensed beat em up for that matter you already know what to expect here
the graphics are really bland and the game itself is easy to quickly breeze through as well
besides taking down hordes of enemies youll have mission objectives like unlocking doors and the like all of which becomes boring very very quickly and the beat em up action itself isnt done all that well either
you can switch between the ff but there arent many overall differences between the team members besides their main abilities
not to mention and heres what really bothered me for a game thats supposed to follow the story of the movie its based on just where is galactus
considering the role the planet eating monster played in the film as well as the comic that inspired all of this in the first place his absence is inexcusable
all in all fantastic four rise of the silver surfer is nowhere near as good or as fun as activisions xmen legends or marvel ultimate alliance series of games both of which you are much better off with than this derivative cashinimpulse buy and my god was it a bad onei liked the movies but this was just and awkward clumsy linear adventure game with nearly no depthif you have played one generic action adventure youve played this onecollect pointless collectables engage in mindnumbing combat and complete some sword based minigamesgraphics are uncanny and nothing looks quite right
they push jack sparrows quirks very hard and nearly every animation looks stilted and forcedi suppose if you are a huge fan or young you may find this game fun but man sold this very soon after playing it for pennies at gamestopive bought some cheap and bad games in my day but wow
really this is the crappiest game i have ever bought
i finished it but was contastantly reminded how lame the gameplay was all the way through the game
if you want to try a cheap game like this one that is good get conan for a few buckswow
i was hoping this game wouldnt be as bad as people said
it really sucks
no fun at all
pretty to look at on my pbut thats it
funfactor   glad i only paid  for it
in a nutshell if youre under  yrs old you will love this game
if not spit on it
what a wasteheres a game for which i had high expectations
but overall the experience was rather underwhelmingthere are some known problems with this game in vista no sound and no fullscreen
perhaps this is a joke on the part of the programers but the way i was able to fix it ingame is to actually turn sound off turn fullscreen offyou start by surviving a plane crash
the fire on the water looks very nice
then you swim to a lighthouse and take an elevator down
now youre taken to the underwater city of rapture where a character convinces you to fight against the ruler of the city
the voice acting is absolutely superb
the story is overall good
i found that there are too many characters though
there are some twists in the story and surprises
there are also too many goals to accomplish theres the main goal of the story the minor goals of each mission and two additional overall goals of collecting souls and blood so to speak
then there are the tasks of upgrading weapons and yourself
one of the twists i found particularly touching and that is who you become toward the end
and that splits this game really into two as your character changes dramatically and graphically for the worst
im surprised they didnt leave the second part for a sequel
this game is somewhat longi was not all that impressed with the graphics
sure theres some neat water effects but its overdone
and i didnt find that the overall look was all that impressive
but i really disliked the style of this game
some people like that sort of thing i didnt the art deco retro style
then theres that aweful music from the s or so
the cartoonish aspects are kind neat and in that regard the game has a lot of personality
i also dislike the darkness of the settings
ever since doom i all action games have emphasized darkness and its tiringbut its really the gameplay that is disappointing
as a shooter this game is just horrible
ill grant that the movement of the enemies is neat they jump and flip and crawl on the ceiling
but shooting at them is not at all fun
neither is constantly picking up stuff and listening to long monologues
theres only so much fun in pressing the e button every other second
the mechanical weapons are boring the biological ones more interesting
youll mostly walk through hallways or corridors as opposed to large expanses which is what one would expect of a recent game
i didnt like most of the scenes wharf rotten garden which does become nice once you save it theaters lots of rooms hospital rooms etc quite a bit of variety
but they are all dark and dulllooking which nullifies all the variety
gameplay itself and graphics dont make it very immersivei rate it high in personality and audio but poor in graphics entertainment value and replayabilitythen theres of course all the annoying security features that companies make us pay for and that limits what we can do with the game for which we paidthis game is sexy
no one can argue that factsadly it has a lot of performance issues
yes yes my dear fanboys i realize my computer is causing the performance issues
choose to believe or dont but i have a top of the line computer
save your money on the pc version and buy an xbox  and bioshock it will be more expensive but a hell of a lot more enjoyable installs means no reformatting no installing it on your future computers i think  owners should go with that version as i have both but have yet to install this on my pc i will play the  version because i feel like i actually own what i paid for and the  stars is for each install if i ever botherbioshock is very difficult to use and understand and play
he gets stuck in a room filled with fire and cant escapebioshock  is kind of a mixed bagit is an extension of the same reasonably coherent storyline from the firstit sports many of the same magnificent graphics  voice acting sound effects and weapons from  bs and whereas bs had the annoying habit of overwhelming the player with  superfluous sound and music effects at the most inopportune moments  bs has managed to tone it down somewhatbut in that effort perhaps they went a little too far
in the first game the vending machines had a voice attraction that while annoying and amusing served to lend flavor to the s motiff the game was built aroundthey were removed from bs perhaps as a result of player complaints  i dont know
i noted their absence though but it didnt impact gameplay
the telekenisis augment from the first game  was fun to play with and in fact was my primary weaponmy all time favorite kill ever was where i beat the crap out of a bigdaddy using nothing but a salami in bs no wonder they groan like a whale
who wants to get clobbered to death by lunchmeat
bs telekenisis skill seems a little lackingit could just be me but its not as fun as in  however in  you played as a bigdaddya bigdaddy that is almost as weak as the splicers you slog througha bd is supposed to be a tank and one of the augments you can obtain is  drill specialistyou trade off access to all weapons except drill and  plasmids in exchange for drastic reduction in eve consumptionwith that available i didnt miss telekinesis all that much
my combo of choice was level  freeze and the  drill with all the power to the people augmentsthough it is a beautiful game to look at and listen to and playing it is fun and absorbing it does have issuesfirst id like to say that i have two computers  a work horse for day to day activites and a monster alienware beast for gamming only
i dont even look at email with that one
bs requires a windows live account to play to me its not a great issueso faras its installed on a singlepurpose machine and the account is plain and anonymousnevertheless you must be looged in to save your gamei looged out apparently mid session and wound up playing almost half the game in a single sitting beacuse i couldnt saveone moment i could and next i couldntthat really sucked all the more so because in this day and age where tech companies are writing the future for all mankindand theyre writing with their own bottom line as being their only guidebook you get shameless and agressive greed for your marketable information coupled with a indifference to their own incompetance and how it negatively impacts their customersall day long you can read about peoples disgust with software antipiracy gobbledygook but all that disgust leads to nothinglike i said so far im doing okay with a dedicated game computer but if youre using a multipurposed system things like windowslive can be gross and offensive
i  got steam on my alienware and dont know how windows live will effect its operationall that aside bs is better imo but only a little by a bit and bs is worth every single cent
just prepare to cope with corprate infogreedmy husband and i are gamers and love great gamesplayed manyand this one oddly since there is so much about it that would make you think it is greatand it is not
we tried to figure this out but the one thing we came up with is regardless of the reviews it was awful
repetitive if you like that buy this game
it was a surprising disappointmentconsidering all the reviewsdidnt make sense
oblivion ran true to reviews even older ones like morrowindand many others
bioshock no way
despite trying to even go along with some of the reviews about it being fantastic we just cant
it just didnt win us over at allto be honest this game has great graphics and interesting game play
the first levels are really scary exciting and interesting
but the game quickly becomes tedious
basically i played this game a couple of hours a day for about a week i just couldnt take much more than that at a sitting
near the end it was pure tedium
some of the voice acting was great and funny
i liked dr schulong but i found the exposition provided by the tapes you find to be trite at best
i kept thinking he wouldnt have stopped to carve aaaahhhhhgggggg
honestly why would the people in the game record their inner most thoughts and secrets
unlikely at best
compare this to hl where the exposition is through the environment and i find the storytelling in hl to be much better accomplished
bioschock was too compressed too much voice over exposition
it makes you always feel claustraphobicthe twist in the game was cleverly donechance i will replay this game without becoming really annoyedthis game plays very well
there were no problems even though i bought it used
i am not a fan of the game it self though i play a lot of similar games dead space fallout series mass effect series and many sandbox rpg action games
but this one never peaked my interest
the story was very boring and the controls left a lot to be desired
being forced to stay in st person shooter mode gave me headache after while and didnt allow me to play the game for long stretches of time
the achievements were also kind of tedious and didnt increase my enjoyment of the game
unlike most games i didnt care how it ended and i really just wanted it to be over as quickly as possible
i wouldnt recommend the gamebased somewhat on the film and somewhat on the comics fantastic four rise of the silver surfer finds the super powered family fighting an army of skrulls rock monsters doombots and some other robots to find the silver surfer so he can save the world from galactusso the story is crap
the writing is crap i cringed as the invisible woman complained about her wedding plans throughout the first stage
the gameplay tended to feel repetitive as the main objective is to go into a room smash all the bad guys and move on the next room and smash all the bad guys
the only bit of challenge comes with figuring out which fantastic fours powers unlocks the door to allow you to move on to the next room johnnys fireballs invisible womans force bubble things fists or mr fantastics electric glove thingynot the best game but i could imagine a younger player having a ball
definitely not the kind of game you want to play through for more than  mins to an hourif you like watching animated movies especially foreign asian animation you might like this game because that is what you do in jade empire
if you like some good button mashing and then watching cutscene after cutscene after cutscene then this might be the game for you
i like some cutscenes in my games but too many will take me out of the immersion factor
also the graphics in jade empire just feel cartoonyyour character fights scripted linear enemies and then triggers another cutscene
then your silent voiced character will have choices of dialog to select from leading eventually down the path of good or evil
once you choose your dialog you continue to the next cutsene
i just couldnt get into this game no matter how hard i triedthe lighting is dim  and you cant turn it up
the software included is the most confusing least userfriendly of its type i have ever seen mind you i am comparing to the logitech keyboard software which is really quite good
the keys are mushy
theres no mute buton why
the wrist pad has a goofy attachement setup to the keyboard  within  minutes of having it out of the box i broke the positioning tabs many others have had this same problem  otherwise i would have sent it back to amazon
it has this large clossy black bar maybe  inches deep across the top with no discernible function whatsoever except to make the unit much bigger than it needs to beall in all i hate this keyboard
just hating it is not the reason for the bad review though the rating is based on the fact that it has so many deisgn and user feature flaws
i dont give it a  because it actually does workoh and be warned this product isnt even listed on the manufacturers website in their product list which indicates it has been supercededmy logitech g which will replace my coffee destroyed logitech g first gen arrives today and this one goes to my sonthe seller was expressmedia
i paid  bucks
it worked fine on my pc running windows xp home spthe graphics and sound effects are okaythe voice acting is poor and annoying
talk to me siryoull hear that a lot from your squad they should talk less and fire more
and then there is the sexuallyseductive sounding way that your teammate tells you way to go captainafter you make a good shot
yuck
it made me feel creepy
and there is similar weird sounding dialogue coming from your teamthe ai your team is poor interacting with your squad is cumbersome
i found it easiest to tell my entire team to just follow me but they routinely get stuck somewhere
the enemy ai is okaythe middle mouse button is reserved for squad commands so dont reassign that mouse button to another key
the middle mouse button is not listed in the onscreen controlskey mapping i found it in the game manual
who reads the manual anymore
it should all be in the options menuconfigurable or notwant to crouch
hit c  hit c again to go prone
want to stand up
hit v to go from prone to crouch
hit v again to stand all the way up
and there is a third key to go from stand to prone and back
really
just give me one key to standcrouchpronei didnt find a way to take coverjust need to crouch behind something but crouch is not much different than standingi felt like it was a runandgun gamenot much strategy needed
just head toward the goal and kill targets along the wayim playingtom clancys splinter cell chaos theoryright now and it is much better not squad based and you can explore a bit be stealthy or not kill or just incapacitate the enemy it has more of a story and the voice acting is much betteri played the first and second acts in graw but i got bored with the gameit just wasnt fun
i figured i would try to finish the game using god mode but thats not easily available
so i stopped playing and im glad i did since chaos theory is much better and id rather play it instead
ill sell grawvisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionsjust the feel of the game being unfinshed
lots of coding errorssingle player not that exciting
story is not that goodi have not play a sub sim game since a game called i attack sub for sega genesis after watching many videos on this game i decided to get this as a start off instead of going straight for silent hunter  needless to say i was very excited to download this game
and i even watched the video when it cam on
the i got into the menu and changed some things visually
so i was ready and clicked on the tutorial sub school
this is not what a tutorial is about
if you wanted people to learn things on their own then this is definitely a tutorial for them
i would have rated this game higher had there been a tutorial but i have given up on learning how to play
good thing it was only takes a very long time to downlaod even with high speed internet
no tutorial very long learning curve gets very monotimious after a short period
would not recommendthe singleplayer seems to work just fine
but when i try to play a multiplayer match it tells me that my cd key is not valid
anyone else having similar issues
it was a complete headache to get it installed spent hours trying this and that and finally got it done with eas online chat support
looks like i will have to go back onto that to see if i can get this new issue solvedi bought battlefield  quite some time back but found air power to be frustratingly overpowered
antiair defenses are a joke and it didnt take long for good helicopter and jet pilots to learn how to utterly dominate the game
being a fan of ground fighting i put the game on a shelf and decided to check back in a couple of years to see what had changedfast forward to last spring when i bought this pack with all the expansions
bad news nothings changed regarding air power
its still a joke to do anything but hop in a cockpit
good news playing on maps without air power at all was a new found joy
take out the helicopters and the game becomes playable for the full range of infantry to tank to dune buggy
bad news the new expansions dont add much
the new maps are mostly mediocre and thus go unplayed overall
worse news the player base is largely a bunch of basement dwelling asshats who think video games are serious business and  year olds with add
worst news the game is now riddled with hacking
blatant even humorously so
i can deal with the  jeeps suddenly falling from the sky at once and blowing up half a square mile at least thats kinda funny but the jerks who hang out making impossible shots over and over with aim hacks to crank up their  online stats are the real game killer
because as we all know being the rd ranked player out of  in an online game is an accomplishment worth dogged pursuitthe game can still be fun but searching for a server not completely ruined by hacks or just generally nasty players made the game more trouble than it was worth once the novelty wore off
as hacking is already bad and will likely only continue to get worse i cant highly recommend the game
thats a shame because its a darn good game overall despite some frustrating imbalances in air powerthe game worked fine and its a lot of funthe problem is that it doesnt include euro forces and armored furyi tried to contact a lot of peopleno one helpedamazonnot their problemeadidnt answertried downloading  patches as it was indicated online that i needed them to get euro forces and armored furyit didnt workpretty much a waste of timefor everyone around who is not aware selling a product and claiming that its something that its not its illegalwe could all sue if we cared that much but we dontamazon never indicated that we had to download a patch or anything of the sort to get the whole gamethats what im angry aboutbf is a great game some small flaws but a great game
special forces is a pretty good addon
armored fury and euroforce do not add very much to the gameplay but installing them is a hit or miss proposition
from my recent last couple of days  experience ea does not have a reliable method to register the booster pack addons so that you can play them
the number of other owners who also have this problem and are getting little to no help from ea is quite large
i was lucky after using the right information over a period of four hours i was finally able to register and play the addons but the registration process is not reliable the same information that allows the registration of the game might not the first several times you trythis pack is a good value for bf and bfsf but the installation procedure for the booster packs is amateurish and should have been done reliably
if future games are released with this type of registration i will either return them or never buy them in the first placethis is a strange game
i guess i never tried a racing game where the story line was the main thing and the driving was secondary
im too dense to have  different controls to run the game thats why i stick to racing games
this one is too complicated
theres controller assignments in driving walking visual and menu modes
too much for me
i spent more time on the controls than playing the game and some stuff i couldnt find the answer to like how to answer messages
i just didnt like the game
i would rather try racing games where its all about racing not all about a bedtime storyit is great to run people down though but its too easy no fun after a few timesits sad
this game had a lot of potential and a lot of potential for sales
a lot more care should have went into making thisbasically you play the ds as if you were playing a guitar
kind of
you can select chords from a huge variety of chords and assign them to the different directional buttons
there is a bar across the touch screen and you strum across that with the stylus as if it were a pick
you can save songs and you can use to mic to record your voice along with the guitar stuff
theres also a few effects that sound awful
its best to leave them alonethere is no career mode to speak of
theres just a set list of under  songs
no difficulty settings eithertheres pretty much nothing to speak of graphically either
you can change the color of the bar in the middle of the screen and you can change the background colora career mode slightly higher quality sound and more songs just might have been enough to save this title
as it is now i wouldnt even say its worth renting
just get a real guitar
dont get me wrong i love gh and rock bandwell first things first this is the same game as for the pc but they donw graded so much its terrible you cant kck people down stair cases and that was the best part of the game kicking people down stair cases loli have already bought the pc collection edition so maybe that will be better on the pc
ill first tell you overall how i felt the game was before i got stuck
its a bit cheesy
not japanese anime rpg cheesy but oh i get a staff yippee cheesy
the melee system is pretty bad
other reviewers bash oblivion for having repetitive combat
yes thats repetitive but this is really bad
block attack bash and kick them
wait for your stamina to go up while you block again then bash and kick them again
repeat  times per enemy
this is s rpglevel melee
the lightining indoors is horrible and yes you have infravision but that just makes everything distorted and uneven light texture
i think that in trying to make the game different than oblivion they ended up with quirks that do not contribute positively to the game
they just should have made a solid easy to play game no matter what the management and polls suggested
i dont like the combat spell system and inventory system in general not horrible but certainly not easy to use when you need to use it
anyway i got stuck on chapter  inside the one building that connects to the necromancers gate
two different walkthroughs told me to go to the door at the top of the lefthand stair and open it
guess what it has a red jammed key in it and will not open
so i go back a few saves and look at the door
still locked
will not open
no chapter  for me
no finishing the game
maybe you will get a game that doesnt have this glitch maybe not
now that im thinking about it let me put on xbox live and see if there are any online patches
still though this is ridiculous that there is a terrible glitch in the first few hours of gameplayyoud think cute puppies and youd think a game for little kids right
youd be wrong
first be prepared to sit there and read pages and pages and pages of stuff to your young child  every screen is packed with reading
second many of the themes are a bit scary
for instance you have to go to dog island to find a way to save a sibling from dying of a disease
great
then there are nasty things like snakes oh great thanks for working my childs phobia there folks hiding aroundmainly my  year old son just got bored
it didnt do enough for himkind of boring after the first  levels or so
too often there are too few contiguous blocks to get any matches making it impossible until you clear all matchable combos else whare and the board resets and you just hope it comes up with matchable combos in the problem area
boring
and when multiple corner stones drop sometimes they block each other making it impossible to match under them to cause them to drop
boring
and if the board is small making match  or  is nearly impossible and no strategy just luck so getting those bonus pieces necessary to finish the level is impossible
poor match  gamei wasnt a big fan of the burnout series
i tried to like this game
i just wanted a causal racing game that didnt involve power ups
people were telling me to buy the game but when i did i wanted my money backgraphics sound controls  music are great
cant complain about that
the gameplay is what i didnt like
to much emphases on getting a power meter for super speed and hitting cars
the computer would always beat me many times
even when i put the game on easy mode
i felt frustrated and couldnt take it anymoreif your a fan of the burnout series pick it up
for casual racing fans you probably will want to skip this and go somewhere elseas other reviewers here have noted this is more akin to burnout lite than a real burnout game
i dont know what ea was thinking to release a burnout game without the crash mode but thats what they did and its not worth the  price
if youre skeptical rent it firsti think youll conclude that this is the weakest of the sequels
note also that the game does not support old analog wheels or ps controllersanother really bad decision by ea
supposedly theyre making the real burnout  for the ps
but given this sorry ripoff it wont be a reason for me to spend my money on a new consolei bought this game today thinking it would be awesome
turns out its the worst wii game ive played
it only took me about  hours to beat and it was boring the whole way through
i played through red steel which was waaay more fun than this
if you want a first person shooter for the wii this isnt itmedal of honor vanguard isnt a good medal of honor game
its ok at best
i consider mod rising sun to be the worst
vanguard has a great story and voice overs but the gameplay is whats hurts the game
many times when you shoot at the nazis they either take a lot of hits or the bullets go right through them
hit detection is poor
also upgrading weapons is rare and can only upgrade one weapon at a time
you cant even take that upgraded weapon into the next levelthe graphics are also poor
if you have a led tv it will be dark and muddy
few levels are at night so you better raise the settings
most areas are generic at best and nothing really stands outthe levels are short
there are three difficulty settings
only the last two levels are really hard and frustrating regardless if the game is on easy
the enemies come in waves and you have to hold them off for a couple of minutes
in one level you have to deal with snipers but because the graphics are poor they are very hard to see
this game can be beaten in a few hoursthere is multiplayer for two to four players but why bother
you and your friends will get bored rather quicklyoriginally mod vanguard was priced at  when the game was release
typical ea
the game was meant to be a companion disc to medal of honor airborne for pcif you looking for a good medal of honor game for you playstation  buy european assault
this game is a waste of time and moneyat first i enjoyed the game i only got to the first part though because after a while it stopped working i am not sure it its the game or the ps but the car wont turn
i play other games perfectly fine so i doubt its my ps my friends and i tried to fix it maybe i pressed something but nothing the car wont turn it just goes straight so i obviously stopped playing it and cant tell if the game was any goodthis is kind of a kids game to me
nothing particularly interesting going on but still a nice sandbox style racing game similar to midnight club la  driving is easy as pie opponents are rubber banding around me in traditional racing game fashion and stunt jumps are a dime a dozen
after a little while i lost interest even though i had set out to at least jump through every billboard because ive always wanted an achievement for billboard destructionwhat i dont liked about the game was that youre in an unreal city
i like gran turismo cause you compete on real locations
the other thing i didnt like is that youve to use many unrealistic things like the turbo function in order to win and not your real skill as a pilottry grid racing game which i think is betterway way too many screen options before i could just start racing is very very frustratingonly  car and  motorcycle the rest have to be bought online stop nickel and dime mei didnt grow up with muscle cars mostly rice burner carsawesome crash scenesif youre looking for a racing simulator or even a driving simulator you should look somewhere else because you wont find it in burnout paradise
this game is more like a dumbeddown erated grand theft auto than it is a racing simulator
if thats what you want then this is the game for you
but be warned this is a juvenile game with very little sense of realism at all
the city is pretty well rendered and its kind of a hoot to drive around crashing into other vehicles there are no people anywhere in this game and watching the slowmo crackup footage
but after youve done this a few times it gets old
once youve explored the city and crashed your way through a bunch of the socalled events  really phony races against cartoonishacting opponents  theres not much else happening herebottom line rent this if youre bored but dont expect it to entertain you for long enough to justify buying itone technical note my old logitech racing wheel doesnt work with this game
it works with gt prologue but burnout paradise ignores iti really wanted to like burnout paradise
the graphics are beautiful the soundtrack is fantastic with a few exceptions  avril lavigne
 and online play is integrated well
its obvious that the developer was going for a seamless play experience  load times are pretty much nonexistent
however the cost in implementing this system is that simple commands like retrying a race or swapping cars is gone
annoyingly after losing a race youll find yourself having to either move on or trudge back to the start of that particular event
another problem is that many of the events require a specific car or a specific class here again youll have to find a junk yard and swap out your car
i also noticed while playing that all of the events conclude at one of eight predetermined points and while youre free to choose a path of your liking there are realistically only so many optimal routes to race
unfortunately with the sandbox environment youll find yourself relying on maps a lot
the game has a great map  but you have to pause the action and go to a different screen to use it
the minimap that you get while driving is essentially useless as you only see a small portion of the total map
i found that id usually start a race only to immediately pause the game and study the map for a route
then along the way id pause a few more times to stay on track
annoying
winning cars in paradise is actually pretty cool  many times you first have to find a rival and take them out in order to win their car
whats unexplainable is why the developer chose to give you a damaged car that has to be immediately repaired after selecting it
get used to driving to the repair shop often
all in all burnout paradise couldve been the pinnacle of the series as it stands poor choices by the developer in a few areas keeps the game from being great
ultimately the game is enjoyable especially for anyone new to burnout for veterans the shortcomings will be all to obviousthis game is so painfully flawed
ive been a burnout fan for a long time and sadly this one doesnt have what it takes
visually this game is amazing
it gets  stars there
but thats the only really good thing about itat the title screen you have to deal with the horrible take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
song
stabs his ears out  then you have to deal with it while the game loads
then you have to deal with it when you select and customize your car
then you have to deal with it on ea trax
thanks guys
couldnt find a more annoying songsecondly you cannot customize the controller
at all
yeah we all like having to switch our play for the one freaking game that doesnt allow for customizationthird theres no reset option mid race
im a perfectionist and if i screw up where i dont want to ill reset a race
but not on this game
oh ho no
i have to go all the way to the end of the race then drive all the way back to the beginning because this burnout utilizes the map race layout like other games in this genre as opposed to a structured race setup but does a horrible job of it
theres no way to warp back to a race youve already attempted you get to drive alllll the way back and stew on your miserable defeatfourth theres no way to turn off the extra camera for when you take someone down named takedown camera in other versions it always goes to the opposing car
at least this could be shutoff in other burnouts
not this one
no no no  ea worked so hard in making these crashes they demand every moment of your attention on themthe stunt run is  okay
its very hard if youre not familiar with the area
if youre lucky enough to find a jump or series of jumps back to back just keep using themand lastly  the one thing every burnout fan liked wasnt included in this game
what is it you ask
the crash mode
no crash mode
yup
bad move ea
way to take a brilliant game and butcher it until it was just another need for speed
yes i know about showtime mode and its somewhat fun to play around with  however it doesnt top the structured crash mode of this games predecessors
i had very high expectations for this game and was seriously let down
id give the game  stars but since i cant it only gets   its definitely not a three star gamei hate this game
i cannot express in words the degree to which i hate this game
if this game were a person i could run it down with my car and not feel the slightest twinge of ethical concern
i hate it so much it leads me to forget things that ive been trained to know are right and good and simply shout expletives in its general direction for the next few hundred words
fortunately for this game im not quite that much of a jerkimagine that you took test drive unlimited and the last decent burnout title smashed them together and then carefully excised everything even remotely fun from the mangled monstrosity that resulted
there my friend you have found burnout paradise
everything about revenge that entertained me enough to keep from snapping the disc in half and tossing it into traffic has been removed from this game and i cant in good conscience recommend it to anybodyone thing that i cant fault the game for is its appearance which is certainly a step up
the game is definitely beautiful
driving through paradise city you get to see a lot of different environments and every single one springs off the screen and directly into your face like some kind of carnivorous monster
when it comes to useful visuals for the gameplay however theres some problems with the level of detail included in the games environments  specifically i have a hard time figuring out where the bloody road turns in some locations
this is worst in the downtown areas and best on the outskirts of town but any time i miss my turn because it doesnt look like theres a road there at all somebody needs to yell at the graphical designerthe game sound is mostly unremarkable so lets not
it wont make you physically angry and i guess that you might like the soundtrack i personally loathed roughly  of the included music but thats not atypical for me with an ea title but its not going to pleasure you sexually or make you reevaluate your lifemy problems with the game all have to do with the gameplay or rather the lack thereof
if youve played revenge you might remember fun modes like traffic attack or crash mode
those were pretty terrific right
well theyre gone
not only are they gone but some of the fundamental rules that you would have learned from prior games in the series have been utterly invalidated
the big one is the rules on what kind of traffic causes crashes
in revenge they had a simple rule  if you could see headlights or it was a truck you would wreck into it
otherwise you knock it to the side
i dont know what they replaced that with but i do know that in the first hour i played i wrecked against no fewer than ten cars stopped at intersections smaller than me facing away from meof greater concern is the bald stupidity that comes from building an open world street racing game in a world that nobody has ever been to
if this game were set in san marcos tx id be all over it because i know where those streets are
i dont know where anything is in this game and the game doesnt do anything at all to help you learn
im faced as a newcomer with the choice between spending ten hours losing hard just to learn where everything is not fun and just plain losing because i dont know where anything is also not fun
closed tracks are fun because its hard to get lost
i got lost in three of my first ten events in this game and ended up on practically the wrong side of town
thats badi could go on for a thousand more words but i wont belabor my point too heavily
the game has been well received and maybe its just me
maybe people who like open world style games will find something to enjoy here
i didnt
i found test drive to be a better implementation of the idea
with limited modes that mostly feel identical no crash mode seriously  crash mode was a puzzle game and that was fun showtime is entirely random undirected gameplay poor layout and any number of other problems this game would have to come with chocolate cake and my own personal supermodel before i would even consider recommending it
theres a lot of potential for an open world burnout game but this isnt the game to realize that dreamfirst off ive played burnout  and burnout revenge so i have some experience with past games
somehow they managed to mess up a good thing as after playing this for about an hour or so i was already frustrated
instead of just picking events you want to play you have to drive around to the one you want
 considering how huge the map is its more frustrating then fun
 a lot of times i lost races just because of glare from the sun yes i have no idea why theyd put glare in the game
honestly id just play burnout  or revenge theyre more fun than this game will ever bei preordered this game and played it as soon as it arrived
im a huge fan of all the previous burnout series theyre just so awesome and fun to play
this game right off the go has great graphics and music is ok but this game is a big letdownreason  no split screen
so if you want to play multiplayer its on either xbox live or lan with another xbox
you cant do split screen like the previous gamereason  the menu system is totally confusing and though it looks cooler graphically the interface is counterintuitivereason  not as fun as theyve changed some of the dynamics of the game physics ie crashing into the rear of cars at higher speeds etc
theyve made things a bit more realistic as in actual damage rather than allowing me to just plow through at any speeds and suchreason  did i already mention no split screen
i think i got the most fun out of playing it with someone else right next to me like takedown racestwo stars overall because first person is still fun but the fact that multiplayer has been greatly reduced to nothing dropped the rating down big time
i went back to playing burnout revengegood rental game but i jumped on the preordering bandwagon because of the previous successes with the burnout seriesi bought burnout paradise because of how much i like burnout  and burnout revenge
everyone i talked to just loved this game
now when i popped this game in my  i was taken away with the nice graphics and the speed and flow of the game was great
but after spending about thirty minutes playing the game i realized it is more frustrating than fun
if you dont care about endlessly crashing and losing than you will have fun with this game
i dont like the open world aspect to the game because it is very difficult to hit your turns when you constantly have to look at a bad map while going at full speed
the desicion to force the gamer to rely on a map really hurts this game
it reminds me of another game called midnight club on the ps which had terrible gameplay
this game is very dissapointing and now i have to go back to gamestop and get back my copy of burnout revengeas said in other reviews nintendo offers little support for this
the idea is if you dont have a wireless modem or router but do have an internet connection ie
via a wired dsl modem or broadband modem you can use this device to connect your ds ds lite dsi and i suppose ds not sure to the internet via your computers usbthe problem is it doesnt always work and it is very expensive new
if you do purchase one of these buy it used and cheap so if you dont have luck with it you dont waste a lot of money
it doesnt matter if it comes with the disk you can get the drivers off of nintendos website the last i knew
beyond that though nintendo offers no support for the device
a shame since it is a good ideai dont think this works with vista or  not sure about mac only tried on xp
if you do buy a device like this however i do recommend that you buy this one the one made by nintendo  i tried another device from a rd party company that was supposed to do the same thing and it was complete junk
the software didnt work the hardware was shoddy it felt like the device was going to fall apartnintendos wifi usb connector is a simple device that turns your pc into a wifi hub for your nintendo wii and nintendo ds to connect to the internet
the installation is quick and the unit just plugs into your computers usb port
the connection itself seems relatively secure and is especially nice for pcnovices
the software installation is simple and only takes a few minutesunless it doesnt
then youre just out of lucknintendo does not offer a lot of support for this device and if it doesnt work well theyre sorry but theres not a lot they can do
at the time of this writing the device had the following issues it doesnt work with the zonealarm firewall
at all
period
in order for the device to work you have to completely uninstall zonealarm not just turn it off
other firewalls may also cause problems
there is no planned fix for this at the time of this writing it doesnt work with windows vista
nintendo may or may not be working on a fix for this the device gets hot when plugged in
not just a little warm but downright uncomfortable to the fingers
i havent heard of any of them catching on fire but it is a bit disturbingso if you do not use zonealarm do not use another firewall are not disturbed by a warm object sticking out of your computer and do use windows xp this device will probably work well for you
otherwise find an gcompliant wireless wifi router for your pc and hook it up for better resultsedit  dec  nintendo has released new software for the wifi connector
the program is almost twice as big as the previous version and is supposed to work with vista
while i cant vouch for the vista aspect other reviewers however have said they got it to work i can report that the new version still is not compatible with many firewalls including zonealarm
still the changes make this nintendo connector a valid option for many gamers that want online play but that couldnt use the device previously  it is definitely a step in the right direction by nintendoi purchased this when i still was using a dsi
most official nintendo devices and merchandise are fairly well made however this is an exception
im assuming that regardless of ear size shape or set the design of this item is universally bad
it offers no variables to adjust to the contour of ones ear the earpiece simply flips out on a hinge and clips on the ear by closing that hinge
to boot although it is not large it feels bulky and uncomfortablethe microphone works fairly well but offers no adjustment
you are better off using a set of headphones and speaking into the on board microphone than spending money on this shoddy piece of merchandisezack snyders big screen adaptation of frank millers  was a smash hit so naturally a video game adaptation seemed inevitable
 march to glory follows spartan king leonidas and his small army of spartan warriors as they take on the invading persian army
while  features some great sound effects music blood effects and overall style its ultimately empty in the gameplay department
at its core  is a generic hack  slasherclumsy beat em up featuring a horde of recurring enemies and moments where youll attain some special abilities to spice things up
the graphics are stiff jerky and dont really do a whole lot to push the power of the psp while the voice work featured throughout even though david wenham is the only cast member from the film to be featured in the game is excellent as well
the jerky camera stiff animation and the unimaginitive and lame combat system are what really hurts  as a whole though which is sad because the game could have been something pretty good had more time been put into its development
that being said if youre a fan of the  film or graphic novel or you just want to play a quick hack  slash on the go for your psp  march to glory is worth checking out but in the end though its better left on the shelfdiner dash first achieved notoriety as a flash game and now its hit the ds as well
taking everything that made it enjoyable before diner dash starts out as a blast but the overall repetitiveness and simplicity are what hurt diner dash the most in the long run
playing as flo diner dash offers some challenging gameplay as you attempt to run your frequently busy restaurant
however the game doesnt look quite right squeezed down to the ds small screen not to mention offering some slight frame rate issues as well
not to mention that once you do get through the entire game and you will there isnt any reason to go back again
what really saves the ds version of diner dash from the scrap heap though are the inventive touch screen and stylus controls that have been implemented as well as the overly fun and addictive multiplayer options
the good mostly outweighs the bad with diner dash but the worst factor is undoubtedly the fact that you can find this game for the pc for much cheaper than the asking price here
still though if you desire diner dash on the go youll be pretty well satisfied for a while anyway that isive always been a fan of lara croft
oddly though never been a huge fan of tomb raider
the game play is a crawlbalancemove away from identical
the camera is dizzying that quickly leads to just plain old annoying
lara is still a great icon to move around but the pedestal of memory has faded
i dont regret visting the familiar simply for nostalgias sake but failed to realize there may be consequencesafter beating tomb raider underworld i thought id give the ps versions a shot and i am one of the few who didnt like this game
the controls feel unresponsive when you have to make quick moves
the trex boss battle was enough for me to quit
you cant dodge the guy very well
you are running backwards shooting trying to get him to charge into some spikes that you cant see behind you
i rarely just give up on a game but playing a boss battle for hours and not getting past that point ceases to be funfirst of all i want to thank the people who sent this game within  days
thank you i was suprised how fast this arrived in the mail
i was also suprised how much i did not enjoy this stuff pack
i thought i was getting more hairstyles but they only had five that were wedding styles
its ok if you like your sims getting married and having birthday parties but other than that you can past
this stuff pack is not necessarily needed for your sims  enjoyment
i suggest hm fashion
actually i suggest any stuff pack that does not have secrom
anyway thank you guys once againi think that the sims have gone overboard
they are trying to cash in on what some great designers have done on the internet
seriously you would be better off giving your  to some sims website that creats housesclothinghairetc
this expansion is a waste
time and moneyi will the would create something original for the game
they keep leashing out the same expansions that they did for sims that they are issuing for the sims
something original would be niceso here we are again with a new stuff pack initially priced at 
ive seen the screenshots and while it all looks neat theres not enough of it to make it worth that price
sorry amazon but even your sale price of  isnt enough to tempt me
theres all kind of free fan sites out there like modthesims with tons of downloads
theres also pronup sims for beautiful wedding attire and accessories
do your research have a good antivirus program stick with reputable fan sites pay attention to what and how you download and you wont crash your game
if a new download causes a problem remove it
simple as thatyes i do buy the stuff packs
but i dont buy them here or anywhere else for over 
i wait until circuit city puts the stuff packs on sale for under 
that price is reasonable for the amount of stuff included
if amazon was willing to do that theyd have my business
come to think of it i bet if ea initially dropped the retail price about  these stuff packs would literally fly off the shelves at most storesnot sure what happened to this title the graphics were always good but theres a lot of problems with the particle effects
the ai are pretty dumb compared to the other series
the sound is good but game play could of been better
i dont expect great graphics but these graphics are pretty poor and i use hdmi
ill place this copy on sale and get the pc version instead
i guess the previous reviewer should of tried it first his clairvoyance is pretty bad it didnt even come closewell i only made it works when put both controls at the same times but anyways this products is full of designs mistakesfirst the blue ligths becomes something annoying second it works only with the ps on not even in standby mode three you cant charge only one control when you want itproseasy to attach to controllersusb powerednice design easy to place next to ps hooked up via usbbright blue lights glow at night looks coolconsstopped charging after three daysgot this for my  year old and i played some with him and it is pretty lame
lasted a day or two and he got bored
suggest buy something elsebut i couldnt get into it
now granted its a few years old and graphically weve come a long way but the  processor is the same as then and graphically it just doesnt hold upsound is good  i like westerns ergo i like western games and all the nuances such as music that go with ithowever it cant save the gameplay which is horrible
other reviewers have called it linear and thats an understatement
i mean you either accomplish the task the game wants you to do or you spend a  hour trying to determine exactly the right combination of movements and skewedlogic to move forward
i just didnt get it and with the wealth of great games available to you you should skip this one even as a rental
no amount of clearancerackdiscount is enough to justify purchasing this onewhich is a shame because the genre red dead revolver which completely rocked in its style and gun which was more or less a pretty good homage to the western mythos deserves a good game
western games like western movies dont come out often and when they do you expect a level of quality that just isnt there in call of juarezraiden 
sorry but this game needs to change its name to something else
raiden is much more than this
for you raiden lovers out there that have enjoyed raiden since the beginning this one is a big let down in my opinioni bought it for  total including shipping and was very anxious to get it and try it out
to my dismay after playing it a mere hour i was bored out of my mind to the point where i dont even want to play it anymore
so what is it lacking
everything that made raidenraiden
what happened to the plasma gun
that was my favorite type of gun ever
it was awesome to look at especially when it curves and twirls itself around the screen zapping ur enemies to oblivion
now youre stuck with  types of main weaponsa laser that can move only left and right one that cant and the default vulcan shot aka spread shotnotes to the ppl that made this if you cant do something right dont do it at all all youve done is disgrace the raiden name
like disney trying to make part s and s for their classic disney movies
if you are a true raiden fan youd understand
we all know its a d plane shooter but raiden was much more
raiden  lacked the suspense and the awesome feel of things blowing up
everything felt dry and lacking
in older versions when the masters came in you knew they were the masters because of how suspenseful it became and how everything was set up
now they just zoom in just like any other fighter and the only thing that makes you realize that they are the masters is because theres more bullets coming out from them and they last longer
fighting the masters isnt fun anymore
i hope the makers realize that game designinggraphics has far improved itself
if they were going to release raiden  on ps at least utilize its full potential better
raiden  does not deserve to be on the ps because it doesnt even need a ps to run the kind of graphics that it has
ever heard of trying to be unique
i know the developers wanted to stay with raiden but not only did they fail in that they didnt add anything new to it
sure the d envorinment was nice but the game play is much much more important
give us some more different types of weapons to play with
some more enemies to destroy
what raiden lacks is strategy because most of the enemies you just shoot and no matter what angle you shoot them youll get them
huge potential but unfortunately it died at the hands of a bunch of ppl that dont really know what raiden is really about
at least make the weapons look a lot cooler not just sort of coolerif you bought this game for anymore than i think you got ripped off
i bought it for  and i felt like getting ripped offthe makers concentrated on the wrong aspects of the game
its like transformers
the graphics were sure awesome but the acting was horrific
oh well ppl are sure gullible
if doomsday comes i would say good riddensi love playing tetris but this version of the game has too many issues for it to be much fun
my main complaint was the inability to remap the control figuration
i wanted to use my arcade controller with this game but being unable to reconfigure the button positioning i had to play with awkward button positioning
i also wanted to not have up be for fast drop as it threw off my playsyle
playing with the xbox  controller was a bit better but once again the dpad makes it a painthe multiplayer as of  seems to be totally dead so if that was one of your selling points you are out
if im correct the game is also available on the arcade gamestore so no need to need a disc at all at this point unless you can find it cheapin terms of what the game has to offer it has all of the standard modes that most tetris games have nowadays tspins marathon etc
nothing stands out
as other reviews show the backgrounds are nothing special and the music isnt catchy
overall a lackluster portwhen this arrived i was hoping it would be the ultimate controller cause i love the gamecube remote so much its better than the classic wii remote almost as good as the playstation controlers its good for playing platformracing and other genre but not so good on fighting games thats one of the reason i bought this thing cause i played capcom vs snk  for about  years and the gamecube controller was the best i also played with the guilty gear xx accent core for the wii and nothing beats the gamecube remote
now as for this thing the gamecube xboxand ps adapter it works good on pc mine was running on windows  installed quick
playing roms is great better than an xbox  controller the driver disk that came with it is useless playing it on the ps is good for some games when playing fighting games on this it doesnt configure right also the respond time on it is slow lost alot on street fighter third strike online its good for any other genre eccept fightingfirst let me say that this is a fun game
its easily the best mortal kombat yet
the combat system is simplified from deadly alliance and deception so that you only have to remember two move sets per character including weapon kombat instead of three
some might see two styles as more limiting but for me it helped make each fighter more accessible and made it easier to get into the game
having the full cast of characters from every previous mortal kombat game is also nice and being able to create your own fighter is possibly the best feature of the whole gamehowever the wii version of this game has a lot of strikes against it
having come out so much later than the other platform versions i was hoping nintendo would have added a few things to make it worth the wait
unfortunately the wii version has much less
sure it has the female version of khameleon but that is about all the wii version has over the other versionsthe wii controls arent as easy to learn as theyre made out to be
judging from the message boards ive been to im not the only one with a problem
you have to hold the b button while making the special move motions and you have to time precisely when you press it and when you let go
some times the motion sensor will mistake a sideside motion with a half circle motion and give you the wrong move
sometimes it wont do anything at all
and you cant always tell what you did right or what you did wrong
in a fighting game where every split second counts controls simply have to be more responsive than that
ive gone back to simply using the gamecube controller
thank goodness they made that an optionthe xbox and playstation versions also had a port of ultimate mortal kombat  included with their games
not so with the wii version
this may not be a big deal for some
after all youre paying for mk armageddon not umk   all the same when a game comes out for nintendo so much later than the other platforms id expect there to be more options to choose from not lessbut possibly the biggest shortcoming is no online play
that is simply inexcusable
with the wii nintendo has the ability to start increasing their online playability in games
theres simply no excuse to cut out online play for a game that has it on all other platformsnintendo better get on the ball by making their third party games comparable to what people are getting on the other platforms
when the other platforms have a whole other game port with ultimate mk and online playing capabilities meanwhile the wii has nothing to show for their version coming out months later the choice is painfully obviousall that said mortal kombat armageddon is a fun game
i see no need for me to go back to deadly alliance or deception any time soon
i also love that i can make my own characters for the game
itll keep me playing for some timeplease save your time and most important money on this horrible game
the reason i was stuck into buying this game is because i confused this game with time splitters i bought this game as soon as i noticed it in gamestopbig mistake the game is horriblely medicore
the online did not work at all
save your money and just wait for hazeyet another boring fps i think that resistance is a little better than this game but im still waiting for something a little more fast paced like unreal tournament  which i plan on getting this week
this game is a better rental than a buy the whole time manipulation is fun for the first level and then timeshift just becomes another typical console fpsi didnt know what to expect with this game but since its cheap i decided to give it a try
having played just about all the top shooters this one falls short of the standards of most i have played
controls are ok visuals are solid but there is no intro to the story at all so you have no idea what is going on
plus the aiming reticulezooming is very limited
the time control feature which is supposedly the single most unique thing about this game is almost a direct ripoff from max paynes bullet time and you are forced to use it in order to survive the waves of same enemies
in short this game is not really worth your time if you are looking for a solid shooterin the end dawn of mana hereby dubbed dom is a dud
i liked secret of mana and i loved legend of mana an incredibly underrated game imho so naturally when i read the reviews of those with only fond memories for the former game i scoffed at the obvious misplaced nostalgiaand now im out lets start with the good
dom has some excellent ideas in theory
rather than the boring level grind that so often produces unbalanced rpgs the game favors a much different approach
while a player can level in each chapter these levels reset at the start of a new chapter requiring the player to continue fighting with skill rather than overpowering the opposition in theory at least
moreover each level has ratings based on the ability and the style in which a player disposes of the taks before him  these ratings climb from e to s in ascending order and high ratings have rewards associated to them
ive always loved reward systems in games  its nice to see a supposed rpg incorporating themthe graphics are nice attempting to mingle the watercolored gorgeousness of lom with a dimensional feel
theyre not quite as asthetically pleasing in the end but they hardly offend and often amazethe story is soso although i could do without the origin nonsense
these games have never felt like prequelsequel even in the case of som and its immediate sequel the final fantasy adventure for the gameboy
still i enjoy it for nostalgias sakenow for the bad
everything that i said in the opening paragraph of good doesnt work at all in practice
while the level reset system sounds nice in theory the games development of it leaves much to be desired
basically you throw stuff at enemies
over and over and over and over again
there is very little skill involved  you pick up a rock throw it and smack around the befuddled enemies
sometimes you roll a rock and smack around befuddled enemies
and sometimeswell you get the picture
the combat gets old quickly
it might as well have been turnbased battle actually turnbased battle would have been better becausecontrol issues abound
i have rarely played such a poorly controlled game
between the horrible camera that resists all logic to the gummy and awkward movement of the character it is nearly impossible to enjoy combat
i thought rogue galaxy was bad
this takes the cake
the lockon mechanism is worse than useless  it is actually detrimental to your success
there is no rhyme or reason to the locking ie
you cant see what enemy you will lock on until it happens and as another reviewer mentioned you will shockingly lock onto a completely innocuous foe most of the time in lieu of the immediate danger right in front of you
i would love to know the algorithm programmed for this im pretty sure that if they simply did the opposite it would be betterthe control problems manifest themselves even more in the platform elements discussed by other reviewers
a simple jump over a river becomes a test in patience heck merely crossing a bridge can be an arduous affair
it can be daunting to say the least to finish this game which i havent  i can only take it in small dosesthats about it for the bad  ie
the gameplay is horrible
this game isnt even moderately fun with the lone exception of attempting to beat this horrible system to get some of the rewards for style
there is a lot of collecting to do but it really isnt fun
mark this one in dud categoryaddendum wow is this a bad game
im sad that i gave it two stars in the fun categorystorydawn of mana henceforth referred to as dom by me is an actionrpg platformer hybrid set in the isle of illusia
a boy named keldric and his friend ritzia live peaceful lives in harmony with natureat least until the tiresomely predictable antagonist shows up and manages to ruin everything in less time than it takes you to say plot device
keldy and his fairy friend faye must rescue ritzia and save the world from evil
seriously
thats about as far in depth as i can describe it because thats mostly all there is to it
save the girl defeat the darkness and restore the universe
its not the worst story ive ever seen and the presentation is excellent but i really wish rpgs would stop with these sorts of narratives
you wouldve thought that they could have come up with something a little more original than brash teenage boy on a quest to stop evil and save the gentle hearted damsel in distress but no
obviously notbattle systemsquare apparently realized that the kingdom hearts style of combat was an excellent choice for rpgadventureplatforming games and it shows in dom
keldy can jump around and swing his sword in a simple combo attack much like soras keyblade
what sets dom apart from kh however is the fact that keldy can whip out a handy vine to grab objects and fling them around thus damaging enemies and panicking them
in theory it sounds like a good system to work with but there are highly noticeable flaws with it
number one is the abysmal lockon system
while it honestly doesnt sound like a very difficult thing to get right in a game square has somehow managed to botch the job completely
it frequently locks on to targets in the background and ignores the foreground even when the opposing force is right in front of you
you can cycle through targets but there are often so many objects on the screen at one time rocks crates etc
that by the time youve found the enemy you wanted itll have already hacked off your limbsnumber two is the physics
dom implements the havok engine which also happens to have been used in halflife  however the physics engine seemed more bothersome than innovative for me especially during combat
if you get hit by an enemy keldy will be sent flying backwards as though hes in outer space
the only thing you can do when this happens is watch him go up in an arc and then land face down refusing to move while the adversary gnaws on his gonads
frequently you will have to panic enemies by throwing things at them but this gimmick quickly becomes repetitive in of itself
what could have been an interesting combat system was broken down to the bare basics of picking up throwing and then bashing the enemy with the same combo youll use throughout the entire game
fun
maybe for a little while
long term
absolutely notgameplayi feel as if any more comparison to kingdom hearts will be redundant but something has to be said for the similarities between the two
considering that kh is an extremely lucrative franchise it doesnt surprise me that square wants to replicate as much of the successful formula as much as it possibly can
despite their valiant efforts however a lot of what made kingdom hearts entertaining hasnt been reproduced very well here
dom uses a chapterbased system to advance the plot meaning the game sets you loose in an expansive environment to explore the levels and eventually defeat a boss thus ending the section and moving on with the story
keldy can gain experience by panicking enemies with thrown objects and then once the enemy is defeated picking up medals that will gradually increase his stats
the only way to get these items is to panic the enemies
youre forced to continue picking up rolling throwing or breaking objects simply so that you can advance in the game
using a sophisticated physics engine is one thing but blatantly pushing it at the consumer is another
the vine ability would have been better utilized as an extra  something useful for acquiring greater amounts of medals or simply stunning the enemy
the fact that it feels like such a necessity didnt sit well with me at alleven worse than that however is the fact that keldys level resets to  every time you begin a new chapter
this means that youll go through the process of gaining and then losing stats eight agonizing times during the course of the game
what do people want to get out of rpgs
well a feeling of accomplishment of course
by nullifying the stat bonuses at the conclusion of each chapter dom effectively kills any feeling of productivity and progress
i felt like i was starting at the beginning of the game each time by health was reduced and my attacks became drastically weaker once moreall that said and done the environments are all unique in their own ways and each has a distinct feel to it
however a lot of the time i felt simply lost and without a clue where to go
theres a small radar in the top right hand corner of the screen but its about as useful as an umbrella during a hurricane
it provides your destination but it fails to account for whatever obstacles may be in your way while trying to get there
frequently i felt as though i was being forced to blaze my own trail something i dont particularly enjoy in a video game such as this it was fine in shadow of the colossus
dom is tightlipped with hints and mission objectives which is a problem considering how large some of the levels are
my overall feelings were those of confusion and frustration
its far too easy to get lost and when you do there isnt really a way to find out where you are or how to get where youre going tobut im not quite done yet
since dom is a platformer i wouldve expected that the controls be at least decent
unfortunately much like every other aspect of the gameplay they failed to impress and frequently irritated
keldys movements often seem to lack fluidity he runs as though hes on the moon and his jumping somehow manages to be even worse
couple this with the games ragdoll physics and you can bet that youll be falling off most of the platforms youre supposed to be jumping on
the camera is just as obtuse as everything else
its difficult to control and tough to position behind keldy making for an allaround mediocre experiencevisuals characters and audioif theres any praise i can squeeze out for dom its most likely for the appearance of the game itself
although the core gameplay mechanics are a mess the graphics themselves are beautiful and detailed
the animation during cutscenes is usually quite good its full of eyecandy
im a sucker for video games with sharplooking design but we all know that it cant carry the entire thing
there arent really all that many characters and the ones you do meet are never very well characterized
keldy doesnt differ in the slightest from the many other teenage rpg heroes or if he does the distinction was too subtle for me to notice
to be fair the voiceacting for keldy and co is above average and generally believable if not a bit hokey at times
one other area in which dom excels was the sound
the musical score is fantastic and there were several tracks that i actually enjoyed listening to
in these respects only dom is one of the better rpgs ive seen in the last year or sooveralli genuinely wanted to enjoy dawn of mana but there were noticeable blemishes on the gameplay that marred the experience for me
its a bit of a lovehate relationship i couldnt help but be drawn in by the art and music but was ultimately deterred by the horrendously broken controls and unsatisfying levelreset system
it didnt help that the story was only average and the characters were the same archetypes you see in every rpg these days
im glad i rented it first and anyone else thinking of buying should probably do the same if they dont want to be disappointedthe mana series goes back a ways which helped dawn of mana achieve a certain amount of hype prior to its release
sadly though dawn of mana is a very disappointing platformerrpg hybrid that doesnt do much of anything right in any department
the story of dawn of mana is pretty interesting and longtime fans will get enjoyment out of it to be pure but thats about it
the game is more an actionplatformer than an rpg as you fling monsters around and into each other
while this is entertaining for a while it becomes boring quickly and the sloppy and sluggish controls dont help matters much when it comes to targeting
the sloppy controls also supremely hurt the platforming elements peppered throughout dawn of mana and the games schizoid camera doesnt help matters much either in this department
the only real pluses of dawn of mana are the games nicely rendered graphics and a decent list of spells to work with but other than that this game is a dud
all in all dawn of mana is a very disappointing game that could have been so much better than what we get here
if you want to check out a good actionrpg game check out odin sphere insteadits hard to write a review for a mana game and not talk about secret of mana
a game hailed as not only one of the greatest snes rpgs out there but also as one of the greatest rpgs of all time
over the years however the mana series has gotten progressively worse while other franchises from squareenix continue to be strong
dawn of mana is no exception as it is without a doubt one of the worst mana games ever
it seems there will never be another mana game to hold a candle up to the legacy set by secret
its really sad because dawn of mana like the other mana games to drop the ball had a lot of potential to be good
the developers just didnt do things rightdawn of mana centers on a guy named keldric who is out to save someone named ritzia from an evil king who has kidnapped ritzia so that he can call forth the power of the mana tree and plunge the world into darkness
its a pretty basic story
the good news is that the story is presented really well
the voice acting is top notch and the cutscenes are absolutely gorgeous to look at
unfortunately thats about where the compliments to the game end
the gameplay for as simple as it is is rather frustratingfirstly the game is fairly actionadventure oriented and has a dungeon crawl like feel to it
keldric has whats called a vine sword that he can use to take on his enemies
he can use it to swing enemies into other enemies as well but the real treat with this weapon is using his panic attack which causes enemies to drop items
this is really the only way to get items from enemies
they dont just drop them normally
keldric is also not alone
hes got an ally named faye there to help him out and shes there to cast some supportive magic on him
unfortunately unlike other mana games dawn of mana has no multiplayer
its all really simple stuff until you throw in the games other mechanicsthe targeting system in and of itself is incredibly flawed
when battling enemies you can lock on to them
however for some odd reason the game always locks on to an enemy in the distance never the obvious threat thats taking you on
you can also lock on to other objects but again its never the one you want or one thats close by
and if there are multiple enemies or objects the game has to cycle through them and again it becomes tedious to wait for the game to get to the enemy or object you want
youre better off going at it on your own and not wasting any time with the flawed targeting systemanother major flaw to the design of the game is the level up system
at the start it seems all fine and dandy to level up and get your abilities but the moment you complete a chapter you lose it all
that means after youve gone through chapter  leveled up keldric and faye to take on enemies gotten them some pretty useful abilities and the like youll lose it all once you begin chapter  and have to get them all over again
all your work will pretty much go to waste
the game tries to compensate by giving you emblems which have abilities on themgetting emblems is a task in and of itself
as you go through the chapters the game will rank you
an s ranking is the highest you can get
if you get a good ranking youll be rewarded with an emblem
theres an emblem rewarded for each difficulty level as well
completing chapter  on normal and getting the best rank will yield you a different emblem than if you were to complete chapter  on hard mode with the best rank
your rank is determined by things like how fast yo complete the chapter how many enemies you killed etc
yet even the emblem system has its own flaws
you can only select to equip them before the chapter starts
you cannot change up emblems in the middle of a chapter
instead youll have to complete it
a little more freedom wouldve been nice
also getting emblems is just all out difficult
its almost not even worth it to tryas you go through the game theres also a radar in the upper corner to help you out
it doesnt really provide that much help though
theres a yellow box which represents your goal and then there are blue and red boxes for your enemies
blue just simply means that the enemy has an item
although for some reason youll run into enemies on the map that are marked red on your radar that will drop items while some of the blue monsters give you nothing
chances are yo wont really need the radar but one has to wonder how squareenix managed to screw up something as simple as a radar system
especially since theyve done these sorts of things in plenty of other games flawlessly
the radar isnt scaled properly anyway
there are moments when itll appear an enemy should be right next to you and you discover theyre actually a little ways away
again its not too big but its such a simple concept that the fact that it wasnt done right is rather questionablethe last major flaw in the gameplay department the camera
its a pain to mess around with
especially when in battle and it swivels on you while youre taking on an enemy
its controlled via the right analog stick which makes things a little easier but its the fact that youll spend a lot of time fighting with it to readjust because it positioned itself behind an object so you cant see yourself or because the angle just isnt good
youll spend quite some time fighting with the camera and its just annoying
the fact that theres no button to fix the camera right behind you is also sadto the games credit though it looks and sounds really good
if anything we can say that
squareenix is known for making some gorgeous games and despite dawn of manas flawed gameplay its true here
the look and feel of the game is absolutely fantastic
the voice acting is also pretty good
but the best part of dawn of mana is its soundtrack
the music in the game is nothing short of brilliant
on a technical level dawn of mana is fantastic
but pretty graphics dont make a game fun and thats also true of dawn of manadawn of mana isnt a horrible game its just a very flawed one
the part of the game that matters mostgameplaysuffers from things that a game in this day and age shouldnt suffer from
its especially disappointing considering whats flawed in this game are aspects that squareenix knows how to do well and have demonstrated they know how to do them well time and time again
itll be hard for mana fans to look past the flaws in this one
another mana game takes a diveprosgood graphicsgood soundtrackwell done voice actingconshorrible targeting systembad camerayou start each new chapter at level  losing all the work you did in the last chaptergetting emblems is a pain and you cant change them in the middle of a chapter they can only be equipped at the beginning of onethe radar is virtually uselessi should have known that anything with atarilooks like atari
graphics looked like a typical arcade gamejust terrible
and the story lineterrible
you get what you pay for
i guess when you play the best like call of duty seriesyou get spoiled
buti am sorry it was just terrrible
graphicsloop type music badsadly enough i didnt like the demo and originally decided not to get the game
the in vehicle graphics leave a lot to be desired
i have maxed out the graphics and all other settings and it is easier to tolerate
based upon all the hype i heard against my previous judgment i purchased it at a highly discounted price thank god
i listened to all the fluff from friends who told e if i loved operation flash point which i did that the full version of the game is much better
the movement of the troops is quite bothersome and does not resemble actual movement unless you are talking about a bowel movement at least when they are walking crouched
the pasted facial expressions are so in line with the predecessor
i had a lot of high hopes for this game since i loved the previous releases but i cant really see much improvement over the previous except controls are more user friendly when it comes to joystick support
it strikes me as a prettier remake of the first with a different story line
even though i loved the first and i like the promise of new equipment the flashback factor made me decide not to play it any further
for someone new to the genre this may keep them satiated but to a seasoned fps player there are better titles out
the battlefield series has more realistic movement as does call of duty   i chose to go back to that realm in lieu of continuing to try to like this titleit just takes too long to play a game with big maps you have to be online all day to get good at itnot like battlefield   learning curve is killing meyou cant train in a jet in training mode when you get online you have to capture areas for you to get good weapons thats what i hate about the game if spending all day on a game is enjoyable buy itthis game was rather hard to navigate through which made us lose interest quickly and now it is collecting dustwhen i played the first manhunt way back when i thoroughly enjoyed it
that game much like its successor received lots of negative exposure because of its subject matter content and overall violence
i like most others who waited patiently for the sequel plowed through yet more negative publicity watched rockstar cancel its original release date for the game and waded through all sorts of internet gossip about what had been done to the content of the gamemanhunt the original is a far better game than manhunt and not becaue its gore factor was untouched
it was a better game guys because it had soul
the characters were way more interesting the writing was better and more creative and the last stages were absolutely some of the creepiest ive ever encountered
my personal favorites were the smileys a tongueincheek answer to insane clown posse
i got killed so many times because i was laughing my butt off at some of the lines eg
passing out before the main coursereally well i look divine
why thank you so much it was just something i threw together and my god theyre dropping like flies
in manhunt  you get no interesting characters
instead you get caricatures
it seems two people are involved in some sort of mindaltering experiment the inmates riot people escape others are killed and you try to retrace your footsteps to see what it all means
along the way you are urinated on have feces thrown on you you puke a lot and you kill a lot
and thats about it
the big difference in manhunt  is that even though the killings are much more grotesque than in the first game you cant see any of them because of what rockstar had to do in order to get the game released
a filter has been installed and all you really get in the ability to hear what is happening to your victims
the controls are used differently which i also didnt care fori do not blame rockstar for what it did it simply did what it had to do in order to sell its product
i would suggest however that if there is a manhunt  you see if you cant create characters that are more memorable a storyline that is more than just killing and have a main character your playing audience can feel something forrockstar caved into the political and financial pressure and pass the  dollar loss onto the consumers
after a long await i was thrilled as the next guy to rush out and buy manhunt  as soon as it came out
i read all the reviews and heard the right wing fools complain about the game and thought ok just as the reviews said only the most gruesome scenes will be edited
boy was i wrong
every single kill with the hasty violent or gruesome option you choose is shaded
you cant see anything
what good is this
what other reason would you buy a game like this
yes there are better graphics then in the original manhunt yes there are environmental kills yes breathing has to be controlled now in shadows yes you can now climb and crawl yes the game could have been incredible but it isnt
cant see the environmental kills because they are all shaded too
what good is a ferrari without the engine
what good is manhunt without the gore
all in all since i paid  for the game i am struggling to finish
all in all the fun has been taken out of the game
instead of giving the game and adult rating rockstar wanted to sell to as many people as possible so they could make profit at the expense of the consumers
buyer beware watch the game before you buy it and make your own decisioni loved the original manhunt i have to admit it i loved it
i though it was a sick and delightfully twisted gamenoart
it was spooky gruesome smart intense and totally enjoyable for someone like me
this one like most sequelssucks
it looks like the first it plays like the first its in the same vein as the first but its the details where it falls apart and i mean badin the original the levels were layed out where you were mostly stealth killing or getting into coverbased shootouts and sometimes a blend of the two and the levels and ai were set up for that type of experience
this game has no clue what it wants to be
i tried to do mostly stealth kills but sorry to say you wind up just shooting most of em
speaking of ai though the ai in this one is really bad
in the first one a hunter would inspect a brick hitting a wall or finding his dead buddy but in manhunt  they usually dont care spoiling any opportunity to lure a hunter away from his friends to disfigure and break him
thus you will find it wayyy easier and much less frustrating to just snipe a guy from the shadows turning a once great stealth platform intoa really lame shooteranother real problem is the story
in place of a meager bare bones type of plot kill for sick directors pleasure and survival then revenge with a simple plot that has been made far too rushed and scattered
gone is the simple and enjoyable kill from point a to point b plot now its all twisted with gotta find this guy gotta find this chick gotta figure this outwho am i what happened  this doesnt directly affect the action but somehow it makes for a very rushed and detached experience hardly any of it worth remembering
essentially they made a mountain out of a molehill and it really just annoys more than anything
i had a hard time of following why i was at a place and found it much simpler in the original to just know i was on my way through to fight another type of gang for the directors joy but now its all finding out about a character i care nothing for in a story i care nothing for
coupled with useless flashbacks and twists in the plot i dont care enough to remember any of this gameeven when the director in manhunt bacame impatient you were scolded by the talented brian cox now an annoying nobody screeches at you which really disrupts the type of flow the first had
no velvety voice of a known and great actor now your just getting bitched by some guy that kinda sounds like a cross between a bitchy girlfriend and ray liotta but not nearly as cool as ray liotta and almost as irritating as your exgirlfriendthinking about it i doubt even if the stealth kill werent blurred this still wouldnt be anything nearly as fun as the first
when a you execute a hunter at the point where you strike or shoot or stab or slash a guy a fast and artsy blur jolts everything and the shade of everything goes negative for a bit
about  of the kill is plainly visible but  is blurred
these kills are actually pretty good and i especially like the firearm executions but coupled with the filters and obstructions they had to program in it really doesnt matter
some of the environment kills are entertaining but hardly worth the addition if they were at the cost of everything else i dislikedin short people everything in this game reminded me of manhunt it reminded me of how its notmanhunt and certainly of how its not as good as manhunt
i will now sell this game and fire up the original for the experience that this game failed miserably to acheive and no doubt i will crack a sinister smile and bathe in the joy of hearing brian cox direct me to massacre a bunch of scumbagsi waited years for a sequel to manhunt only to be let down on many levels
the original manhunt is in my top  game for ps ever made
i have replayed it so many times because it is such a challenging fun game with so many exciting characters and levelsbefore we even get into the censorship aspect of manhunt   lets start with the overall look of the game
why didnt the game developers stick with the basic engine of the first one
grand theft auto has always stuck with the basic character controls and design of the game while continuing to improve game play with each release
i expected the same from manhunt  but knew the second i saw the opening screen things werent going to be smooththere is an option in the settings screen that allows you to turn of the screen noise
i would recommend doing this before starting the game
the screen noise does not add anything and takes away from the graphics
unfortunately this does not turn of the distorted filter on the execution screens
the graphics are ok the first game had a slightly cartoonish look to the graphics but they still looked good and in some ways added to the feel of the game more than the new one does
the original seemed darker and creepier too
manhunt  isnt as dark and fails to keep you on the edge of your seat like the original did so well
then we have the camera angles which are just horrible along with the clunky clumsy controls
your main character daniel lamb is too large on the screen and therefore limits what you can see in hallways
sometimes in close hand to hand combat i cant even see what im doing
i just swing away and hope for the best
there are times when you just cant see what is around you or where youre walking due to the very poor camera angles
when trying to do a jump attack from high positions you cant always look down to see where your enemy is due to camera and control problems
when using stealth in the shadows daniel seems to be slightly illuminated rather than dark
makes it hard to tell if youre actually hidden and takes away from the excitement of ducking in the shadows
then you have to control your breathing which i dont think adds much to the game
some of the on screen instructions pop up too quickly and dont give you enough time to read them
i didnt even know what the environmental kills were till about  levels into the game
i decided to start over when i realized i had skipped them allmanhunt  also seems to be void of interesting characters like the first one
in the original manhunt each level brought new and interesting villains to take on
in the new game there seems to be the same boring bad guys on each leveland now we have the censorship part of the problem
executions are now blurred and distorted which take away from the effect of them completely
its not even that exciting anymore
this is disappointing because the executions have become more gruesome and interesting
and along with the new environmental executions you really feel let down by the censor filter they put on them
the original manhunt was just as bloody and violent yet sony had no problem releasing it
so why has manhunt  been stripped down so much
pressure from big mouth conservatives who spend time going after video games rather than tackling any real problems in societythe game grew on me more and more with each level but it has its flaws
i expected more from a sequel to one of the best games ive ever playedbut this game sucksim a diehard transformer fan and a ps fan as well but i would hate to lie and say this game was anywhere close to good because its so close to being the most awful and annoying game on the psever
 the missions are boring simple and not planned very well
this game was definately rushed because it had alot of potential i thought i was the only one having sound problems but after reading other peoples  reviews it seems like im not alone the controls suck
especially when youre driving
talk about understeer and then a sudden oversteer makes the mission absolutely annoying
i dont expect it to be a grand turismo but the programmers making this game were very confused on wether they wanted the driving to feel simulated or arcadelike trying to drive and trying to lock onto the enemy is frustrating as hell transforming is cool but it gets old when everything is so damn frustrating ai is horrible
talk about dumb enemy robotsactivision from my point of view makes decent games
not great games but decent
but this one is a total failure in my bookim glad i rented it and im hoping you do too before buying itspiderman  does its movie counterpart absolutely no justice in this poorly and lazily done game
this does not seem much better than spiderman  for the ps
there is a few new additions in there
such as a slightly improved combat system a fresh coat of paint and a little bit of reflection on some surfaces
the combat system seems terribly incomplete almost no transition between moves no fluidity at all it just felt rushedbosses and some missions felt unnecessarily frustrating unable to see some enemies while they would attack what you were trying to protect
i also had several problems with mission coins disappearing
stupidly powerful enemies that stopped taking damage after you had given them an unrelenting beating for nearly  minutes knocking them over countless timesthe god of waresque button system is really innovative and absurdly complicated
god of war normally limited its buttons to just the face buttons
this one throws face control stick movements and rr l l at incredibly inept time so unless you are really quick some give you less than a second to complete the combination
luckily when you mess up a combination you are never put back at the start of the level or anything it just repeats and unlike god of war it will use the same sequence you just failed however fail one against a boss character he can do up to  damage to you  failures and you are toast or really close to it
control could have had more attention paid to it
the swinging is cool but run into a bulding and the camera will sometimes freak and get stuck somewhere momentarily thats not a terrible detriment to gameplay its when the camera gets stuck somewhere in a fight and you swinging at nothing you can see thats frustratingbruce campbell makes his return as the narrator though he really gives you nothing new for this game aside from the matrixstyle bullet time
if you have played spiderman  dont expect too much new here
like i said a fresh coat of paintthis does not exactly live up to the free roaming sandbox gameplay
framerate tends to struggle in closed areas people are not very well detailed at all they all look like scared puppy dogs while you are very well designed and the highest amount of detail is paid to spidey and the bosseswith that said this game does have its shiny points
physics are somewhat used here the sun reflects off windows realistically at night you can go to buildings and look inside even though they may be a cheapo jpeg sitting behind a window detail was paid to it a little
spidey looks incredible up close you can really see the detail in the suit and black suit spidey is a crazy blast to play
however spoilerwhen you get towards the end and you have to fight venom and sandman venom is not really a problem as long as you keep him stunned
sandman is a pain in the glutes when you take over as new goblin the sixaxis control is frustrating
laying down while playing this part is almost impossible
and judging the bombs is all hands down frustrating for a casual gamer such as myselffinal thoughtif time and attention were paid to this game it could truly have been incredible
i would have waited another  months to a year for a truly great spiderman game rather than  mediocre ones
this game is fun and if you are a spideyfreak definitley dont pass this one up
if you understand the history of filmgame franchises give this one a rent
other than that pass this one by
or pick up rainbow six or even the darknessthis is a typical animated moviebased video gameit has shrek fiona donkey and the rest of the shrek gangfun for a little while but not enough to keep playingin not sure if this game follows the plot of the rd installment of shrek but wow is it violent
it starts off with shrek and the cat puss in boots
beating up various baddies and collecting beer steinscoins
im not real sure where it goes after that because my  year old niece lost interest due to difficulties opening a drawbridge style door
obviously she is not a videogamer
so i took the helm for about ten minutes to see if i could open the elusive gate
i had no luck opening it and we returned banished the game to the video store from wince it came
if you are looking for a game that will appease the youngster in your house i would go with super mario galaxy which is a much more kid friendly game
mario is much easier to control and the violence is more cartoony
also the vibrant colors and cute characters in super mario galaxy will make you and your children giddyits no secret that like the film itself the video game tiein for spiderman  is a disappointment on the consoles
the wii edition of the game is no different and what makes it even more disappointing is the fact that the games attempt to make use of the wiimote is an ultimate failure
the game follows the plot of the film for the most part as you play as spidey in an open world new york and take on generic baddies as well as big time villains like sandman venom the new goblin and the lizard to boot
the game attempts to make sue of the wiimote to swing through the city which youll either enjoy or hate which along with the sloppy combat controls really mar what could have been otherwise solid gameplay
the games look is marred as well by an overly choppy frame rate combined with stiff character models
there are a few good points about spiderman  though but they are few indeed
the game features voice acting from many of the principal actors from the film including tobey maguire james franco thomas haden church topher grace jk simmons and bruce campbell who reprises his role as your video gaming guide and swinging through new york city is still pretty fun
however the repetitive gameplay gets boring and the game has an overly linear feel to it as well
all that being said spiderman  is worth checking out if you own a wii and are a spidey fan but dont expect anything great from it at allafter shown what was possible with spiderman  this game is a big let down
the fighting is really boring and the graphics are bland
the webslinging is kind of fun once you get the hang of it but thats the only good thing i have to say about this game
if you must play it rent it absolutely dont buythe only real positive about this game is the graphics
the transformers look very nice in all their detail
the transformation is great to look at too
going from vehicle to robot and back again is a repeatable enjoyment as long as youre not involved in a missionthe worst part of this game is the camera worktargeting schemethis is revealed best when youre recovering the all spark as bumblebee
there are endless cockroachlike robots surrounding you and they dont want you to get it
note if you turn into the car youre instantly dead they hit you with enough force to throw you back into walls and out of the action area
you will be turning the camera constantly as youll find yourself looking inside a wall or anywhere other than at the enemythis seems to be a bumblebee issue because when you play as ironhide you just smash through those pesky thingsthe targeting scheme needed an automatic lockon feature
when you need to throw a tree or pole at starscream youll find yourself tossing it just to the side of him
too frustratingi didnt mind the missions as some have said they were too short or repetitive
the driving details are difficult but it just takes a few missions to get used to how the steering works
its not like every racing game where you can turn with ease at  mph
you just have to get used to itthe biggest drag to this game is the camera work
and its enough to pull this review all the way down to two starsbefore i start let me say i really wanted this game to be good i really did
this is likely why i gave it so many chances to redeem itself only to see it fall flat on its faceto be fair it does look good
on the highest quality it approaches oblivion almost but not quite
it does have a storyline and a plot not good ones mind you but still more than oblivion ever managed to offer
it offers lots of open ended play and will keep you entertained for many hourssadly this game is completely undone by the gameplay itself
let me elaborate
you start the game by customizing the level of ugliness you want your human male main character to have
no option for additional races or even for a female character
just several slidebars to adjust things like hair style lip size and whatnot
if this sounds like oblivion it should this game merely uses a badly constructed shameless ripoff of the creation system oblivion usedafter giving up on ever making a character you can stand to look at you may start the game
the game start off with some battle fundamentals thus introducing you to the horribly broken system of combat
essentially you use the same three hit combo over and over
after finishing the combo you will stand there uselessly for a second or two and allow the enemy to pummel you senseless at which point you begin again
you cannot block or even fight while moving the best you can do is hop backwards
this fancy little dodge is more of an insult than anything
many times i attempted to jump back to avoid being hit only to be nailed anyway and stand there uselessly for a second
at times combat is so slow and jerky you feel like you are playing a turned based gameafter seeing combat you are then introduced to the amazing world of voice acting or rather the lack of it
the acting is terrible and completely drags you out of the game
the use of thees and thous gets annoying very fast and brings you to reply forsooth you all sound like morons
shakespeare never wielded a sword casted a fireball or met even a single troll please dont make characters sound like him
the main characters voice is terrible
i have no idea why they casted such a terrible person for the part
after hearing him speak for more than three seconds i would have scratched the voice portion of the game altogetherthe world of the game is rather large so horses are provided for your use
sadly i dont think the game designers have ever been near a horse
they handle terribly react slowly and get stuck on nearly every object you encounter
they even come to a full stop when you try to run downhill
the horrible bugginess of the horses in the game finally caused me to swear the things off and walk from that point onwhile the list of things i hated about the game can go on for hours i think i will bring up one last killing fact then call it good
game balance
i really dislike the fact that i could wade through an entire melee against countless enemies completely unscathed only to catch one arrow in my platearmored back and be killed instantly
or worse to be attacked by enemies that can kill you in one hit
these two events happen about five to ten minutes into the game by the waywrapping up two worlds had the potential to become the next oblivion
the addition of a plot and storyline was exactly what oblivion needed and i had hopes that this game would do it
the complete failure of creating a sensible battle system or even balancing the weapons and monsters makes this game gutwrenching to sit through
add the last blow to the head known as terrible scripts and voice acting and you get one amazing pile of salty garbage which we may now call two worldsthe bad in this game vastly outweighs the good
let me start by saying the story is horrible a sad mix of poorly written corny old english dialog and distractingly bad voice acting
without a solid story to move the game along theres not a lot leftmost of the game you will spend fighting
every monster is pretty much the same as they are either ranged or melee
besides timing the dodge key there isnt much skill associated with fighting and while it might be fun for a while it quickly gets old
further magic seems underpowered for the most part so youll likely be forced into swords or bowsthe sidequests arent much better than the main quest if at all
none of them really leap out at you are all pretty generic
theres no real scripting that gets put into these quests so they are all of the find and kill or find and retrieve varietyas mentioned in other reviews riding a horse is woefully bad
the horse having its own ai is a novel concept sure but poorly implemented and absolutely annoying
i found myself walking more often than not just to spare myself the troublethe morality system is also lacking
sure you have a reputation in various areas but you never really feel that the game even recognizes your evil deeds
your character just seems to act in accordance to where he is and who he is talking to
while you do have choices the ethics system is not very good and leaves you feeling that being good or evil doesnt really matterwith no good story painfully bad voice acting and dialog and poorly written generic sidequests what is good about this gamethe graphics are nice though poorly optimized it seems and a step behind its competitors
make sure you update your video drivers
also the teleport system is handy and spares you from the drudgery of having to walkride everywhereoverall
this game isnt so great and isnt worth  certainly
buy it on the bargin bin if anything otherwise buy oblivion if you havent alreadyi was all hyped by this game after reading about it on the net
i foolishly preordered it thinking it might be a fun hacknslash like diablo or sacredi was wrongfor an rpg you have one choice and one choice only in the singleplayer game
male
human
thats itthere are no classes
no races
you can allocate points to different skills but your combat will come down to this for every fight im not kidding
right click fireball rclick rclick rclick
out of mana
swordstaff l click l click l clickyou cant target mobs
you cant change targets
the game targets for you
you cant click a body to loot it
you have to walk up to it an eye appears and you hit the spacebar to interact with it
there is no mouse pointer on the screen at all
i hate not having control over what i want to do in a game
let me choose my target pleasethe mobs and boy the variety youll see wolves bears and boars all come in packs of  or more
you wont find a single mob in this game it seems
the graphics are subpar
i read somewhere this graphics engine was being developed in  believe me it showsthe soundi could go on and on about the sound
suffice it to say if you have a creative card good luck getting it to work
i finally manged to dont ask me how
the faq suggests get this removing your creative driver and going back and using the ol ms generic drivers as a fix
i guess they really are thinking in  ehthe quests arent fun the voiceovers are horrid and fighting from mounts
good luck controlling your mount or steering it
youll dismount for all of your combat youll get so fed up with itim not trusting any new southpeak for any games again
no more eastern european game designers for me
im done with them
theyve always dissapointed me beyond divinity anyone
trust mepass this one byafter playing other spiderman games i figured this one would be about the same with new missions
it isnt  in fact it is astoundingly badthere are some major issuesfirst the bad plot that has almost nothing to do with the movie
do you remember brock getting fired because he dressed up like black spiderman and mugged people
how about mj breaking up with peter because he got nasty and knocked over a wine glass
what about sandmans kid locked in the trunk of the taxi that mj was dangling from at the end
i would like to know if activision was simply not told the majority of the plot or if they just decided to kind of made it up as they went alongsecond the short length
after long side missions i beat the game in  hours
i bet you could finish the game in less than  without the side missions
they also cut several storylines from the ps version like kingpin rhino and scorpionthird it looks like they replaced the actors with zombies
mary jane looks the worst
seriously though this game is a textbook example of the uncanny valleyfourth the controls suck
there is a slight delay in your attacks so combat is hard to get used to
also they removed many of the fun moves fromspiderman there are also tons of glitches
i loved it when in a mission a guy decided to stand on my shoulders or get carried in the air slightly to the left of me
also you can frequently fail a mission because all of these glitchesfinally the amount of loading is ridiculous
for example if you have just completed a mission this is what will happen
first loading then text says mission passed
followed by more loading
you get a few xp then loadingagain
five second cut scene
you guessed it  more loadingthere is some good in the game
bruce cambell as usual is a top notch narrator
also the gang wars are an improvement on  and actually makes it seem like what you do positively affects the cityin the end this is a depressingly bad gamespiderman was infinitely better
even the averageultimate spidermanwas better than this
buy virtually any other spiderman product and youll be better offi bought this game when it first came out and found it the other day
now i know why i hardly played it
jumpy camera ridiculous missions and silly enemies
sorry just swinging around ny could not save this one
i remember having much more fun with spiderman i really tried to have fun with this but when some gang kept respawning out out pots in one of the hangouts i knew this was bad
not to mention the arsenic candy gang
really
i found myself actually being emabarrassed for spiderman having to fight a gang of school girls
i was more embarrassed when they mopped the floor with me because of the horrible combat system
combat in this game is totally nonsatisfyingwith so many other spiderman games to choose from you should definitely pass on this
pick up web of shadows insteadwhere to start
the camera is awful its jerky and all over the place
the textures are blocky on the characters except spidey he looks great
the combat is button mashing frustration or just plain boring this game is a rushed  jumbled huge mess
completely disappointingthe aminmations are missing frames the characters look like retarded people on drugs
sure the web swinging is well done but they had that down  in the last game
the only reason it even gets two stars is some of the context added stuffala god of war where press certain buttons to complete a section of battle or a train rideit looks a little better than  but thats because its on next gen systems
activision pushs out another me to license game thats not fun and very frustrating in parts
the building textures are blurry this game was rushed to meet the movie deadline if they fixed the cam made the combat fun and  upped the textures on all the other characters and buildings this game could have been ok it stinks as is and i am returning my copy
dont botheri rented this game for my  year old son
thank goodness we didnt waste 
we were only able to get through one or two missonslevels
the map on the right hand side of the screen that you use to find out where you are and the bad guysrobots are is too difficult for my son to understand
the car that you drive is too darn hard to drive
its  impossible to drive straight steer and stop because of the sensitivity of the controls
you also have time limits that you have to meet or the mission fails
dont buy the game but do see the movie
the movies great but the game is terriblethe graphics are pretty awesome but theres not much game here
its essentially a buttonsmasher with nexttono strategy and driving moments that handles pretty poorlythat you can choose between factions but not robots is equally sad and wanderlust isnt what gamers mean when they say they like free roaming gamesnotsonice tryever watch a bad movie yet have a great time doing it
welcome to two worlds a game which is really really really bad but bad in an enjoyable sort of way if you have a sense of humor and dont take it too seriouslyfor starters comparing this game to oblivion is a joke
the framerate in two worlds is stuttery the menu system is clunky the collision detection especially in combat is inconsistent the controls for horseriding is unresponsive usually delayed by at least a second or two and the difficulty is ridiculously inconsistent
within only a few hours of play i could easily slay a whole village of groms goblins but after i walked up the wrong mountain i found a fist full of cyclops in my face and baminstant deathanyone who seriously considers this game to be even a contender to oblivion i suggest should have hisher head examinedhowever despite its many many many flaws the game can be quite enjoyable
even though the difficulty is unpredictable the game is very forgiving since it allows you to respawn at the nearest healing statue without any penalty
and after you find a twohanded weapon the collision detection is much less an issue than it is with a onehanded weaponbut definitely the most amusing and satisfying aspect of this game is the horrible dialogue and godawful voice acting that will never get old to me
the voice acting is an attempt at mimicing olde english but it is a miserable and hilarious failure since it sounds like nothing more than american english with words like perchance mayhap methinks tis and so on injected into the dialogueit sounds annoying and im sure it is for most people but i cant help but belly laugh at the overacting and absurd dialogue
take this quote for example youve had a touch of the sunstroke methinks
perhaps you should drink some water and lie down for a while
another charm which could also be called an annoyance depending on your sense of humor is your characters tendency to talk to himself in the most stupid ways imaginable
after attempting to pick a lock and failing my character showed his genius by saying out loud hmmm its locked
gee ya think
another good one is when it starts to rain several seconds later your character will wittingly say its starting to rain
brillianceif you didnt think any of that was funny then dont bother with this title
if youve never played oblivion now is a good time
if you have and want another title of the same caliber dont even try this game out
just play oblivion againif you wish to try it anyway i definitely suggest going in with a sense of humor and you may come out with some amusement
or maybe i should say it like this when playing two worlds perchance you will have some amusement methinks if mayhap you have a sense of humoryou may note that i rated the game as fun but overall poor
the gameplay can become a bit addictive after a point
once the hero becomes powerful and just doesnt stop you can maul your way through enemies that once gave you problems
theres also a massive loot system and you can combine simlar items to make higherclass ones
this makes for an incredible depth of customization and a fun factor in picking your equipment especially once you became the aforementioned deathdealing machinebut up until you hit that mark the game is just horrible
heck even after you hit it the game itself is still horrible
the story has some potential but ultimately sounds like something that a twoyearold came up with
the hero loses his sister searches for her finds out shes been kidnapped and then goes on a journey of selfdiscovery as he uncovers the truth behind a legend surrounding his family and the powers he and his sister share
the dialog used to deliver the story is absolutely bottombarrel trash and the voice acting throughout the game will make you cringe
i got to the point where i just read the dialog as quickly as i can so can skip the poor voice actingthe map is asinine
first its huge which is nice
but whoever made it basically took a giant square and ran a randomizer over it plugging in a few numbers for max height
read the game has too many hills
theyre everywhere
theres no such thing as a flat plain anywhere
its just up and down and up and down
its like the developers never actually went outside to see if what they made makes any sense against the real world
i mean it detailed and can be pretty at times but the hills are just a pain
this wouldnt be a problem if not for two things it makes exploration very hard
if you take a wrong turn over a hill you can end up sliding some stupid distance and not be able to climb back up
because that one hill will be surrounded by dozens of others most of which will prevent you from just hopping back up to where you left off it can literally take  minutes to return to the top of it just to go the other way
this is incredibly obnoxious as you must explore the entire world to get the location achievements your horse is an idiot
once you get one youll find that the horse randomly cant pass certain types of terrain
this is especially true of  of the roads which are bizarrely designed like very deep and broad ruts that are cut into the landscape instead of just being on top of the surface
the sides of most of these roads are so steep that the horse cant walk across them
youll turn to leave the road to go explore some feature and the horse will get to the edge and then just stop or more annoying turn completely around and go the other way
you have to stop the horse get up off of it walk across over to where you wanted the ahole to go and then call it to you
youll find that it can in fact make it across that spot just not with you on itspeaking of the horse its annoying for another set of reasons its supposed to make fighting foot soldiers easier but it doesnt
the horse isnt very maneuverable and the controls are just poorly done
so trying to fight enemies on foot is a pain of trying to get the horse to face the right direction and trying to get your character to swing his weapon on the right friggin side of the horse
you also cant wield a twohanded weapon other than a bow from horse back but you can use doublewielding from horseback
its just weird you can pick up herbs and random objects lying on the ground and way out of reach from horseback but you cant loot the enemy you just killed or open treasure chests from horseback
so you have to keep jumping on and off the thing every time you get in a fight the controls arent just unintuitive theyre antiintuitive
you have to press the up button to move forward
normal right
not so when you realize that holding the button causes the horse to accelerate and rapidly
and letting it go doenst stop the horse
push up and let go of the controller and the horse will keep moving forward
neat
kind of
but now you need to stop because some wolves are attacking you
you have to push down to stop
but you can only do that when the horses movement is aligned with the screen
that is if youve turned the camera to look to the side you have to turn it back to face forward then hit down to stop the horse
otherwise hitting down does something random whether turning the horse to face toward the camera or turning it away or turning it some other random directionits better to find a horse that can carry a lot of weight and just use it as a travelling treasure chest
just park it near a transporter or in a nearby city and come back to it as you explore and find treasure you want to keep
the horse can save you a lot of travel time going between towns and cities but only in areas where youve already killed all the enemies
and the transporter system works better anyway and you dont want to try to be on the horse inside the towns and cities because its so unmaneuverable
i actually got my horse caught on a merchant to where the merchants character was litteraly inside my horse and neither of us could move and i couldnt dismount because that button is the same as the talktothemerchant button poor controls
fortunately i was able to twist around and get free but it took a while and was painthe controls are bad in every way
in combat theres no blocking or dodging just a jump back
swinging your weapon can take a while
not that the swing is slow but that it can literally take up to a full second for the character to respond to the button press and swing his weapon
you can only swing a limited number of times but that number appears to be random and situationally based and i have no idea what it is
i just know that after xnumber of swings i should just go ahead and hit the jumpback button before i get creamed
the jump button is also not the prototypical a
its y
x doesnt attack but draws your weapon
the attack button is a trigger but if you press it while under attack and your weapon isnt drawn you dont attack
its like the character is telling you im getting hit and youre pressing the attack button but my weapons not drawn so ima just sit here and bleed everywhere
what the hellthe power wheel is a nice concept but poorly executed
each weapon has different skills associated with it but the skills are grouped together so that if you assign a type for one slot you assign several different weaponspecific abilities to that slot
all you have to do is change weapons and the slot automatically changes to that weapons skill from the same group
its a nice touch but when you select the power from the dpad it doesnt pause gameplay to bring up the actual wheel
it just changes an icon in the top left of the screen and because of the inaccuracies of the dpad you often get the wrong power
and once youve selected the right power you have to then press the other shoulder trigger
this makes combat a malay of pushing the attack trigger desperately trying to select a power from the dpad and pushing the power trigger
i just leave mine on my heal spell and dont bother with the others because most of them have low percentage success rates anyway
all you really need in the game is just a lot of strength and an axe weapon with high slashing and bludgeon damage and you can run over just about everything
the powers are mostly superfluous and not very usefulalso the treasure system is vast
this is at first a boon because you get to sweep through and get more and more powerful items
however in order to combine items to make a higherclass one you have to have two of the exact same type
each piece of armor has a set number and there are least  sets in the game
a set includes helmet chest gauntlets leggings and boots
thats  items in armor alone
then theres dozens of different types of shields and at least  different types of weapons and at least  different types of ring
there arent that many chests or enemies in the game which means youre not going to find a lot of the same item in the wild
some items are very powerful but also super rare so in order to get those to a decently effective and high enough class you have to find them and purchase them
this can be difficult as earning gold is limited since enemies do not respawn chests do not refill and you can only steal from each npc one time
my suggestion is to save up until the very end and just power up your favorite endgame endbringer by visiting shopsthe camera is also very annoying
its constantly recentering but the default angle the camera centers on is mindbogglgingly bizarre
when youre on your horse the camera recenters to what seems to be a large angle toward the sky
but since most of the game is bizarrely hilly as ive said before and youll be facing downslope most of the time this means that most of what you care about is going to be at the very bottom of the screen
if you try to angle the camera down it will instantly retilt back up
when youre not on your horse the angle is different whether youre running across a semiflat area usually across the side of a hill rather than down it the angle is slightly upward
but if youre running downhill the angle changes to look at a spot about a meter in front of your character making objects just a few meters away disappear off the top of the screen
so you have to angle the camera upward to see where youre going
you also cant just hold the camera an angle since moving the stick even slightly will always move the camera as far to one side as it will go
so you have to constantly fight the cameras recentering by tweaking the right stick in the direction you want to move the camera
the entire game
nonstop
it
is
really
annoyingthen theres the frame rate
the camera doenst move smoothly in any sense of the word
when turning the screen jumps by at least an entire degree at a time
running forward is jumpy too object dont glide by the way they do in most smoothmotion games
they jump toward and eventually past you
the motion is eyejarring horrible
youll want to play this game on a small a screen as you can so you dont ruin your eyes with the motionsicknessinducing frame rate
part of the problem with the rate is from the fact that the game seems to load up the entire world into memory rather than just a small piece
if you can get high enough on one side of the map you can see clear to the other side of it including cities towers and fortresses
most features like smaller towns and npcs will pop into sight as you get close enough
but the actual lay of the land is visible at any distance and you can see the trees being rendered from far away
if the developer had actually put a horizon that the game would be a lot smootherfinally theres the character themselves
i dont think they hired an artist to create the wireframes
theyre just atrocious
everything
the main characters main npcs orcs groms and wolves are all ugly
wolves dont have any of the sleekness or elegance associated with real wolves either they all look like pugfaced pitbulls and run around like spastic poodles
bears are hideous
the only things that look halfway decent are the skeletons and thats only because theres no a lot to them to screw up visuallythis game is bad
its got a lot of good ideas but its just poorly executed
it definitely wont thrill you and can be very frustrating at times
the dialog sucks the story is subpar and the controls are bad
it is however mindless and generally easy to play
if you ignore the story and spend a few hours building up your character it be an somewhat relaxing stressrelief to sit back turn off your brain and just tear through enemy ranks
when the price drops below  it can be worth the buy to have something to do for a week or so
but dont buy this game expecting to be wowed
because as an actual game it does suck and sucks hardi tried this game and was very disapointed i thought it would be a oblivion type game or at least a great story rpg its not much of either
the graphics are great but it freezes every few mins because of all the grass graphics and such
i guess you could get more indepth with the game and have more of a story line i personaly beat the game in  hours max
you can just hack and slash your way through it the designers left alot of bugs in it so you can get past doing alot of stuff by simply killing quest people which takes alot out of the gameabove all its a  for me
it has a online mode but the southpeak game servers are so laggy with online play its like watching your character do the matrix in slow mo the whole time you play
id say its only worth the  bucks if you really want fast gamer pointsthere are so many things wrong with this game but i still played it for hours and hours
the voiceacting and cutscenes are not bad  they are shockingly bad  like wow that is the worse ever kind of bad
the frame rate on horses is unplayable
the guidance on how to play is basically missing
the story is stupidly simple and the combat system is very simple
setting aside those things the game has a lot going for it
the world is huge
it nearly never crashes
the quests are not overly repetitive
there is nearly no dull farming
there are many good looking mobs and places to explore
the teleport system works nicely
the loot tables are huge
leveling goes at a good pace and you can upgrade and customize your character and his gear all over the place
so turn on subtitles dont get a horse and be patient as you first explore
two worlds was a diamond that was ruined but it still has some sparkle if you can look past the flawson the back cover it lists a quote from someone that this game is oblivion on steroids
given that its  ok to compare this to oblivion my favorite game next to anything gtai felt this game was more like morrowind  hard to control far too much unmanageable info from npcs terrible fighting and messy menusi know its  and this game came out in what 
but oblivion did too and i would still play that excellent game today if i hadnt already won it to pieceslet me break this down for youstory i have no idea whats going on
theres so much badly delivered dialogue and overwhelming amount of info that i literally have no idea what is going on
im just going to kill bad guys
how about thatgraphics the game itself isnt bad
close ups when people talk is pretty bad
a lot of times lips dont line up to what is being spoken or dont move at all
but i find it to be really jumpy moving around
its just not smoothvoicework a joke
wow  everyone who trashed this in other reviews here is spot on
its so terrible  just patheticgameplay its ok to explore but again its just not smooth
and dont get me started about the fight sequences  theyre terrible
first  you cant block
second  fighting groups of enemies is just terrible  you cant single out your attacks or block so you just get pummelled
this is why i had to use the cheats  its just a terrible terrible fighting systemmenus my least favorite of all time  well one of my least favorite
its not intuitive how you equip or sort stuff
or use stuff for that matter
and how many potions have i whipped through by accidentally hitting the bumper buttons while playing
ughi could go on but ill spare you
to sum up its not polished  its kind of a hassle to play and explore  the story is muddled  menus are painful to use  the voicework is laughably bad
im glad i bought this for like three bucks or i might be mad
however i do enjoy it despite these numerous shortfalls
if you like rpgs and dont mind having to cheat this game is perfectthis game sucks and i actually played it for a while
i think that sums up the reviews both the bad and good ones
its not a good game people
some have simply chosen to seriously overlook all its flaws to enjoy the few likable things about it
things such as the weapons and as any rpg player loves the leveling up aspect
but everything else about it is very dull and not worthy of todays standards
how can a game like this come out quite a few years after games like oblivion
a true step back
 and that is kinda generous for the most partearly commentators of this game said it was like oblivion on steroids
unfortunately it turned out more like oblivion on dope
i wanted to like this game
for the record i love two worlds ii
the bow combat in that game was great
five star in my book
ive heard other reviewers compare this game to dark souls
its unfair because this game came out in  and dark souls in  i bought a new copy of this game to encourage south peak to make two worlds  this first title in the series shows promise
the spell stacking system is in place
this was also well executed in the sequel
both games suffer because there is no lock on feature to target enemies
i often swung my sword and cast spells just to the left or right of where my enemy stood
seriously this game really looks worse than some ps titles
the framerate wasnt as bad once i started playing
still the graphics ended up being downright awful
the gameplay was just monotonous button mashing
for rpgs such as this inventory management is a game of strategy in itself
knowing what items to buy sell or store away is half the battle
yet the terrible item management in this game managed to ruin most of the fun even in this
i couldnt move similar items next to each other in the inventory
i picked up tons of useless weapons from enemy combatants
i would sell this but soon learned that money doesnt even really matter in this game
i ended up just leaving enemy combatants unlooted because my inventory is full
my advice play two worlds ii with a bow powered character to see how great this game could have been
the storyline in the second is top notch toothis game was poor in many ways but you could have fun with it
what disappointed me most besides a poor interface and spotty game progression was the ending
also i ran around the map at a pretty low level avoiding encounters i was bored
i ran into a person who immediately progressed my story wayyy ahead in a way that made little sense taking into account the fact that i yet to complete a number of quests
i guess i was supposed to have completed more of the game before i went to that part of the map
so much for freedomwith graphics from games we played on the apple e and an inventory that only one of the designers could possibly understand i cant understand why southpeak is still in business
this is a complete waste of time money and just about anything else a gamer might havemy favorite feature is how the heros eyes are almost always crossed in the cut scenes and conversationsthis game graphic is good compared to other wii games
i like the fighting scenes even though theyre short
it might be because im not a hard cored gamer
however the frustrating control makes this game boring after  missions
for example while i was in a car form i could not  reverse
i had to transform into the robot to go backward
while fighting a lot of times i moved the wii remote as instructed by the manual but i got no responseafter playing it for  minutes i gave up
i saved  dollars by renting itthis game was pretty simple and got boring quickly
the level of detail in the game was about equivalent to the games i played as a young kid on the original nintendo and the plots were quite repetetive go find this and kill it go protect this get here etcit was about transformers and it was fun to be able to transform into cool cars and even a helicopter but i got bored with the game very quickly and never finished it
it might be alright for young kids who loved the movie but it would take a young kid to not see through the repetitiveness of the missionseven though this is an adventure game you need a powerful computer to run it
my computer is new so it was ok  i couldnt get immersed in this game because it is all about writing down user names and passwords then reading file after file  then you go from room to room where you cant tell if there is something important to see or do
i got really bored so i finally gave upthis game could have been fantastically suspenseful if not for the horrible controls
im not a fan of fps games where the camera is only from the characters eye for  reasons
first controlling the action is nearly impossible you just dont have the right perspective
second the  ever present fisheye lens
are they trying on purpose to make me sick  give me a whopping headache
why torture the audience
it is possible to create a game where the mouse  keyboard work seamlessly together and the action seems second nature
that doesnt happen in this game i blame this mostly on the forced first person perspective
the controls are set up fairly straightforward and intelligently but it stops there
the game first starts out with very helpful explanations how to perform certain actions as you need them
however complex actions such as turning a wheel were very difficult to perform and little help was offered as to how to do them
i spent a great deal of time just trying to get the character positioned correctly so that i could perform actions
then my action icon would disappear if i didnt do it just right or i accidentally dropped an item
i was forced to move the character around in an attempt to trigger the action icon and many times it would trigger and disappear immediatelynot all of the action possibilities were covered and i was left in the very beginning trying to figure out how to move a bookcase
i tried all sorts of positions and tools only to find out that i was supposed to grab it and walk backwards in effect pulling it onto myselfanother problem is actually seeing the game
i had to play it at night with all the lights off with the brightness and contrast turned up to max on my monitor and even then it was still hard to see
totally unacceptableas for the game itself it is definitely suspenseful and scary
it really had some first class scares in it and unlike some scratchytype games these scares are intersperse throughout the game
i really think this is one of the scarier games ive played with great atmosphere
most of my fear came from the unknown
they successfully utilized sound or the lack thereof to scare the bejeezus out of me
unfortunately the frustrating controls really break the mood and for me ruined the overall gameif you like the fps fisheye lens type games you will definitely like this one
if you are more like me but want and interactive suspenseful game allow me to recommend indigo prophecy which i like to describe as wowi have not played an super mario paper games and this is the first mario game i have played on the wii
i did not buy the game i rented it insteadprosintergration of wii remote functions  the wii controller is held sideways to simulate playing an old school mario game but there are some twists involved
for example when using certain powerups you would have to change the position of the wii remote to match what is onscreen
the rumble function of the remote is used during various times of the game and adds a little but not much fun to the gameplay
you can point the remote at the tv to access important information about characters and objects
also when the remote is pointed at the tv hidden objects can be foundgraphics several people have give the game a low rating because of the graphic but i find the game graphics comparable to a well done cartoon
although the graphics are not like the graphics of a ps or xbox  i still consider them better than that of similar games on a psdifficulty  the gameplay is pretty easy and the puzzles are easy to figure out most of the time
if you cant figure out the puzzles there are ways to get ingame hints
although i did not buy the guide it may help some players outofficial nintendo super paper mario players guide
the difficulty is appropiate for the ratingsgamplay options  mario can switch from a d to a d world
although some may complain about the time limit i think the time limit works because it adds more difficulty to the game
the ability to switch between characters adds variation to the game so one person does not always have to play marioconsstoryline  for an rpg the storyline is awful
there is too much meaningless chit chat going on in the game that does not add any value to gameplay
although there are save points there are times when you have to go through the same chit chat over and over again if you die
i do not see the story appealing to anyone not even little kids
there is a lot to explore in the worlds but because of the dialogue i just wanted to finish the game as soon as possiblepointless puzzles  there are two that stuck out in my head
the first one being having mario hit a block or run in a hamster wheel for rubbies
this takes no skill and was the most boring part of the game
the second one being mario go through  fighting rounds where it only takes one hit to kill the bad guys and then going through a bunch of doors to find the end of the level
i would have rather had  rounds with more difficult opponentsalthough i have listed more pros than cons the weight on the cons is greater than the weight on the pro which is why i game the game  stars
the cons really do take away the enjoyability of the game
i think nintendo should make a sequal to this game and remove some of the unnecessary dialogue and puzzlesi rented this game from gameflycom and i hate it
they should have kept the mario side scrolling theme and kept with the mario formula run jump fly swim castle
im probably the biggest mario fan so ill just break down my pros and cons nowpros its mario in a paper thin form adorable the flip thing is sosocons i had to first watch the annoyingly long intro and they used slang
i swear i mustve hit the a button a million times to get thru all the dialogue
my  year old who has trouble reading would not have the patience to read all those dialogue bubbles rediculous
i let him read one bubble which he did pretty good but the dialogue just kept coming and coming utterly rediculous
probably the worst mario game nintendo ever cosignedi wanted to like this game
when the original tenchu stealth assassins came out in  it was a big step in gaming
for the first time since metal gear players were actually encouraged well sort of to be stealthy
interesting note on metal gear the only reason it was the first stealth action game is because the famicom didnt have the memory to handle all the bullets and character sprites on the screen at the same time so they had to make it about sneaking aroundanyway i really wanted to like this game
the problem is its an xbox  game that looks like it was made for the ps
the graphics are pretty horrible especially when you consider that assassins creed was released the same year
the voiceacting is pretty bad too but in that uniquely japanese way
since the game is entirely voiced in japanese i guess it contributes to some sense of immersion but it also means that if you dont speak japanese it ends up sounding corny
the music and sound effects are appropriate to a game about ninjasthere are two semiredeeming features of this otherwise disappointing game  you can finally customize your character
you pick your attributes skills outfits and weapons
thats cool
 there are a lot of missions  or so
on the other hand most of those missions are the same kind of things over and over but if youre enjoying it thats a good thing toothis is a pity game for the genre
complete desaponted
tenchu for the ps still the king of the hilltenchu z  circa good game has  missions and three different difficulty settings  createcustomize your very own ninja with lots of costume options and props like a crow on your shoulder or an extra sword on your back as well as change your hair style gloves boots pants and top the customizing doesnt just stop at looks this game has lots of unique and different moves as well as combos
some new abilities help you do things like run along walls and cling to ceilings game has large openended stages with a sandbox attitude finish missions the way you see fit online coop mode from two to four players while this mode is a little glitchly it is a nice featurebad most missions are pretty mundane and by the numbers not just the first few a few missions are for lack of a better term repeats of earlier stages this story is very bare bones and seems too heavily focused on feudal japan politics the graphics are old for a game that came out  this game looks at best like a game from the early playstation  days the enemy ai
is not very good and loses interest in following targets after they lose direct sight of their target
example if you get spotted by a guard jump over a small wall and the guard will not only not be able to follow you or know where you disappeared to but after a few minutes that same guard will lose interest and go back to his rounds higher difficulty settings dose not mean smarter guards or more guards but just that all enemies have better vision and can spot you much easierif it fits your taste this game only has three boss battles two of which are on the last mission westerners who in this game are spaniards or pirates are portrayed odd to say the least they come off very unmasculine when compared to all other characters even the woman after beating a mission you get ranked on your skill as a ninja really the game only counts how many times you got spotted and for how long versus how many stealth and normal kills you performed you get gold according to this and you get a ranking number from one to five five being the best the game has you earning money or gold on missions to buyunlock new costumes options abilities and items
new costumes options become available every few missions the ninja village just a very small hub world where you can select missions and changebuy costumes options abilities and items has the time of day set to the clock on your xbox  play at night and the ninja village is at night play during the day time and the ninja village is set during the day time
unfortunately this is not carried on to the stages them selves with  of the stages taking place at nightgame its most assocated too tenchu return from darkness xbox ps tenchu psadditional notes a demo of this game is available on xbox live marketplace using the right or left bumpers the  equivalent to playstations r and l makes the difficulty easier or harder per stage a few missions in this game have you kill members of the echigoya family this is note worthy because every tenchu game has its first mission killing a member of this family usually a corrupted merchant every mission  in all has at least one guard known as a tomikichi they are wearing the over sized roundcircle type of hats killing one on every stage gives you secret achievements beating the game unlocks a few new costumes options like modern day military uniforms with a stock gun m type that you can hold on your back its only a prop you cant use it and over sized animals heads like the ones you see at theme parksthe reason some reviews claim these cables work great and others say that they dont work at all is because the cables are not compatible with all official nes controllers
i have three but the cable only works with two of them
at first i thought it didnt work at all until i tested it with the other controllers and found that they functioned finei have seen this behavior in other offbrand controller devices
for example the mayflash snes controllertousb adapter does not work with all snes controllers
i have no idea why this is there may be an understandable reason but it is nonetheless very disappointing
im glad it works with some of my controllers but others will not be so luckyalso as other reviews have mentioned the male head on the cable is too large and requires a lot of force to insert or remove from the nes controller portthe cable i received seems to match pictures of the retrobit brand cable so i assume thats what i got
if you can find a brand other than retrobit try those instead but like with a lot of these kinds of retro accessories you might be stuck with this
its cheap so its not much of a problem to buy one to try but they are far from a perfect productwe were very disappointed in this product
it worked for connecting the regular ps  controller into the ps  but it didnt work for connecting the ps  guitar controller into the ps i liked this game at first but it gotten boaring its to easy to short and the same as the other dead or alive games
the graphics is good but the rest is the same like the other doa games only two new characters in this game but thats it
the combos are good but it lowers the opponiets bar to quick cause the attacks is to powerful like virtua fighter tekken street fighter and this one
this game gets real boaring after awhile so this is an okay gamegoodgraphical upgradestagesnice cg moviesonline modethats about itbadnot enough extra contentunlockable costumes are mostly just color variatedonline mode frequently lagscheap ai starting at stage no easy modegame gets boring after awhilethis was the only fighting game for the  when i bought it and to this day i still regret buying this
the ai will counter everything and juggle you for days at stage when you stack up all the negatives along with the ai this game isnt very fun
after i unlocked everything i bought virtua fighter  and this became obsoletefighting games have a sad tradition of horrible singleplayer experiences
dead or alive  continues this tradition wholeheartedly
it packs its singleplayer experience full of gruelingly difficult and frustrating opponents that can perform the trickiest combos at the drop of a hat
this would be fine on harder difficulty levels but im talking about normal mode
there is no difficulty mode easier than normal unlike in doa  so if you cant take the heat and you dont want to dedicate your life to the game dont botherthe boss of the game alpha is stupidly difficult to beat
memorizing her moves as you will have plenty of time to do while she beats you again and again does help ease the difficulty of the encounter but it cannot be denied that victory is only possible when she decides to let you win
fighting games typically work in a rockpaperscissors sort of way with the aforementioned items being replaced with attacksblockingthrows
well alphas throws scissors can bypass most of the attacks rocks in the game and have the ability to do more than half of your life in one hit
to make matters worse their animations take a long time
you can do nothing but watch helplessly as she pummels you into the electrified floor
and i almost forgot she can teleport at will escaping your attacks whenever she desires only to reappear behind you and snatch away your lifeso why play singleplayer at all
because you have to if you want all the costumes and charactersbut the game isnt all bad
the graphics are beautiful
most of the characters animations are equally gorgeous though some of the newer characters look like they need a bit more polish la mariposas kicks
most of the stages are nice and are about as ridiculous as youd expect in any fighting game dinosaursi think i would have really liked this game on a pc but the rts experience just doesnt seem to work on a console
i bought this game because i read reviews that said this was the best translation of an rts to console controls and now im thinking its just not meant to bethey have done some useful things with the controls but its just not enough
not being able to select all units of a certain type or all units on the map or easily jump to certain units makes this really frustrating
especially with infantry units its nearly impossible to tell a rifleman unit from a grenadier unit or the like in the middle of a battle so i just found myself selecting all the units on screen and telling them to attack most of the time which pretty much kills the very sophisticated tactical system they put into this game where each unit type has different powers and abilitiesi think it might have been okay if it let you move the cursor around like you would with a mouse but the cursor is always dead center of the screen like in a shooter so if you move the cursor you move the whole world with it
you cant select multiple units on screen without selecting all the units on the screen unless youve previously assigned them to a group number which requires getting them to be the only units on screen for you to select them for the group
youre constantly turning the camera to see whats going on which shifts the compass and makes navigation by looking at the minimap cumbersome at bestbottom line here is that theres a good game buried under a frustrating control experience
i honestly spent much more time wondering where suchandsuch unit went than i did planning my attacks
there were lots of options supposedly available to me for how to use different unit types but i normally couldnt even tell if they were working
i dont necessarily fault the developers as it does seem like a difficult prospect to translate a traditionally pc format to the console but i want people like me out there who have played rtss on the pc to understand that this is not the same experiencelooking at the screenshots of infernal it looked like my kind of game a max paynehitman kind of style
however it quickly falls apart not because its a bad game but simply because its a mediocre game with no innovationfirst the good  good graphics
runs well on my older computergraphics card
shooting mechanics are decent
no autotarget noob crap so thats a definite plusthe bad  you have to cannibalize corpses steal their souls whatever to gain health and ammo
you have to aim your target at their body and then wait for this animation thats too long to complete to get the goods
while this is cool for about  seconds it quickly becomes old
for gods sake its 
cant we bring something better into games than that
you have to raid the corpses because you need the ammo and health
but its not fun
its just a chore
and games are what we do to get our minds away from chores right
chores shouldnt be in a game
one innovation is featured  the stick to walls for cover mechanic of gears of war
unfortunately this idea wasnt good in gears of war and its not good here either
the cover mechanics of the call of duty series are far more intuitive and fun
the one good thing i can say about it being in this game is to show what a ripoff and lame idea it is in gears of waranyway the worst thing about infernal is just that it offers nothing new
run around and kill some guys  ok that gets old pretty quick
gamespot said it all  infernal embraces style over substance resulting in a dull and repetitive shooting experiencein the rd person shooter infernal you play as ryan lennox a former agent of heaven who recently joined the forces of hell
i had this game sitting on my shelf for a while before i finally decided to play through it
i can honestly say i wasnt missing much
while i finished it i found it a struggle to want to do so
i quickly lost interest in the game by the end of the first missionpros graphics
they were quite nice overall
however like so many shooters the sky and background was a solid unmoving sheet enemy ai was ok  however they were still stupid enough most times to come and find you instead of staying behind cover and firing at youcons voice acting was bad all around
all of the lines were unemotional and delivered verbatim as if read for the first time from a script
the main character and his female spy assistant were by far the worst the music was utterly painful
there was no atmospheric music something i really enjoy there was only cheesy repetitive action guitar rock
my most hated kind
now i know many younger players might enjoy the cliche driven angst rock while theyre shooting things up but i however do not
good action music in a game is essential for me and this game definitely did not have it
simply awful hell based powers were boring uninspired and hardly useful
the only i really used from time to time if i remembered was the charged shot
the planar vision felt added on for lack of a better idea and the teleportation was simply awful in every way
i absoluted hated when i had to use it to accomplish an objective bland level design
the only level that was sort of interesting was aboard the aircraft carrier ho hum bosses and boring battles especially the end boss friendly ai was awful
what little there was with the female character in the game i basically wanted to shoot her which sadly you cant trust me i tried
she prattled non stop saying come on ryan we dont have much time
hurry ryan
very annoying when youre trying to explore and or are low on healthammo and searching for power ups
she was constantly getting shot and in the way while always saying ill cover you then stand there and do nothing while enemies were trying to fill you full of holes poor jumpingfalling and cover mechanics
you could barely if at all jump over or climb on top of a crate
also you could fall off of an  scaffolding and die instantly
taking cover was cumbersome and always a chore searching enemies became more of a chore than a necessity
you could draw life from enemies to heal yourself and you could get ammo from them
however most of the time i just needed the ammo not the health
unfortunately you couldnt pick what you wanted at least not that i figured out
so basically i was wasting taking health from enemies just for the ammunition
a seperate key for each would have been nicethere are more things i could go on about regarding this game but its really not worth it
i really wanted to like this game but just couldnt
would i recommend it to a friend
definately notlike most console ports this game sucks
how can you even compare crappy console games like this to fear crysys and halflifethe graphics look like  and the game play is much the samepeople who play console game must have incredibly low expectations if this type of game can sell millions of copieshalo  was good in its day
the graphics were good back then and multiplayer was great
the story was ok except for the clifhanger ending
sadly it appeared this title would not be ported to the pc
finally  years later it comes out on the pc
great for people who didnt have an xbox or prefer pc controls right
wrong
three years is too long
aside from the obvious outdated graphics who could expect a  year old game to hold up against modern blockbusters
 microsoft not only made it require vista for no reason but they also force you to use games for windows livethere is no reason this game needs vista since its not even a directx game
in fact dx games run better on xp its been proven over and over
microsoft wanted to use this game to try to boost vista sales thats it
until a stable patch is released doesnt look like its going to happen probably due to lack of interest you wont be able to play it on xpnow about the games for windows live
initially that was the biggest ripoff in pc gaming history
pc multiplayer has always been free not including mmos and now they wanted you to pay to use it
aside from being a ripoff this made multiplayer a ghost town
now they wisened up and made it free but people have already given up on itnow if you can get past those two huge issues the game isnt even a good port
its buggy requires online activation and is generally a poor port overall
if you want to play halo  get it in the xbox
it works on the  too so there is no reason to waste your money on a poor portthe original halo was a groundbreaking title
the expectation for halo was so great that microsoft decided to greedily milk its own userspc users have been waiting for halo to be released for windows for over  years
now is too little too late
not to mention the shameless winvista promotionall these years microsoft was dragging its feet
why
the release of compatibilityhell winvista was coming  and halo was planed to boost sales
then winvista got repeatedly delayed  and so was halo result in  the graphics were cutting edge in  they are just presentable
even though the game requires an above average and quite expensive hardware configuration it actually looks worse than unreal tournament question why is halo only compatible with winvista since it does not take advantage of directxanswers   lets help sell those winvista finally
  there are hardly any affordable directxcompatible videocards available  lets charge the users for playing online with windowslive
the gameplay and overall presentation is not that different from the original halo
sure surfaces got better textured shiny reflections got added and now limiting and clumsy dualyield is available  but do these actually make a difference to a real gamerit is truly a shame that pc users get exploited in such shameless way
after all halo is getting released for xboxwow
we get the privilege of playing the previous generation game
arent we luckyi feel that the fighting in this game takes out the very soul of this beloved simulation game series
harvest moon is about living the quiet life befriending the neighbors marrying building up your farm raising your child that actually grows up
the fact that the original series is relaxing and a break from fighting games in general is what makes it so appealing in the first place
its uniqueness in lack of violence is what makes it a jewel
if you have an itch to fight in dungeons play the legend of zelda games
the way the stamina bars are set up makes it very limiting to how much you can do in a day
i also didnt like the whole catching your monsters livestock in the caves
it just makes it more work than its worth
the only good thing about this game really are the graphics which are indeed eye candy
for those who find the original harvest moon series boring then maybe this game is your cupoftea
but if youre like me and fighting isnt vital to your gaming and if youre also a huge fan of the original harvest moon series then i advise against getting this gamecartoonish graphics very little excitement just get links crossbow gun instead
it comes with a much better shooting gameeverything about this game gives me the impression that it was rushed out the door without being tested thoroughly and thats just sad
even the ds game was better than thisthe game loosely follows the plot of the fourth and final season of the show ending with the freeing of william from xanas control the gameplay is almost exclusively confined to lyoko with the option to switch between characters at will depending on which weapon or ability you want to use
also in addition to the four original sectors and sector  theres a new volcanic sectorto be fair the graphics are competent for the most part if a little vanilla and the voice acting is entertaining i especially like the option to switch between english and subtitled french probably the only opportunity american code lyoko fans will ever have to hear the characters voices as they were originally performed
its worth pointing out too that the bits in the digital sea were fun although the weapons took some getting used to
but everything else about this game just seems horribly broken to mefor one thing every time i played a level on the new volcanic sector the graphics started to lag and everything suddenly turned maddeningly slow and jerky
for another the characters weapons are completely unbalanced of the four only odd has a ranged weapon that can be fired while runningaelita has to completely freeze every time she fires and yumi and ulrichs weapons are so ridiculously shortranged that you almost have to be right on top of the enemies before they start to take any damageso youll probably end up using odd almost exclusively
incidentally why does ulrich start off only using one saber when you can see two hilts on his back
the health stations and checkpoints are scattered throughout the levels more or less at random and aelitas connectthedots block building and odds metroidstyle wall jumping take entirely too much getting used to
add in the fact that theres no camera control and you could hardly be blamed for suspecting that the designers are indeed out to get youbut the biggest slap in the face is the ending or the lack of one once youve beaten the game youre treated to a clip that lasts about five seconds and a credits sequence thats identical to the one from the show the one with the subdigitals song and the file folder
thats all the game has to reward you with hardly worth the effort it took to get there
i was also stunned to see that the game doesnt even allow you to explore kadic academy beyond a tiny strip outside the main gate and although the other characters from the show are hanging around talking to them yields almost nothing except the occasional goodie usually a still frame from the show or a bit of concept art
one thing i did enjoy was a gallery of entries from a contest that was apparently held at some point i dont know any of the details but it was still fun to see some original monster designs from the fans
i cant recommend this game for hardcore code lyoko fans because it doesnt add anything to the story that you didnt already get by watching the show and the game doesnt provide nearly enough background for nonfans to have any hope of following the plot
and either way the gameplay is so broken that its not worth the money
give it a missthis is one of the most irritating video baseball games i have ever seen
the controls are so complicated to learn and use that the game is just not fun to play
the only reason i can think of that so many people gave this game good reviews is that they played the game on other platforms where the controls were much simpler
the writers of the wii version of this game got so carried away with the new stuff they can do that they forgot to actually play the game to see if it was fun
well i can tell them now to not waste their time
this game is not fun
if this were the only wii game there was the wii wouldnt have sold  copies
fortunately its notbeing an owner of the logitech playstation  wireless controller i expected the new logitech playstation  cordless precision controller but it failed to meet the same standards
it stop working properly after about three weeks
i used it mostly for cod modern warfare  and found that pressing the r toggle a while to respond
the r and l buttons are extremely sensitive insofar as a tiny brush of the finger can set them off
use the money and buy yourself something better
trying going for the datel rapid fire ps remote controller
well worth the moneyi admit i bought this without researching as i have always been impressed with logitech products for both the pc and ps
however i am very unimpressed in the seemingly intentional hindrances they have put into this controllerfirst the good
i have had no problems playing ps and ps games the last few days with it
so i dont know where people are getting these interface issues but the ps has always had problems with backwards compatibility for some reasonnow the negative  this controller is ghz
not bluetooth
now i am looking around and i dont see any bluetooth nonsony branded controllers so maybe sony is not releasing the technology to interface with the ps or something however it should be advertised more
once again i have always trusted logitech and bought this without looking it up but i am very disappointed that i have to plug an adapter into my ps just to get this controller to interface
it has bluetooth for that reason leave the usbs for my external harddrivessecondly it isnt rechargeable
i couldnt believe it when i opened the package and aa batteries fell out
why would they leave out the ability to recharge without going to the store and buying batteries
if i wanted an ongoing cost like that i would have bought an off brand
i dont consider logitech some third name off brandthirdly the l r buttons are nicely rounded up to make them more trigger like
however they require a lot of pressure to push down
something that takes some getting used to and is still annoying when playing fighting games and fpss where response is criticali dont know why you would deliberately leave out recharging
fool me into thinking i didnt need to take up a usb slot
and make the buttons more awkward to usethis controller was the same price as the original six axis sony when i purchased
just get another sonybe aware that although the graphical enhancements are great several of the games cinematic sequences including almas first appearance have been altered and cut possibly for rating issues
also one of the most attractive rewards upon finishing the game the movie theater has been deleted completely making ninja gaiden sigma an overall inferior game when compared to ninja gaiden black for the xbox
get the latter if given the choiceill admit im not a serious gamer but im not useless with a controller
i normally play a game on the normal setting and hard once ive already beat it
this game though damn
there are no other diffuculty settings other than youre fed
i have always wanted to play this game since i saw it on the xbox but since i have only had playstations i never got a chance until now
i was so excited when the game came it
i put it in and started playing it
well right away i had a ninja running at me slashing me to bits
so i had to pause the game and read the manual to find out which buttons are what
so i start playing again with my new found knowledge of controls and work my way through the level all the while getting my butt handed to me
after several deaths i finally made it to the boss who then proceeds to slaughter me
now i will admit that i have little patience for this kind of stuff but a  minute first boss fight is rediculous
after the first  hours of frustrating playing and never getting past the first boss i took out the disk and threw it like a ninja star right into the wall
which then pissed me off more because i had just wasted  bucks on a game
im sure this game wouldve been much more fun if it had not been so stupidly hard and i had a little more patience
all in all id say rent before you buyhour of victory is an fps that tries out the whole diversity with the characters pitch and the awesomely derivative dialogue
the game is basically a weak fps with no real point and sense of what it wants to be with that said it still does have some value
you can get some easy achievements and it only cost me  so no real loss
basically this game is a very linear short and generic fps
if you see it for cheap maybe buy it but dont expect anything greatthis game is terrible
i was looking forward to a new name in world war ii shooters but this is just more of the same done worse
the controls were a little annoying but youd get used to them
graphics are no where near as good as they were saying they would be
missions were boring and character specialties sniping stealth etc
were more a nuisance then a fun addition to the genre
id suggest picking up call of duty  its half the price and at least  times as goodthis game was hyped up and it promised to be as good as the original unreal tournament and even have a good singleplayer but it seems that epic was more focused on the graphics not even the artdirection just the graphics and as a result we got an incomplete game that looks like a straight rip off of mortal kombat and gears of war
the overall feel of the game actually isnt bad in some areas it even feels better than the almost decade old classic it was supposed to surpass the weapons are perfectly balanced well except for the overpowered enforcer you start with and the game is fun for a little bit but youll quickly start to notice things lacking
there are hardly any maps for ctf and warfare gametypes and the rest of the gametypes are basically just different types of deathmatch
to add more to the list of problems ut weapons do not aim perfectly at the crosshair and there is no center weapon option which means unless you hide your weapon your stuck compensating your shots left or right
there are also more annoyances as well like dodging cant be disabled unless you tweak a file double jumping weve been complaining since kchampionship there is less online traffic in this game than there is in the original the players weigh like a gazillion pounds and cant jump high and various other things
overall this game was a total letdown and your better off finding a copy of the original ut or downloading nexuizi love turok but i dont like this version of the game n version was fun this version let me down i cant really put my finger on it but i dont like iti play shooters religiously rainbow  vegas cod  gears of war are arguably some of the best shooters around
and yes halo  was good as well
i remember seeing the turok game for the first time many years ago and being captured by the overall gameplay and of course the weapons
but this time around it doesnt live up to the hype
the graphics are not what you would expect for a next generation game no where near cod
also any game that doesnt offer a full coop story mode gets a negative notch from me
if halo is one of the biggest selling shooters of all time everyone should use the features they offer as the blueprint to build on like full coop story mode
sadly ill be taking this game back and will buy army of two insteadi like the weapons in this game and the cool enviroments and dinosaurs
i dont like how theres no blood when you shoot at the soldier guys
it is an m rated game but whatever
also the controls are kindof goofy and its really annoying when you keep on getting bumped overi really wanted to like this gameto me this game wasnt fun at all
the movements are slow and awkward there are times when you are being attacked and you cant even tell where its coming from mostly due to clumsy plodding controls that dont allow you to react as quickly as you would like
the graphics to me were far from next gen while very creative in theory the graphics are often muddy and not very well definedesp
when compared to a game like drakes fortune or even far cry which both had great jungle look to them
the creatures are cool but you are often outnumberedand with the sub par controls youre usually dead meat
i have been playing fpss for a long time and while im not the best im def not a novice
i know when i died because of my idiocy and when i died because of a control issue
this doesnt even control as well as games from  or  years ago like doom  return to castle wolfenstein tides of war and killzone
i guess i just found this really boring and not up to snuff
i didnt really care about the story and the action was more annoying than fun
i dont understand why this game wasnt made into the game it could have been
hard to believe no one spoke up and said hey this isnt good enough
or maybe they did and were promptly fired
play at your own risk a rental at bestwhen i first downloaded the demo for this game about  weeks before it was released i was pleasantly suprised by a title i would have no doubt slept on
the controls were tight the cars were nice the action was fast pacedand the game in general was just very entertaining
the demo gave you literally ths of the entire city to roam around in a few heart pumping races free roam as well as the main characters full capabilities from the jumpthe part that i find oddis that the demo is better than the actual game 
or should i saythe demo gives you so muchthat theres really no reason to purchase the actual game at all
the game in and of itself is basically repetitive go here do this get this person run from these people shoot at these guys while you drive wash rince repeatuntil you beat the game
and the storyline is really not even worth getting into
this is basically an arcade game that once you beat it you wont even think about it ever againpoint blank periodas weird as it soundsleave this game aloneand download its demo from xbox live  and enjoy a great arcade game for absolutely no cost at allill this game reminds me what a great game was all about on the original xbox
ill give credit that this games car combat system is alot of fun but the overall feel of the game serious reminds me of anything but nextgenthe voice acting from vin diesel is so horrible that i dont even pay interest the storyline anymore and with that said the game really doesnt even have a story at all
the graphics for the unreal engine arent all that great
the open city lacks life and any real sense of freedom since every corner you turn looks like the previous one you turned from
there is a complete lack of variety of cars and even the small amount you have to choose from all have the same engine soundit amazes me how underpar this game really is i think the creators spent too much time being intrigued with the car combat system and airjack factor that they simply only put half the effort in the rest of the game
the roads are always practically open you cant communicate with ai pesdestrians there are no buildings to explore nothing you can customize and the side missions are so boring that youd probably be better off watching a chick flickif this game drops down in price to say about  then id say give it try for a good crashing time but thats all this game really brings to the table
after playing such games like gta and saints row youll be so underpress with this game that youll really be asking yourself why you are still playing it quick and easy achievement points maybethe item came in good condition with manual
i only got this for the multiplayer online but didnt realize it was no longer available
the storyline i my opinion is pretty lame
i liked turok for the ps bestthis is a completely average game in fact the word average is the first that come to mind when i think about this game it is not bad but it is not good either
i am not going to spoil the story of this game as it is the best thing about blacksite however i will say as much as it is the typical military have discovered alien creatures and is trying to make super soldiers kind of thing you are playing a soldier who have to figure out what is going on and fix it
the story to is average however it is entertaining enough to keep you wanting to play through the gameblacksite area  start out very slowly you have some ai controlled teammates and they are not to smart making the start of the game tricky and a bit frustrating
the middle of this game is quite good and it is also here the story is best but then the game ends badly with the story being cropped in a way that just left me sitting there staring at the screen and wondering if the  game developers just suddenly ran out of money
the game is also quite shortthis game is nothing to write home about in the graphics department it would have been an impressive looking ps game which make it an ugly ps title the music is average have i used that word enough soon
the voice acting for blacksite is rather okey and do manage to bring some life into the characters
the gameplay is third person shooter which relay heavily on ai teammates which as i have mentioned before do not work all that wellall in all you could do worse than this game it is not horrible and have some good sides
if you can find this game cheap then it might be worth a play through however this is the kind of game you forget as soon as you put down the controls the plot while okey is one we have heard a million times before the action is forgettable the characters are plain in short this game might make a good filler game if you find nothing else to play but just to not expect to much of itblacksite has a great story a very current world with of course a scifi twist
the graphics are not the best on the ps its no call of duty both in graphics or gameplay the controls work well for shooting but the squad command is a joke
above all that the frame rate is awful every minor load will slow or stop the game for  seconds the audio from time to time will feel off sometimes youll hear an explosion from your grenade well after it already blew up
overall this game had serious potential i wanted to love this game i waited since june for this release and was very disappointedpros current story with elements of the war on terrorismthe shooting controls work wellcons framerate holds you back from enjoying the gamethe squad commands are not well utilized short campaign  hrsoh boy i was looking forward to this game
i love this type of game
sadly ba has some serious problems that indicate they either didnt listen to their qa testers or rushed to meet some arbitrary deadline
with a little more honing this could have been fantastic
instead its just okwhats good
the graphics for one
theres great detail in your environment enemies weapons etc
everything you could expect from a ps game is there although it doesnt look as stunning as call of duty  which ive seen a friend play on his xbox   explosions weapons effects and sound are all very goodalthough im still playing so far the weapons are hitormiss
theres a shotgunlike weapon thats basically useless
when i first found it i thought it would be perfect for close combat but its not
a regular combat shotgun might not look as futurecool in your hands but would work better
the ordinary assault rifle is very good though and sniper rifles can come in handy
you can also man turrets here and thereearly in the game theres an extended helicopter ride where youre manning a mounted machine gun thats very fun and wonderfully detailed
you can actually hear the helicopters hydraulics fading and recovering when you take hits
you battle a gigantic alien thing on a bridge and again everything looks fantasticive heard complaints about driving vehicles so far only hummers for me but its no better or worse than driving in any other game
forward or back on the left stick to go or stop steer with the right stick
i generally dont like driving in games but its no big deal
plus you can order teammates to man the hummers turret or get on it yourself although the game usually makes you drivetheyve thrown in some squad command play but its not really that useful
also your partners morale rises and falls depending on how well youre doing which is a nice twist
you can target specific enemies and have your squad concentrate on them which is nice especially at one particular spot where your buddy is hovering overhead in a helicopter and you can have him take out the enemies on the ground for you
some complain about the squad dialogue but these are grunts not james bondbut it takes no time at all for the lack of qa to seriously damage the fun though
ba uses realtime mini loads ala halo but theyre very jerky when they happen and sometimes freeze the screen for a couple of seconds
also when theres a lot going on the framerate suffers horribly
example  outside is a huge creature the size of a mansion stomping around im in a basement collecting ammo
occasionally little spiderlike enemies attack two to four at a time
even though most of whats happening is offscreen and your immediate environment is fairly calm shooting the spiders turned into a jerkfest of epic proportions
there was so much skipping that it was nearly impossible to do anything but keep spraying bullets and hope that when the graphics caught up youd hit something
yet at other times when theres a lot of action explosions etc
going on things are finebottom line  im going to finish it but wont keep it
ba is a sad sad case of underdevelopment
if the game so far is any indication the framerate and loading problems are probably only going to get worse
movement throughout levels is littered with stutters
im trying hard not to let it bother me but theres really no excuse for it and most people i know would be driven insane and throw the game disk into the nearest busy intersection
the story is getting interesting the combat situations and enemy ai are pretty good and so far the everchanging environments keep things interesting
but this game is badly brokentoo bad this didnt get more time to be developed
could have been a good game
as it is the game loads slow freezes and many problems during the game
waste of moneynothing innovative
horrible frame rate issues
crappy ending
average nextgen graphics
scant amount of weapons
too few types of aliens
the developers should have looked to insomniac for some inspiration
those guys made a vastly superior alien game in resistance fall of man
blacksite is not worth 
i even purchased the strategy guide because i was so jazzed about this title
didnt need it as there is very little in the way of strategy
very disappointed
going to sell itthis game is rubbish
bad graphics bad gameplay bad voice acting bad storythis is absolutely a dollar bin game
if youre looking for a cheap shooter to waste some time on there are plenty out there
id steer clear of this poopy title if i were youthe graphics are sub par and no far beyond what you might see on the original xbox
the game is very very short
its unpolished and buggyi did play online one match and that was a little better
but this pales in comparison compared to some of the better shooters like gears halo  and bioshock
i picked this and timeshift up at the same time and timeshift is a much better gameits probably worth a rental but not much morea couple years back midway updated their light gun shooter area  for the lastgen consoles in the form of an action scare and conspiracy theoryfilled fps that was surprisingly good
blacksite area  is more or less a follow up to the aforementioned game in which you play a soldier and find yourself searching for weapons of mass destruction in iraq only to uncover an alien conspiracy
the first thing youll notice about blacksite area  is that the game is boasting some spectacular graphics
the characters aliens areas and environments are beautifully rendered making the game a joy to look at but thats about it
the use of squad tactics doesnt work very well and youll mostly find yourself engaged in battles with your squad not doing much to lend a hand
it should also be noted that there are a fair amount of glitches and bugs that occur now and then ranging from graphical glitches to bugs in the gameplay elements
the singleplayer campaign is decent enough albeit much of the shock value and scares that were featured in the last area  game are absent
the multiplayer mode is uninspired and boring to say the least as well which is even more disappointing
for all its flaws though blacksite does offer some solid moments of intense action and the political commentary does conjure a smirk
all in all though blacksite area  is a disappointing fps that could have been so much better than what we get here
it is worth a rental at least for fps addicts or fans of midways area  license but other than that blacksite can be avoidedthe good superb audiovisual presentation decent storythe bad paper thin content six hours isnt very long lackluster multiplayerfirst and foremost this game has nothing to do with the area  for pc xbox and ps that came out four years ago even though its made by the same people
blacksite uses the unreal  engine and does a pretty damn good job with it
everything looks superb and fantastic and youll be visually pleased the whole way
the downside to this is there is massive slowdown during large firefights which can really bitethe game has you playing cpt
pierce who is an army marine trying to fight off an invasion of infected government experiments
through the game you have only four maybe five weapons a couple vehicle segments think gears of war and a couple of helicopterturret segmentsthats it
while the game isnt boring thanks to its six hour length the content is paper thin
the story is rushed and it feels like the developers just rushed this game out way too earlythe online multiplayer isnt very fun thanks to the few weapons you have
there are also only maybe six different enemy types through the whole game as well
this game is a great weekend rental but not worth the  purchasei was expecting great things for this game since crystal dynamics was the developer for this game and was responsible for the great tomb raider legend that i really liked
i played and enjoyed the game up until the centaur boss level and after spending several days trying to figure out the move combo that would get rid of them i gave up and uninstalled the game
a few weeks later i reinstalled it started at the beginning and played right up to same level only to be frustrated again
ive played many a game recently including quake  prey half life  half life  episode  brothers in armsroad to hill  and the great tomb raider legend all were fun and had frustrating moments as most games do but those moments were eventually overcome without the help of cheats or downloaded save games and you continued on with the game
not with this one though
i hear crystal dynamics has another tomb raider in the works
i hope they go back to tomb raider legend for inspiration and dump whatever they did wrong with this oneat first game was smooth visuals like the one before it legend was too but offered more fun and better controls
saving the game can only happens at certain intervals and several times conditions were so hard to accomplish i would have to play a hundred times or more to finally pass the exercise or choose to bypass it due to extreme problems with improper control or it just being too hard to accomplish
many times i checked for updates but none to be found
touched upon a blog for help and a few suggestions were found from new friends but seemed mostly like buggy glitches in the game were worked around somehow other than won by sharpening ones expertise in the game
about half way through i decided to uninstall the game as it became so increasing difficult i was soon just trying to move on without accomplishing very hard tasks that were needed to find relics and such
no sense in continuing if having to leave behind all the relics
the new wall traversing was sorely buggy and hard to manage as i think it was really intended
i would have to get past that which didnt work correctly even after a myraid of prevously hard jumps and grabs and then the event was even timed on top of it all
i felt like some cruel game producer was trying to torture me
that which started as fun entertainment soon became torturous and painstakingnot to mention that the puzzles cant just be solved by oneself anymore they are so hard i found them impossible to do without a guide from the internet or a book
what fun is that if you have to read how to solve something all the time
it should be doable without having to use a guide
just too hard and a problem instead of a fun mystery sorry i just gave up
very dissapointed but legend was great so i may go back in a year or so and get some of the older tomb raiders that were just before legend and play them
right now i am disgusted that i paid some  for this one and disenchanted from trying others for some time to come for now
i will probably just not play them anymore the way i feel right now
she didnt even look sexy with some top on up to her neck
couldnt change her apparel she would get dirty as time went on
was like she needed a shower and clean clothes disgusting
sorry maybe i can sell it  no wouldnt want to ask money for something as frustrating as this guess i will just eat it
too bad was expecting something way better
how they can go to so much trouble to ruin a good game is beyond me
why do they do that
something with so much potential and just ruin it
sadi cant stand this game
i played through the first few levels
the graphics are great and the concept is good but the gameplay is awful
controling lara takes time to get used to and even then its frustratingtomb raider anniversary is a remake of a classic game
i suppose for fans of that classic game it might be a great deal of fun seeing it with updated graphics and a new engine
however if youre not a tr fan and are coming at this cold you might want to try something elsei havent played the original tomb raider but i have previously played iii and last revelation
i didnt particularly enjoy either of them in fact the latter bored me so greatly i hardly got past the rd level but the premise was interesting at least in theory
when i saw anniversary and perhaps more importantly saw its price i decided to give the series one more chance
after all id heard from a lot of fans that the original was the best one by far
this has certainly been true of a lot of other game franchises so i figured what the heckthe game engine and graphics are both well done
detail is excellent and lara crofts character model is one of the better ones ive seen in any game
the areas look like real albeit somewhat fantastic ruins and enemies look commendably intimidating
you can perform a wide range of stunts as is to be expected from previous games in the series and many of these will really have you watching with bated breath
one word of warning if youre scared of heights this game might not be your cup of teathe game is largely puzzle based though its interspersed with action sequences
occasional cutscenes have some interactivity but usually nothing more taxing than simple directional keypresses
for the most part youll be jumping off ledges grabbing convenientlyplaced handholds and swinging from ropes or equally convenientlyplaced monkey bars
there is a free targeting mode but its rarely useful for anything
if lara sees a point of interest a 
symbol pops up over it
you can interact with simple objects pull levers and pick up ammo or weapons
aside from that theres not a whole lot of complexity to the gamewhere tr revelation fails and badly is in the control scheme
im running it on a windows pc and its patently obvious that the controls were designed for a gamepad
many of the combinations you have to perform are extremely unwieldy using a keyboard and mouse and the mouse in general is underutilized
for example locking on enemy targets requires you to face in that direction
you lock on with the right mouse button and fire with the left
however when maneuvering youll find you occasionally lose lock for no apparent reason
you then have to reorient on the enemy with wasd lock back on and get back to business
additionally the game necessitates keymashing to recover from certain conditions such as mashing the leftright keys to get out of a grab
if you shoot enemies enough they will perform a charge maneuver
in this case time briefly slows a la matrix or max payne though a bit less pronounced and you can perform an adrenaline dodge by locking on and rolling left or right at the appropriate instant
if you succeed in doing this you can perform a head shot by timing clicks and this will either instantly kill or badly damage the enemythis sounds like a cool feature but it is badly badly broken
i have played this game for several days now have had countless opportunities to perform an adrenaline dodge and have only been able to do it about  times
by this i mean just the dodge not the headshot followup
it really is nearly impossible to pull off and whats more is that you need to do it to kill bosses
bosses are literally impossible to kill without this move which is a horrible design decision on crystal dynamics part
it turns a badly implemented feature into a blocker and thats unfortunately as far as many people will get
once again im sure this is easier to do with a gamepad and have read as much on various guides and forums but it is insanely difficult to pull off on a keyboard
keep in mind this is coming from a veteran fps player i have better than average reflexes for a pc gamer and i still cant reliably pull this move off
ironically im actually wishing my pc was a lot slower since that might assist in getting the timing downthe second major issue with this game as with all other tomb raider games is that youll frequently encounter puzzles that make little or no sense or offer very little in the way of clues
if youre not the type that likes to spend very long periods of time backtracking and looking around you might end up frustrated very quickly
additionally the camera is strangely limited in sweep and angle and you have very little control over it
this can make it quite difficult to reach certain areas especially if you arent good at remembering a rooms layout
this is rather inexplicable since mouse movement is essentially redundant
why not map that to a free camera viewthe bottom line is that tomb raider anniversary is a nice looking pc game with a console control scheme
ive seen other console games ported to the pc such as demon stone and those suffer from the same issues
the big problem with this game is that it requires the player to do things that require very rapid or perfectly timed key combinations
it would be ok if this was optional to progress in the game but it isnt
from what i understand this wasnt the case in the original
perhaps they should have stuck to thatdue to its low cost and updated graphics fans of the original or other series titles might like anniversary
if you didnt like the previous games this one most likely wont change your opinion
as for me anniversary has convinced me that tomb raider just isnt my sort of gamei tried to play this game but it really makes no sensethis is the first game that i bought without trying it firsti wont do that againi find it hard to like squad shooters
your squad members are either dumber than the bullets that mow them down or get in your way
this is advertised as a squad tactical gametactics
what tactics
giving squad orders had never been considered tactics  why should we start now
no this is in no way a tactical game
save that description for say deus ex or even the rainbow six seriesmoreover your squadmembers respawning subtracts substantially from the games immersion factor
on the other hand the enemy ai is quite high
you still can pretty much finish the game by rushing headfirst but the game makes you work  and pay  for italthough not cutting edge the graphics are very nice the lighting and shadows realistic and the environments and objects are almost all interactive blacksitearea  shares the same environmentinteraction routines with a much better game strangehold  if you like check out my review on it as well
the conspiracy brewing atmosphere is successfully conveyed  and the weather effects add another nice touchon the other hand the enemy designs they managed to fumble
the aliens are a collection of a mix of poorly developed and lets say older ideasdo you remember the halflife crabs
checkdo you recall halflife antlions
check only with more horns and with firepower  and a mine that pops out when left for deaddo you remember the coffeenicotineaddicted aliens in men in black
check only larger and meanerdo you remember the big bugtank in starship troopers
check only more segmentedwhat finally tipped the scale against this game however was the poor quality control clipping was too widespread stuttering too frequent and freezing unavoidablea good effort that barely makes par
the overall feeling of this game is that it got started after a very creative brainstorming  but then was left to developitselfonly for conspiracy buffs willing to overlook its serious flaws
and even then wait for the price to dropthe good decent shooting fun some interesting localesthe bad multiplayer is dead only a few weapons only a handful of enemies dumb ai useless morale and squad commands extremely short paperthin story nothing to really do with area i played this about  years ago and even then it wasnt all the impressive
this game has nothing to do with the under appreciated area  that came out years ago despite being made by the same studio
in fact the game has nothing to really do with area  at all except you fight through rachel nv and there are aliens
the game is a days worth of mediocre entertainment at best
the story is paperthin with something about a government experiment where they are trying to create the perfect soldier using prisoners and homeless people
the experiment breaks out and you are fighting off a weird paramilitary plus xeno aliens
the characters arent interesting and this is by far just a b grade experiencethe worst part about the game is the lack of content
only a few weapons like less than  and a handful of enemy types makes for just a typical shooter experience
there are a couple of large boss fights that were epic at the time but now they feel too scripted and stale
the graphics are pretty bad since this uses the unreal engine  from years ago so there are badly scripted explosions crappy ai and a useless squad command and morale system
you can send your two buddies somewhere but it makes no difference because they wont shoot anything most of the time
if you get shot a lot your morale will go down but i actually didnt notice this do anything because the ai is so dumb anyway
there are a few vehicle sequences which suck and all the weapons feel the same except the couple of alien weaponsthe multiplayer is nonexistent because the servers have been long gone but you can grab the game for less that  on amazon
the game lacks the greatness of its predecessor with a lack of interesting story characters and scripted cinematic events
you can go around collecting dossiers but other than that this is bare bones at best
the game had a lot of potential but was executed poorly with lazy design and shortcuts
why should you bother playing it
mainly for fans of the first game or who just want a fps fix for a few hoursi feel i should point out what a deadend this game can be on the pc
i have installed it on an excellent machinebut theres a bug that kills the main characters voices but leaves all other sounds intact
installing the patch that hopes to address this problem causes the game to stop responding to keyboard inputs
and because it is a console port your opening screen is held at press enter to continue
better to tie the enter key to the x button than to maybe also take a few minutes and tie the mouse click to it toothe other thing im writing the review for is to warn you that support for the pc appears to be almost nonexistent
even the official site for the game does not provide a support link and shame on them
midways site will give you release notes and patch notes but warns you that contacting anyone isnt something you can count on as it wont be answered very soon
with no support information forums or online documentation on the bugs im stuck hoping they answer my email some day
at this point im not getting my hopes upthe larger problems  console ports to the pc are often hastily cobbled together poorly supported and software companies allow showstopping bugs to get to store shelves because any time spent troubleshooting costs money and slows down sales
blacksite area  just has the misfortune to have hit on all threewhen i was growing up i was a huge mortal kombat junkie
mortal kombat  really broke so many barriers as far as oneonone fighting games go and i remember spending countless hours learning fatalities and mastering my skills with all of the characters
id be at the arcade too plugging quarters away to check out the latest mortal kombat installments and couldnt wait for them to be released to a gaming systemso after buying a ds i was pretty stoked to see this game and figured i knew what i was buying with all the experience i had with mortal kombat games
i must have spent about  minutes playing this game and havent touched it since
its just so frustrating to go out of your way and spend  dollars on a brandname that you trust only to be let down by some foolish programmers choices
fatalities have always intrigued me and i love performing them and when i was younger i remember performing all of them with general ease but with this
forget about it  you have about a millisecond to perform a fatality which is listed on the screen which should be very convenient but the chances of actually executing them are darn near impossible
its just so aggravating when you swear youre hitting the right combination of buttons and nothing happensjust such a huge letdown that i cant pick this game up thrash on some fair fighting computer enemies not ones that dont even let you fight normally and use the special moves the game itself created because the enemies are in this robot win mode rip some heads off and be done with it except im left with a game i want to throw against the wall because the programmers were too busy eating cheetos than actually making a user friendly gamei havent played this as a player game but i imagine its way fun that way  but if youre a player gamer like me please please please dont waste your money like i didand the puzzle game
pfff  what a bleak attempt to make a fun addition not only is the puzzle game boring they topped it off with automatic fatalities that are worthlessly recycled guts and gore that gets old very very fast  ugh  i hate getting ripped off
just the chance you take sometimesi had fun playing on this game for a few days but ultimately some of the missions get a little too unnecessarily difficult which is mostly due to bad game mechanics
the environment of barcelona is unique and looks well done at a glance but if you get out of your car and walk around you will see there isnt much detail
the cut scene graphics and the faces of the characters are awful
ive seen better on ps
and this was a  release so no excuse there
the game seems like it was rushed to be put out probably trying to capitalize on the release of fast and furious  which also came out in  and marked vin diesels return as a main character to the series
its another instance of a gaming company caring more about cashing in than producing something of quality
not that the game isnt fun at times but the fun is overshadowed by difficult missions to progress a story line that just isnt that entertainingfinal grade cgameplay presumably okay for multiplayer addictsgraphics average flat grounds and environments nothing to write home aboutsound again average  nothing that we havent heard beforei bought this game because the trailers looked fantastic and the selfproclaimed best singleplayer everdont be fooledthis is a multiplayer game only
i had to spend sixtydollars to learn this
if you like multiplayers then this is your average runofthemill multiplayer
however if you are like me and really only enjoy playing singleplayer consider yourself warned the singleplayer campaign consists of mulitplayer maps with ai competing against you
no bosses no breathtaking missions just capture the flag against aiive never been so disappointedoh wait then theres alone in the darkthis game looks great however the phrase looks arent everything rings like a sad song for this game
it is a fun game in small doses but certainly not worth even  let alone the  they ask for usually
they simply focused on looks
the game is good if you only like to kill in arenas and that is all no imagination no fear nothing like the unreal gold survival horror games
this game is even worse than the other unreal games
i fell in love with unreal and unreal gold but i also loved unreal tournament  for ps
this game does not compare with that evenit is fun but i have so many complaints with the total lack of imagination
the game says single player campaign is back as if it were going back to the old unreal days where you could have the survival horror genre single campaign where you had tried to escape a foreign planet inhabited by humanoid incredibly sophisticated and powerful lizardlike warrior monsters that would wreck you up quite badly with one mistake plus have the unreal tournament feel online as was in the original unrealnope
what they should have said was same stupid game as all the others but with new graphics
they should put a big label on the game saying buyer beware game developers have no ability for creativity
thats about it
sad o sayt he graphics were not all that great though most people still could not max out the graphics a sign of a poor engine although the unreal engine is world renowned it has seen better daysi think this game is about to go extinct
maybe they will reach out to their old fans before they die and make a new regular unreal return to the hell planet of doomness and actually have fun this time aroundi have to say the games graphics are nothing short of cheap
but besides that fact the game is cool and all except you have limited creativity
i got stuck many times trying to figure out what to do or how to do things
the tutorial was of limited help when it came to the real gameplay
i struggled and eventually just gave up never to play again
i hope to sell it soonok i am an older gamer
played zork  when it came out the original anyway
my wife and i love the harry potter series
i bought this for her for christmas to play on our wii
the controls were difficult often impossible
some areas the camera blocked the view of where you were supposed to go
sometimes there are places you just stand with no indication of what you have to do other than the marauder map giving you clues
the bridge scene was the final straw
tack it up to me being old if you will the bridge scene where the kids were beating up nevil took me  minutes to find out that we had to do a spell at the torches  feet above usthe animation is ok the graphics are pretty bad
whenever a character talks they open their mouths
the teeth are just  pixel thick and look like white cardboard in their mouths
you can often see through the back of a persons head as you are moving around
overall this game was rushed to line up with the movie release and therefore it is pretty badin addition to all the other comments already posted id like to add a few of my own frame rate issues everywhere
the poor little wii doesnt seem to be able to keep up with the game engines insane level of detail leading to really choppy scenes and movement
thing is the wii should be able to handle this  i think it was just poorly ported
random weird sound effects
there are some rooms where you enter and it sounds like youre under a herd of stampeding cattle for no reason
its annoying and after a few minutes in the room it just makes you want to return the game for a refund
you dont feel particularly heroic
going around levitating things for other wizards who apparently cant master the most basic of spells so they ask you to do it feels contrived pointless and ultimately not why we play video games
there are several places in the game where i swear im not playing harry potter any more but instead im playing box stackertm
for those of you who dont read the onion go google for it
youll get what im saying then
people have mentioned the lurching pace of the videos i describe it as if someone had rented the dvd version and accidentally sat on the fastforward button
i mean how hard would it have been to add some sort of crossfade between scenes
come on
the occlumency portion of the game is just plain laughable
i literally laughed out loud at how ridiculously simple and boring it wasto sum up clearly this game was rushed to market
its frustrating to play the game itself is a series of boring chores and the rewards are nothing but selfserving videos of the actors and ea staff telling you how great the game is
its nice having a bunch of dvd extras but not for the price theyre asking and not for the price of  hours of my time
seriously even if youre a huge harry potter fan this just isnt worth iti give it two stars for the voice acting music and environment and hurling benches at students is at least some fundaughter writing reviewi was honestly expecting this game to be better
i thought it would be like colosseum or xd and i was terribly wrong
there is a story mode to this game but not to the extent of the shadow pokemon games
really the main goal on this game is to conquer the many colosseums this game has to offer
i didnt even know that until after i beat them all
i was excited for this game and when i got it i had fun
but since i didnt have any of the ds games at the time it was truly disappointing and the game was basically useless
except for looking at the pretty graphics and playing over wifi connection
but unless you have a ds game youre going to get owned over wifi everytimeim hoping we can get a shadow pokemon game soon and nothing like thisthis was fun for a while but it really is a one note game
it goes no whereat first it was great and fun
we had some friends over and were competing
after about  minutes it starts to turn into the same thingupdated review the first paragraph is my updated review and the nd paragraph is my original reviewafter using this browser for a few days i have raised my rating to   stars
my original expectations were a bit too high
while this browser is slow the design is better than i orignally gave it credit for
so if you are looking for a browser that is quite functional and are not in too big a hurry then this is certainly worth the money
i am happy i got it
just wish it could be a little fasteri had really high hopes for this browser especially since it was out months ago in europe so i thought any weaknesses would have been fixed
unfortunately that is not the case
it is very slow poorly designed and has problems with the touch screen working
it is ok to browse if you have no other way of browsing but overall is more of a pain to use than is worth it
i truly hope they have the ability to download patches to make this browser work even moderately better
really surprised since the opera wii browser is awesome and the big reason i bought a second wii
this one feels like it is only  complete
as for the previous poster the ds is an amazing system and while the psp is also a great system it does not compare to the ds for pure enjoyment
i have both and love both but mostly use the dsthe software is stupendous and would earn  stars on its own
unfortunately for todays internet the ds just doesnt have the power you need
no flash is liveable but the render times are cripplingif all you want to do is read the news and check your email this may be worth it
i switched my nytimes subscription to weekends only and just read the weekday news on the ds now
unfortunately thats about the limit of this devices usefulness
its simply not practical for regular web surfing or reading linkridden blogsbut it is a runnerup for the title
the game doesnt even live up to its weak premisebargain bin junkthe game had some potential but was defeated by poor graphics silly gameplay difficult vehicle controls and an enemy that can make headshots while running at a mile away
spend your money on better discount gamesif you dont get the stunt right you have to start over
this is not anything like the stuntman games on ps
i will give this game a few more tries but my rating stays the same
it is more annoying than funthey appear to be of decent quality and worked very well at first but after a few months the color became very washed out and there was a lot of distortion in the soundi was hoping for more of a roleplaying game akin to the tabletop fantasy game this is based on
unfortunately this is just another shooterhonestly i would be mad if i bought this game brand new
the price when it came out no story
practice mode is ok the online mode to me sucks but fun and another thing that gripes me is you have to earn mony to get weapons and powers to be a threat thats is kinda awesome but if you die you have to buy them again
i like it and kinda hate it at the same time because you hit some one and now you attack them first and you die in the end of the confrontation when you hit them with at least  or  shots and then your deada
the thing is people get mad at you and vote to kick you out when they now by your ranking your new and trying to learn to me this game is a toss up for people that never heard of shadow run thats my two cents take it for what you willi have to say my only knock against the game is a single story line instead of the player vs player element
especially for  is a bit muchlike most players of the pc versions of this series i absolutely loved the first  games
but when all the reports of how horrible the controls and game play was for gof i was sufficiently scared away from buying it
for months that is
i did eventually break down and bought the game cheap after it had been out for a while
expecting the absolute worst i was definitely surprised at how much i actually liked it
it was different from all the previous games and did require the use of a controller which i had to buy to play it properly
but i did find i was happy with the game
its because of that i did not wait for the reviews of ootp but went ahead and preordered it
i just started playing it today and im already thinking about puting it up for salethe controls on ootp are absolutely terrible
even with a controller
its incredibly difficult to aim cast a spell especially wingardium leviosa and even just to walk is a royal pain
you cant even look up or down at least i havent found a way toi tried using the keyboard after i found the controller so problematic but that was even worse
so i went back to the controlleraside from the controlls the game play is at times choppy even on a really fast comp
the characters are not impressive the attempt to digitize the original actors doesnt always work like hermione looks pretty bad
and watching the missmatched mouth movements on all the characters can make you cringe
ltbut i suppose i could overlook all of that if the game were engaging
granted ive only just started the game and just got to the part where they have their first dada class but so far i really havent done anything
swept a few patches of leaves and repaired a couple of thingsplayed a game of chess and a card matching game aka exploding snap but thats all
maybe the game play picks up as you move along but at this point in the other games loads of stuff would have happened by now
moaning myrtle keeps appearing talking about all the cool things in a hidden room but so far i havent gotten the sense of any place to really explore
there are some doors still locked but the game play is such i dont even have the anticipation to know whats behind them as i would in any of the other hp gamesill play some more on it since i went and spent the money but i definitely dont see myself finishing this game as of right nowmaybe this game is more fun on a console but looks like the hp series is dead on the pcthe graphics are beautiful
now that is out of the way there are too many problems with this game to give it a good ratingyou will sit through copious dialogue that you cannot skip through
at one point after rescuing a scientist in a mine you encounter a standoff with the enemy geth and a krogon
you will die here
many times
theres no cover and if you are not playing as a soldier you really have no resources to defend yourself
i can handle dying in a game it happens all the time
problem is in this game you have to sit through about  minutes of dialogue to get to the spot where you will die
do that ten times
yeah  minutes of the same dialogue over and over will bore you
the developers made some very poor decisions about save pointload point placementanother problem is the idea that your character cannot use certain weapons because you are untrained
untrained to weild a shotgun
are you kidding
your character is a career fighter but never spent a day learning to aim a rifle or shotgun
this forces you to select the soldier character class a wasted opportunity
the sniper rifle function has its problems too specifically it fails to register hits from certain distances as though the enemy target is not distinguished from the background its standing againstwhile this game gives the impression of a vast openended sandbox type of game it is actually very linear
most of the choices available to you are false choices with no impact on the outcome or direction of the story
the story is going to go where it will regardless of what your character says or doesmass effect is basically a boring frustrating game
there are tons of rpg and third person shooters that are better than this onekeep in mind i dont generally like d shooters
i bought this game as a scifi rpg which it isnt
after a few days play the only rpg elements i have found is that you get to pick  team members out of  or so to run out in front of you and block your shots when the badguys rush inthis game world has a lot of background and youll spend your first couple play sessions reading about all the various races and their political struggles then youll spend another couple days on some tedious shooter runs then youll go pick up a good game insteadmy disc had a problem with freezing so i never had a chance to try and play all the way through the game but this is not a game for anyone but very serious gamers
the instructions are quite complex the controls hard to manage as it takes many minutes to understand what they are for
i found it the least user friendly xbox game i have owned
it was almost a relief when i finally gave up trying to play through the freezes by restarting new games
even using your weapons to shoot an enemy was unusually difficult for us as you didnt know what that particular weapons capabilities were without reading long instructionsif you are into games with minutes and minutes of scenes and dialogue before you ever get to play and you are experienced or patient enough to learn the intricacies then this might be a super game
it wasnt for usi bought this game with high expectations from everything i heard and yes while the game does have depth it is also extremely boring and stretched out not much fun to play just time consumingall of the reviews are raving about this game
thats what convinced me to buy it
i kind of regret doing so
i find the story novel and interesting but the gameplay horrendous
simply put its no fun
gunfights are boring
the real action is too few and far between
its funny seeing him jog one minute and then randomly spirnt a second laterits not a great game because the best part of the story
regardless of how great or original it is the gameplay must be up there
with this game it isntafter about hrs forced myself past an hr i can already say this is one of the most boring games ive yet to play on the  i tried to convince myself that it was going to get better but it didnt and now im mad because i wasted  at blockbusterreasons being repetitive the conversations are too damn longlame sound effectsnot to mention this game ripped off of halos designs and characters as well as a whole bunch of other games
its just boring i dont even have to try and convince the average  player on how lame it is in fact im surprised people have given this more than  starsno action no fun factor no life as you could care less about the miscellaneous charactersif your looking for a good xbox rpg go with knights of the old republic now that was funi thought this was going to be a big open world like oblivion but its not
its really lame and the cover system sucks really bad
i think the voice actings good and the graphics are nice but thats not enough to make this game enjoyable the fighting is just anti climatic and when you kill somone they always fall in this sortof wierd arching position its really wierd and hard to exlpain but i guess that means that there still using canned animation which is kindof lamethe only good thing about this game is the graphic
it is absolutely beautiful
other than that it is extremely boring and slow pace
if you love knights of the old republic then youll feel at home
otherwise you have to get to know all the options equipments weapons different alien races space ships characters
if you love fps this game is very dissapointing
after giving  days to try this game i decided to return it back to gamestopi cant understand how anybody could rate this game over  stars
this is one of the worst games i have ever played due to mediocre graphics bad framerate i thought i was playing on a slow pc sometimes and excrutiatingly boring side missions
i actually bought mass effect  first
i started playing it and decided to play the first one
i figured i would finish  and go back to   me did not have the technical issues as me did
anybody that says the graphics in me is great must be color blind
how this game got past quality control is beyond methis is one of those games whose creator does not understand what a portable game should be
they geared the game to be played for  maybe  minutes tops
you take a short quest all of which have little variance then you head into the dungeon to complete it
the quests are always the same
kill a target monster find an item find a person etc
so you take a quest enter the dungeon take another enter the dungeon again take anotheryou get the point
youll be visiting the same dungeon quite a few times before you can take the quest that will take you to a new dungeon
dont get too excited though its just a change in scenery youll be doing the same short repetitive questsif youre played the game children of mana for the nintendo ds youve already played this game
its basically the same thing albeit with a better combat system and graphics of courseits really quite sad as the game could have been great
your character even has dynamic armorweapons showing whichever armorweapons they are using
but all is wasted on a substanceless boring miniquest rompid recommend giving star ocean star ocean first departurea try instead
it uses d sprites instead of d models but its a similar active combat rpg except it has a great story with very likable characters great voice acting and is great fun all the way throughthis one not so much
i strongly recommend you pass on iti dont know where this game went wrong
okay its irritating at first but when i  got the hang of it i was ready to blow up some planesits fun at first  but then i played some more levels and i was asking myself  is that it
i mean all the levels are pretty much the same
so youre in a plane  then other planes an start shooting at you and youre ordered to shoot them downi did not even finish this game
so hey maybe you should buy itor rent it and play it all the way  through and possibly it will get betterbut it just did not fly with mefirst of all i love madden
love franchise mode
got this for my pc so that i cuold use a xbox controller to play itno i dont have an xbox just the controller and that worked fine after i downloaded the patch
was addicting to my franchise for days and if thats all the time you want out of this game its a great buy
however after i week i want to add created players to my franchise and start a franchise with a created teamthings you could do in  well you cant do that anymore or atleast i cant figure it out
after three seasons all my players unexplainably had an awareness jump to  even my backups
you dont have a choice in this and now i dont have to fun of making my team better by myself
then if you play the games long enough you will notice its like the game cheats for the computer
you will fumble the ball  times a game while the computer never does
corner backs will make plays on balls when they were running the other way and werent looking
the first season i played lt broke the rushing record by over  yrds
ive gone undefeated and lost the coach of the year to three loss teams
then if you go even deeper the team ratings are outlandish
the patriots who lost the super bowl are the all time greatest team
the texans are rating below the european leagues
there are year specific teams that are better than thier all time teams
ex the  vikings who lost to the steelers are better than the all time steelers
then there are real glitches my game sounds only work half of the time
bottom line the premise if real fun but the execution is terriblethe game was nothing special overall but the thing that made it unplayable for me were the controls
while some adjustment can be made options are limited
keyboard and mouse or keyboard alone was unplayablewhy when hitting a ball over a sand trap the ball suddently dives into the sand trapinstead of landing on the greenim not big on comic books
not even when i was a kid did i enjoy any of the old marvel superheroes so this review will be purely on the game itself rather than any ties i have to the comic book characters in itlet me start by saying that i did not get this by choice
it came in a bundle pack that i received with my xbox  so i didnt really have high expectations for ultimate alliance from the getgo
anyways here is my reviewgraphics 
i was very pleasantly surprised when i first put the disc into my xbox to see how terrific the graphics were on the opening cutscene
it was almost photorealistic and that really boosted my enthusiasm to play the game
however as in all games the graphics arent as good in gameplay as they are in the cutscenes and my enthusiasm was shot right back down when i saw how average the ingame graphics really were
a lot of the computers and such used in the game are hideous to look at and reminded me of the graphics from the game fighting force for the n
of course not everything looked that bad but it was a disappointment for sure
all of the character wearing dark clothes spiderman human torch looks constantly wet and all of the characters wearing light clothes wolverine thor seem to be way too bright almost with a light bulb inside of them
this game was released quite a while ago and for the time the graphics were good but that wont help you much if you are looking to buy this nowgame play 
as you begin to play you will think how nice it will be to have more than one character at your disposal at all times
infact you can travel with  different superheroes at one time though as you begin to think about the dynamics of game play you begin to realize how hampered it will be to play as one of the  seeing as the camera has to show all  characters at once and that with so many characters the individuals cant have as polished of combos as youd like
it can be extremely frustrating to attempt a combo with the camera being so bad
there is just no way to predict how it will end up for youagain the word average comes up this time in the ai
your squad is all right as the  characters that are on the screen that you are not playing will quickly aid you when you begin to attack an enemy
the enemy ai
can fluctuate and at times you can sneak unnoticed through halls where enemies are clearly supposed to attack youthe missions you have to complete in the game are extremely boring and present little to no challenge on easy or medium settings which is all you get until you beat the game
the enemies usually arent intelligent enough to chase you beyond a certain point so you can just lay low for a while and attack over and over again for very easy kills
besides this the game tries to come across as clever with random puzzles it throws in here and there
give me a break
the puzzles are laughable at the very bestrpg elements 
it can be very fun trying out new characters and there are just so many characters that the rpg elements of the game really stand out
besides just getting new characters to experiment with you can add new combos to all the characters and this can be a blast to just play around with
when your superhero reaches a new level by just kicking as much tail as possible you can assign new points for them at designated access points
not only can you level up individual players you can level up your team as well
as taken from the games manualwhen your team defeats enemies rescues civilizations and just generally saves the day it will increase your teams reputation and you will be given special bonuses
multiplayer 
this is where the game really shines
not only can you play offline with a buddy you can also play coop over xbox live
you and up to four friends can all control one character out of your team
this is just a blast to play with your friends online and offline
playing on xbox live with strangers can be stagnant at best but still you can play the entire game through and through with up to  people
there is also an arcade mode where you and your friends will compete to try and get the most kills and things of that effecti cant remember the last time i had this much fun playing a coop game if you are the type that has been waiting for a good one to come out you are in luck
this is as good as it gets in terms of a coop playstory 
i absolutely hated the story
it truly is the corniest story you will ever play in your entire life
the plot centers around you and your newly formed team of superheroes trying to save the world from dr doom
oh the suspense
then again like i said earlier i am not much of a comic book person and that has a lot to do with how much someone will like the story
i usually go much more indepth in the story with my reviews but i really cant bring myself to talk about the story in this game
if you arent a comic book person and you are over the age of  you wont get much if any enjoyment out of the story
the voice acting is very corny the soundtrack is corny and overall the story just gives you no incentive to want to finish the gamethis game is just not very fun to play alone
the story is godawful the game play is lacking and even though the rpg elements are decent enough that alone cant carry a game
however when you and your friends get together or you and a stranger on xbox live play together the game can be a blast
so if you are not a fan of the old marvel superheroes do not by this game
if you are then this might be something to look into further but based on what ive seen from ultimate alliance i can give it no higher than a ive played all of the xmen legend games and loved those
but for some reason i cannot get into this one
ive tried playing it about  times and get about  mins
into it and get so bored i have to turn it off
that and i had a buddy that bought this for ps and i even tried playing it with him and we played for about  mins
and he said the same thing
i read all the reviews before i bought it and was really pumped up about it and was sadly disapointed
not enough fighting for my liking
i really dont see what everyone else sees in this game
i really wanted to like this game because im a big marvel fan
thankfully i bought this for  in the bargain bin
not worth the timethere are definitely more definitive s tracks than what is on guitar hero s trust me
the audio seems wierd and its difficult to hear the singers
venues are not new just reused
they had so much material to work with yet give us so little for   i dont see how they can sum up the s in  songs in the first place
it seems they are taking the fans for granted on this oneafter guitar hero revolutionized the video game industry and guitar hero ii made it even better an s edition should have been a blastthe first clue is that the game wasnt labeled guitar hero iii  it was encore
okay so its like an expansion pack
but its still full price
still i gave it a whirlas is the case with the previous two installments the songs are all covers
some are s icons and done really well  burning for you radar love turning japanese
but many are done poorly  as a classic metal fan i was sorely disappointed with the iron maiden classic wrathchild being in a word terribleremember all that extra stuff you could buy in gh
yeah its not here
i played the game on medium and unlocked almost everything  grim ripper and a few guitars
theres no extra songs or costumesbasically this is a gh expansion pack marketed as a standalone game
theres enough here to keep you occupied for an afternoon but then its back on the shelf while you play any other version of guitar hero because rock the s has so little to offer
unless you really like the s or just need to complete the guitar hero collection pass this abortive effort overthis is the worst gh game i have played
i thought it would be good because it was the s and i like some s music so i got it
it had about what not even twenty songs and i only heard of ten of them and i only liked about four
the graphics r the same as ghs and the store is not worth being on there
the game only took me an hour and a half to beat on hard and then there was nothing to do with it
i paid fifty dollars for this
if i returned it i would only get five bucks and then they would sell it back again for fifty
this is not a good game unless u like to pay fifty dollars for not even twenty songsguitar hero is a land mark for the musicrhythm genre of gaming
a controller that resembles a guitar a huge list of renown songs and terrific multiplayer
i own all the games guitar hero  and guitar hero  for the ps and  as you can easily tell i have a platonic love for this series
when i heard news of a forth i of course wanted to buy it
but lets just say im glad one of my friends decided to bring it over one day because guitar hero encore rocks the s is barely even worth being the th game in the series encore is basically everything one expects a guitar hero game to be lots of songs crazy looking characters and venues smooth controls and coop is still king
plus the redone intro and songs sport so much s vibe youll half expect cocaine to fly right out of your ps
but yet there isnt anything in this game that is better than the previous titlesfor one thing while playing this game i felt something i never felt when i was playing the other guitar hero games
i was bored
there are only  songs to play with no bonus tracks
compare that to gh s  songs and gh   songsthe number of characters has also been shrunken to  playable characters but when you unlock the grim ripper that number has been increased to 
compare that to gh s  characters and gh s  characters
all the characters are decked out in s outfits but your band still looks the same from gh  which is pretty lamethe venues are all exact copies from gh  just sported with crazy neon colors and other stereotypical things youd probably find in the s but they still look like the same thing from the previous game
they also took out the beloved stonehenge venue shrinking the number of venues
there are no new guitars and guitar finishes in this game all are from gh  even the unlockable guitarsthe songs are probably the only good thing about encore yet even they make the experience a little bogus
this is rock and metal from the s surprise surprise so basically most of it sounds the same
half of the songs are by onehitwonders that you barley know but that doesnt mean the music sucks
the songs are still as enjoyable as they ever were
but one thing is for sure
the final track play with me will kill you on expert but it sure is fun to play and it will make you want to watch that part in bill and teds excellent adventure where the historical figures are running ramped around the mall
coop is still fun to play because well its coop in a guitar hero game whats not to loveall in all guitar hero encore rocks the s could have been a lot better i mean much much better
this game was obviously made to put some quick cash in activisions and redoctanes pockets and not to make a rockin experience that everyone will love
fans basically waited a year for a game that took that about  andahalf months to make
the only thing thats new in this game is the songs while everything else is reused and downgraded
if youre a guitar hero veteran and have the other games for your ps and really want to play this game rent it hands down
for new comers just play the first one
guitar hero encore rocks the s just isnt that radical and not worth what could have been an amazing game now just appears to be a filler while they perfect guitar hero iiidespite the poor play list check it out even hard core s fans dont even recognize half the songs this game could have been worth the money if it would have had the content of other guitar hero games but it didnt
it only had a portion of the characters from guitar hero ii no unlockable songs and only one unlockable character
the lack of unlockable songs is a huge dissappointment as it leaves you paying the same price of guitar hero ii game only but only having half the content
also with only one character to unlock and no songs there is no motivation to strive to get the five stars on every songplay the demo before you do anything youll regret such as buying this garbage gamegreat to look at but if cars really drove anything like in dirt anywhere within  feet of a road would be unsafealso this game doesnt make use of the mouse which is disrespectful to pc gamers and flat out annoying you dont have the option to enable it
if anyones interested in the performance i get an awesome frame rate with everything maxed a  x  resolution while running on an ts
the beautiful graphics make me long for a good racing game which this is anything but
edit playing with a keyboard is next impossible and i find the game barely even has the keyboard in mind its vastly improved but still not that great when played with a  controlleri just installed it and tried it out
seems like a glorified crash em up derby
sounds really are terrible and the graphics stink too
controls are like pushing a baby buggy with flat tires around a mudhole and the menu system what the heck is that about
only keyboard control and no other controls built in for game controllers or wheels
have to manually modify everything instead of just picking your controller
must have moved the design team into a closet to make this one
theres other games out there that do it so much better
i cant believe how poor this game is considering some of the other stuff that codemasters puts out
this must have been a fill in game while others were in development
it sure is not top of the line and not worth the money
im glad i got it at a really low price so i didnt loose much on the deali also dont like the security drivers as it already messed with my internet connection
windows xp is my firewall and it saw the games security as a threat and xp closed down my internet connection to protect against it
had to go get a tool to wipe that junk off my hdd and this is just after the last disaster with dvd security software
i hate it that these guys have to use this stuff and i also hate it that they dont have any concern if it screws up someones pc from itanother joke from codemastersill stick with nfs prostreet and dtm race driver  so far those are the only two keepers after about  racing games bucks for a massive hd is just wrong
you can get a brand new psp for the same money
bill gates is a nut jobim going to write this review knowing full well that ill probably get more than a few responses flaming me for my opinion
but i feel its important to provide feedback that perhaps will be read by the right peoplefirst and foremost i own a gb hdd that came with my xbox  that drive is starting to get full so i decided to go ahead and upgrade to the gb model
unbelievably a gb hdd from my xbox  costs  from amazon more if you decide to purchase the drive from a brick and mortar storeto compare i recently upgraded my pcs external hdd to a full tb western digital for 
i also upgraded my pss hdd to gb for so why then does microsoft see fit to charge  or more for their measly gb hddd
i suppose the answer is pretty apparent microsoft has a monopoly on the xbox  hdds
no other manufacturer offers a hard drive for the xbox  so microsoft can see fit to charge whatever they want
its really nothing more than corporate greed on a company well versed in the practicethanks but no thanks microsoftthe only saving graces for this and other m xbox  storage options are it lets you save xbox live marketplace content and game saves if you plan on buying movies or television shows from xbox live youll need this device to store the movies and television shows
the typical gb drive may store one seasons worth of standard definition tv shows at the very mostotherwise it really isnt worth the money considering how little storage you get for the price
it and other m branded storage products are the only solutions to save xbox live content and game saves
other options require either violating a warranty due to hacking the drive and storing its content onto your pc or having your xbox  banned from xbox live for tamperinghacking
for the same price you could get double triple or even quadruple the storage capacity via usbbased storage drives
other consoles such as the ps and wii allow you to use various other nonproprietary industrystandardsbased storage options such as usb drives and sd memory cards to store game saves and other downloadable content
no reason m cant do the sameif youre a diehard xbox live junkie that downloads a lot of demos movies xbox live arcade games perhaps might even dabble with the xna game creation feature etc then you already have this drive and accepted the fact that m has won and taken your money
if youre much more casual perhaps only storing game saves and a movie or two then buy the gb model and save yourself the money for nowupdate edited to better reflect the netflix option on xbxo live
its a streaming service and doesnt use the hard drive for storage
apologies for the mistakeno wireless no hd playeradd it all up and you will see that owning a  costs alot more than if you you just bought quality to begin with ps
supposedly the red circle of death is less common with these models but only time will tellah xbox  a good system in many ways
the online portion is great
by far it is the best online play of any console
the controller feels good in your hands and works well
the system has a lot of stuff other than just games you buy from the store
it has great games you can buy and download
you can either hook up an either net cable or buy a wireless adapter for  dollars
you can use xbox live gold which will cost about  for a year or you can use silver which is free
of course you need wireless internet for this to work
you can also buy and download movies and shows
now i think having my apple tv that it is stupid to download movies and shows on my   but for those of you who do not want to spend all that money for an apple tv
that is a great feature
then your not just paying for a game system your paying for a media system
i am not sure how much space the movies and shows take on your hard drive but you can always buy a new hard drive
the few games i have downloaded are really fun
you can use a credit card to download games or you can buy an xbox live card
the only one i ever saw was for  points and cost like  dollars
a lot of the games on this system can be bought for the ps or the wii
i have a wii but not a ps
the graphics are great though not as good as the tv makes them look
i have only played one game that came close to looking like tv made them look
i mean the only way you will get the full expierence is if you own a high def flat screen tv with surround sound
i dont have either of these
im not going to pay so much more for a tv in my bed room
the games still look pretty good without the high def thoughnow i know i have said a lot of good things about the system and im sure you thinking why the  out of 
well ill tell you why
i got my first xbox  from a whole sale place in   it had red rings and stopped working
i sent it to microsoft and sold it on amazon when it was fixed
so thats   then i got a new xbox  elite
in  it broke and i exchanged it at the store i bought it from
thats   that one broke a little while latter and i exchanged it for a new one
thats   just to make things short i just exchanged the one i had for another one
that is seven or eight
i exchanged one  weeks ago and it already broke
i only play the system for like  hours in a  week period
if i had not just bought lego indiana jones and my mother brought me ninja gaiden  i would have sold the new system and everything with it for  dollars
its not worth having to drive to the store and exchange it
the store is only  minutes away but i can not drive and gas is way to much to have to do such a stupid thing
microsoft obviously cant and didnt make a good quality system that would last
i still have my ps and ps
they both still work
hell i have an nes my uncle gave me and that still works
i will never buy another xbox  game
unless after i rent it its really supper fun and i really want to play
i was thinking about buying a ps today but i said forget it
i will keep my xbox   i have to pay like  dollars for a new warranty next month
that is the only reason i will do so
if you get the system i warn you
get the warranty because it will break and you will have to return it time and time again
i am going to write to the news and some game magazines about how bad and unreliable it is
shame on you microsofti bought two of these last year for my  they worked great but i didnt get the best battery life out of them
i had to recharge them between once a week and twice a week with moderate use
after  months of moderate to regular use the batteries failed
since then i switched to rechargeable aa batteries and they last quite a bit longer and it was about  for a set of batteries  aas and aaas and a charger
i would recommend going with a good set of rechargeable batteries over play and charge kitsi bought my play and charge kit when i first bought the system
it worked wonderfully the first few times
you plug it in when you are playing and it will slowly charge the battery
however after not playing for awhile when i went to charge up the battery it wouldnt charge anymore
the controller was definitely connected to the  as i could play the games while connectedhowever the battery light indicator on the controller would glow red to indicate it was charging for about five minutes
then it would turn green to signify that it charged the battery completely
i thought that perhaps it was charging despite the light not being red but that was not soi kept it plugged to the  while playing for a couple of hours and then tried playing wirelessly
 minutes later the controller diedultimately i think it is more of a problem with the batteries than the cord itself
i bought an extra battery to go with my white controller and it suffered the same problemsi seem to be one of the few that have had this problem and they are not too expensive but be warned that this problem does occuri bought this charge kit so i can avoid buying batteries for my xbox controller
it worked fine in the beginning but now it doesnt seem to hold a charge anymore
i dont what why
the only way that i can use it is if i keep it connected wired to my xbox
the cord is pretty long
oh well i guess its better than nothingthis battery pack worked great for about a year
now it doesnt retain any charge
i truly believe microsoft designs these battery packs to fail so people have to go out an buy a new one
its a shady business practice
i cant recommend this product to anyone because it is going to eventually fail on them
youre better off investing in good rechargeable batteriesi myself love rechargable items
its a lot more convenient that scrambling for batteries all the time
unfortunately like most rechargable items this battery pack begins to die after a couple months
while it was still charging and playable the juice went out in about a quarter of the time that the normal batteries do which is pretty pitiful
if you are desperatle for a rechargable controller get the pack but buyer bewarethe instruction booklet stinks way too little information and helpthe help screens in the game following a match are on the screen for a millisecondhow am i supposed to read itthe control for chipping is impossible
too light it goes an inchtoo hard it goes over the green and out of bounds
then when i try somewhere between the two extremes it erratically goes over or is shortway short
there is no consistency in chip shots
i shorten my back swingno change in the bad result
if i shorten the back swing and use less down forceno improvement
no combination seems to produce any result even somewhat consistenti get the feeling that the game program decides how well or how poorly you will do as you progress through the pga career mode
if they want you to do well all my chip shots are fine
but if i start doing too well and begin to move to the top of the golfersboom i get a  over par with chip shots and putts that are either too long or too short
sometimes i havent begun my swing and the game does the shotbadly of coursethe game concept is ok but the control one really has with the controller or any semblance of real life is awfuland how in the heck does one get rid of the annoying mannerisms before and after a shot
hunting through the many menus might produce how but i havent found it yeti think id rather play the real thing
this game is overprice and poorly designedoff the top yes i am a huge fan of the k series of football
that said i still own madden  for the xbox  i am new to the  and bought it mainly because k football was coming back with all pro football
while initially disappointed with the graphics in all pro k its game play is simply awesome
i then found a good price on madden  and it was better than expected and it gives me my nfl fixso i decided to buy into the hype and try madden  the result
i have already sold my copy
it is not worth the upgradeit plays mainly like it could be madden the graphics actually look worse to me
this is next gen
i admit k isnt up to next gen standards either but this doesnt really look good
the players almost move too fast and not very smoothlymadden  looks much better than this
watch the dline go into their stance
they walk up and simply go down so fast that it doesnt look natural
and dont get me started on the fumbles
ive even encountered brett farve tiptoeing back and back and back and back for a  yard loss and it was counted as a no gaini am not a madden hateri want it to be greatbut until they adopt the presentation and tightness of play as k can do it will always be subpar footballthe madden on the psp is better than the  for the second year in the row
its unbelieveable that precision passers throw  a game in  for  this game is not offense minded at all
randy moss lavereneus coles and even devin hester can be caught up in this game
its a dmn shame
this game looks great though but until madden relases its stranglehold on the nfl rights and have some competition these are going to be some lean years for eaexcellent graphics and rightfully so for the xbox  no framerate skipping or clippingrunning game is awesome moves and feels just like college ballsooo many modes to participate in its honestly a football lovers dream come truebut even with all of these modesi found myself bored with them for some odd reason
after one campus legend season as a running back at north carolina i became deathly bored going into my second seasonso i started a dynasty modewhich kept me interested for about  seasons drafting the rookies became wayyyyy toooo tedious and time consumingand i actually think i got carpel tunnel in my left hand from navigating through so many draft menus land after facing the sameee teaammss every season i got sick of thatthe interception glitches in this game are insaneee
iv seen replays where linebackers have unrealisticly driftedor gravitatedtowards a ball that was wayyy tooo highh or way too out of the way for them to be able to catch itbut somehow they pick it off
iv seen other replays where balls have gone through the hands of defenders and into the hands of recievers
and with one play i witnessed a ball that was going directly into the hands of my recieveronly to see that ball stop directly infront of my recievers hands and change direction and skim over the top of my fingers and gravitate into the hands of the defender behind himthis has got to be the worst interception glitch i have ever seen in my lifeits like the game is programmed to cheat youi found myself having the most fun with the tug of war modebut that wore off quickly as well
they really need to fix those interception problems over at ea some of those same problems are in madden  i mean this is physics if you have a human handand an object is moving towards that handit can not go through the hand l i mean thats just not realistic
ill stick with nflk and all pro k on the sidewhich are both better football games than madden and ncaa
hopefully sega can take the franchise mode from k and put it in k next yearand blow ea
completely off of the face of the earth like they did in ill after the  version of this game i didnt bother to buy the  version choosing to give the franchise a year to fix the problems that made me hate the  version
sadly this version is worseone thing that i want to say first and foremost is that i dont like games that are too complicated
the recruiting mode on this game  while its got depth some players probably love  is too complicated for me
i liked it better in  when it was better than previous versions but didnt take up so much of my time and energyi played the first few games of this on the easiest level and after winning games by the score of  or more i moved up to the varsity level
things changed dramatically
my offensive line stopped blocking
every time i threw into coverage it was picked even in oneonone situations
my players started fumbling the ball
so as with all ea games i have to choose whether i want to win  or lose  theres no in between
in time i could probably learn to get better but i dont enjoy playing games with such a steep learning curveseveral other little things irritate me
you cant adjust the camera angle or if you can i havent figured it out
i dont like the camera zoomed in so close to the line  i like being able to see my receivers before getting my bell rung by the defense
in other versions you could move the camera up down forward back until you were happy
i have not figured out how to do this on this version so either it doesnt exist or im just not smart enough to find it which goes back to things being complicatedi like games that are fun to play and having to choose between winning big or losing big is not fun
so im going to take it back and just play the all pro football k i bought which so far is a lot more funits our fault really
we keep buying it
they keep getting rich off of it
so why changeyou would think after getting pummeled by gamers for the next generation madden  catastrophe ea would step up and score big with the  next gen football titles
nope
more of the same
nice pretty shiney graphics with terrible gameplay and no fun extrasno create a team
what is it with these next gen consoles where we cant get create a team
isnt this supposed to be more advanced technology
so why does the ps version still have it but the pss and s dont
no create a playbook either
oh but the graphics are prettyand yes as usual you have your typical ea computer controlled cheating ai
too many ints too many fumblesabsolutely void of any realistic gameplaybut i blame myself really
i bought it
we all bought it
so it will probably just get worse every year
because as long as they make their  they sure as hell wont care to fix itcant wait for madden  that should be a hootfirst offthere is no other game that i am this picky about
my madden gaming experience is important to me because there is no other game that dominates my free time like madden doesteam madden dropped the ball on this oneill be the first person asking for something new in the bells and whistles departmentbut dang
when the bells and whistles get so loud that you cant hear the fun stuff going on behind em you have a problem
the championship ring thing is just ridiculous
if i ever see someone sporting one of those things im calling em out in public for being a world class loser
seriously to think you actually accomplished something by playing a video game is one huge indicator for a serious need for counseling
i meani like video games too but get realmy beloved franchise mode is now so freaking involved that i hardly felt like bothering with it
why mess up a good thing with a bunch of extra crap that you now have to track
i dont know anyone that wants to waste hours just setting up a game unless theres some incredible gameplay involved afterwards
and thats just itthere isnt even ok gameplay once you hit the field
i know im not the only person that still feels like my players are iceskating down the sideline when i actually got a chance to break a long run or feels like theyre not really in control of their runningback inside
i just hit some buttons and prayyou dont set up cuts anymore on madden you just hope that things work out
thats lame easave your money people
if you dont have a backwards compatible psget one
then buy madden  for ps
youll get a more natural feel to the gameplay and thereby have a much more fun and satisfying gaming experiencepsdont get me started about how horrible the defensive side of the ball feels on this ripoff of a gamegameplay is pretty solid and fun but the countless bugs will drive you nuts save your money and wait till next yearea needs  or  generations to get it rightwas going to get their upcoming nba and fifa games but will hold off because i have a feeling that the frustration level will be very highi was greatly disappointed at the responsiveness of the wiimote on this one
your moves all seem a beat behind and many of the glitches should have been corrected prior to the release date
this is my first bad experience with the wii and most of it stems from madden just being a stale game overall with very few changes over the last six years or so
theres just no excitement or punch in this years version no hard hitting action and the online mode is an utter disaster
 stars for the roster updates but i cant recommend it unless youre desperate to see how nintendo handled madden
using the nunchuck to control your players may also be just enough to finally push you into that mental institution
i love nintendo but football may be best played on another system sorry folksi want to start by saying i am a huge fan of madden football and i love  for its fun mini games especially  on  which i played all the time
thus i was super excited for  with the addition of many more mini games cool elite players and ofcourse online playhowever it falls short bc the extra mini games you will play maybe once and you might quit in the middle of thosethey are pathetic and ea definitely went for quantity over quality  the graphics look worse
i know its a wii but comon
after playing mario striker this is patheic
i think this is due to the closer camera angle online play
if your lucky main controls have changed
turbo and dive have been switched around so that turbo is b button and dive is c button  this feels so unintuitive
the numchuck remote is used to move so it makes sense to have turbo on that remote as wellif you already have  i see no reason to buy this
all the features that have been added either dont work properly or have zero replay value
here is hoping for next yearthe online multiplayer is completely broken in madden  for the wii
you connect to ea nation and see other players but its practically impossible to connect to another player for a game
 out of  times you get a disconnect message im not even exaggerating
youll be ripping your hair out in frustration before you ever get to play someone online
mario strikers charged seems to connect fine almost every time so the blame really has to fall on ea for madden s online debacle
the online servers are eas and it seems like they invested in about  of them
considering the wii is now the best selling and most dominant nextgen console you woulda thought ea would have known better or treated nintendos user base with at least some respect
i bought madden  thinking the online multiplay is a big reason to grab it
instead its the biggest problem with the game ea shouldnt have even included this horrible nightmare of disconnection messages
isnt it practically false advertising to claim the game has an online mode when in fact that mode is utterly broken and you simply cant connect to anyone
thanks for the false advertising and frustration eathe first time i played this game i fell asleep it was so boring not joking
unlike many other people i have seen i thought ncaa  was one of the best games for ea sports in a long time first time ncaa was better than madden
a few things need improvement but i thought the flow of the game and interface was great
it was fun to play and realistic at the same time
ea sports totally revamped the game but for the worse
if you try to play dynasty mode it takes hours to get to the first game
although ea attempted to make the recruiting more realistic it takes forever to select players
it is also very difficult to navigate through the screens
then when you try to set your depth chart you typically want to start your best players but the order of the subs is not by rating as in the past
it takes forever to make substitutions
you no longer can quickly rotate through positions and players
you now have to use your r which pops up a menu to select position and then select the position but it takes a few seconds for the players to load in that position
although this may appear minor it took me over  minutes just to scroll through my players and select the best players to play
overall game play is not as user friendly as previously and the interface is confusing
not sure why ea sports felt they had to revamp a great game but i hope madden is not this badmuch like the ps this game is disappointing
i do not recommend this one at all or at least rent it firsti have been purchasing ncaa and madden since the first titles
i really hope that ea makes a turn around
i cannot believe that any gamer who tests this game for ea would actually like it
my recommendation for eafire the development team or at least the ones that thought this game was good enough to put on store shelves
they are ruining your gamesfrom an exea fanand that is the word of dcritiquethere are a lot of great things about this game but i am going to just focus on the things that are wrong
first of all every linebacker is ray lewis and can pick off a pass that comes within fingertip reach of them
that however is just a mere annoyance
the more glaring turnover issue is that someone failed to tell ea sports that the ground cant cause a fumble
time and time again your qb will get sacked more on that later and will tumble head over heals  times before losing the football while the guy who sacked him who is now  yards ahead of anyone on your team will scoop is up and take it to the house
i have seen this repeated multiple times in a single game and occurs probably  times per seasonmeanwhile the words pass playaction and blocking can not be used in the same sentence
even if you change your snap count which supposedly is supposed to make it hard for the dline to jump your snap it doesnt matter you will get sacked on playacion  of the time you do it before you even turn to be able to throw
meanwhile if you drop back to pass all you need to do on defense to stop a pass is blitz  guys and you will get to the quarterback with ease
blitzing is so effective its a wonder the snap doesnt get intercepted
meanwhile campus legend mode which is a great concept is still flawed
since you cant control anyone but your own character you get to watch while your running back takes the ball decides he cant gain yardage going forward so he turns around and runs backwards  yards then turns trying to find a hole but instead gets taken down  yards behind the losinjuries also happen at a rediculous rate
a hip pointer will not keep someone out for  weeks
neither will having the wind knocked out of you keep you out for a game
not only are the injuries rediculous but they happen with such frequency that it alone can ruin the game
in one game i lost  running backs  recievers a tight end a dtackle and my quarterbacka potentially great game that is ruined by poor executionnow i must admit first off that i have not played any of the previous dmc games
but if this game is any indication  i dont want toprosthe graphics and cinematics were pretty goodthe story was interesting and the voice acting id say was slightly above averageconsgameplay was pretty dull
combinations were a pain to execute and often didnt chain wellthe skill system was unsatisfying
its based on a purchasing system
you use a type of currency you collect from completing missions to buy more upgrades
however you can refund the upgrades you purchase and move your points around
essentially you have to choose what you want to specialize in
maybe its just me but i prefer becoming more awesome all around as i progress through a game and would rather not have to pick one thing im good at
or at least have enough points to spread the love around if you know what i meanthe boss fights were pretty simplistic
if i didnt figure out the trick to beating them right away then it only took a few attack cycles to pick out their openings
most bosses are only vulnerable at certain times so it mostly feels like a waiting gamethe environments are pretty dull and not interactive in the least
the maps are hard to read and not very helpful at alli played through once just to say i beat it and no other reason
i give it a  out of   and no i wont be playing dmc
pi think this game is made for the hardcore devil may cry fans
i havent played any of the other games
this one is a little bit hard to figure out at times what the objective is and it takes hours of grinding to learn any of the worthy abilities
by that time its not fun anymorethe graphics are great and the cutscenes are amazing to watch even if the dialog isnt very good
the gameplay is pretty dull and repetitive and those hidden levels are pretty tough to complete
the map needs serious work as its pretty easy to get disorientated
there is no replay value after beating it on hard
no epic boss fights eitheri dont like it dont buy this stupid game its alllies lies lies i say dont trust anyone to owcons  camera angles horrible
saving checkpoints horrible
character flow movement horrible
there is no substance or character to this game
its very dead
i gave up after playing for a few hours not fun at alli just finished dmc and cant say i loved it
the graphics are great but that is tarnished with so many screens being displayed with a fixed camera
the controls are solid and intuitive with all of the various combos being simple to pull off
also the difficulty settings are great
you can go masochisitc like dmc or you can make it a one button masher and play all the way throughthe main issues with dmc are story and reptitiveness
youve played these games and they have changed very little regardless of the character you are controlling
when i booted up dmc on ps for the first time i was blown away
the second stage after the tutorial starts out and there is immediate sense of deja vu not awe and excitement
i also have a problem with the story
unlike drakes fortune or heavenly sword the story didnt compel me to finish and since the game played identical to previous installments in the series i only finished just to justify the money i spent on it
not a good reason to play through a gamedmc has some positives just not enough to make it worth more than a rentalthis game its not bad i really tried to like it but it suffers the same fate as poochie the dog in the simpsons he was just too cool to extreme i mean xtreme
one for my taste i know that action heroes are supposed to be higher than the standard but after i just saw the intro of dante sitting in a chair and doing a flip while eating pizza i thought it was borderline ridiculous i bet he does a  while riding a skateboard when taking a pissthe game is not bad but the style itself didnt quite click the difficulty level is decent thoughbefore buying this game testdrive it first
i ended up playing this game after playing resident evil  and the only one before that was the original way back in the day so compared to re this was a sad disappointment
i luckily rented it just to test out the wii zapper on it and was surprised as many others were at the fact that you cant control your person
i was hoping that this was going to be a step up from the links crossbow training game which was amazingly fun and easy to use and perfect for the zapper including the portions of the game you actually control link
unfortunately reuc didnt even match up with its gameplay or graphicsthis one is like resident evil the darkside chronicles  you need to be young to play it and keep up
not free form like  resident evil which is way way betteri had never played the old resident evil games so if youre a die hard resident evil fan you will most likely disagree with my review
the only experience i had with resident evil was i saw the movies and i played resident evil  i bought this without even looking up reviews because i enjoyed resident evil  so much and i assumed they were all designed essentially the same
because of this i was vastly disappointed that umbrella chronicles is all in all an interactive movie
you can use the nunchuck to tilt the camera slightly to shoot people and you can pick stuff up but even when you pick up a plant for health you cant even go to a menu to use it
your character uses it on the spot
so if youre dying during a boss fight youll just die or else hope you have a health spray and theres that nifty little knife that makes you feel like youre doing something a little more interesting
i even found the fact that your handgun has unlimited ammo to be boring
the excitement comes when theres a boss and you get to push buttons or shake the remote every once in a while in between shooting
i felt like i was playing one of those old duck hunting games except with zombies
i was even disappointed with the audio
not only are the characters voices incredibly annoying is it just me or does rebecca chambers sound like shes 
but the music doesnt really fit
the music feels very light for a survival horror game and it really doesnt engage you or make you feel the gameoverall i felt that this game was designed for nights where you cant sleep but dont have the brain power to do anything else
its a game that a child could play if it werent for the gore
if i could do it over again i would have bought a different game
my only condolence is that i bought it used and only paid  for it instead of the listed price of the time crisis series has been an arcade and playstation hit for years
with the evolution of the guncon we now have a ps version
now some of you may be wondering is an  game worth the price
for me its a resounding no
of course on the outside this game has quite a bit of potential
two versions of the game and even some mini games to keep you busy
it sounds like quite the deal but sadly isntsetting up this game is not easy either
when you open the large box you get the new gun con  with an  foot usb cord
the game also comes with two infared devices that go above the tv
these also connect via usb
for those of you who have a  gig ps you have just used both your usb ports
setting up for calibration is not very easy and seems to be rather inaccuratethe biggest shining light for this game comes from the exciting arcade edition of time crisis which still looks good on the ps
the arcade edition is a lot of fun and feels exactly like the arcade game with all the action
point down and the gun reloads
simple controls for an overall good game
this was my first experience with this game and it was really quite an enjoymentthe major downfall of this game was the ps edition of time crisis that was made especially for the ps
unfortunately where this game lacks is in its complexity
what really hurts is the several functioning buttons on the guncon   when i say several buttons i mean as many as a normal ps controller
i couldnt make up my mind whether i was playing a first person shooter or a gun game
from the beginning you not only go thru the normal shooting but the movement
trying to get the calibration to work correctly was not very easy
i noticed several times that my shooting was off because of this
i was beginning to feel this would be done much better on the wii
having to worry about moving your character in every direction and shooting several enemies is no easy task
i played long enough to realize i didnt want to have to deal with remember the functions of a half dozen buttonsi have played several time crisis games and this one fails on being too complex
nothing felt natural about having to use a gun to move my character
in all this game had a lot of potential but tried to go way to far
if anything they would have made a simpler game for people who just want to shoot
i would not advise this to anyone unless they are a die hard time crisis fan and even then it would be ill advisedthis game was actually one of the things that tipped the scale and made me purchase a ps i already own an xbox 
i wish i could say it plays better than it doesgraphically it does not push the ps
in terms of gameplay if you have played this game at an arcade you know what to expectits pretty straightforward as to what this game isi am extremely disappointed in two things
first the complete mission mode has to be played with both hands as you try to move and shoot using the little toggle knobs on the gun controller
that is just plain awful
to say this part of the game is painful to play would be an understatement
and why the gun is not wireless i cant understandin arcade mode there are areas where pointing the gun to the left or the right of the screen is supposed to make you turn to fire at oncoming bad guys
out of seven or eight sessions i have only gotten that feature to work once
awfulthe best thing i can say about the game is the third mode called extra if memory serves and it may not
this is just a plain old aim and shoot area where you have to shoot targets of various colors and arrangements
to be honest this is the only reason i havent ebayed the game yetthat and the fact that i am waiting on someone to post a saved game with a hidden part of the extra mode unlockedthe gun is pretty accurate though
i am hoping that some other company comes out with a game that will really take advantage of the gun system
time crisis  does not do that in my opinionim going to fully explain why this title deserves what ive given it a  starfirst of all im not a fledgeling roller ive played and beaten the previous two katamari games on the playstation
and i have to say this one simply does not do them justicethe game gets a star for the menus and ease of play the game is directed in a different manner than most hardcore games while maintaining a nose to the grindstone type of play it also gets a star for replay value while not as high as previous katamaris if youre really into it you keep trying to beat your times and sizes
also this game has enourmous amounts of unlockables to find and outfit your cousins withnow is where ill explain why its lackingit loses a star because of its overall play
the  controller feels odd with the sticks so far apart and the ability to quick dash is harmed
that is a vital component to speedily beating the challenges
the game is also very very short only a few levels are brought to the  with loads of cousins and presents in each making the game get very repetitive as you must play the levels large amount of times before finding sometimes upwards of  unlockablesit loses a star for innovation
being the third in its series the game fails to innovate much the second game brought snoballs fireballs and even a sumo wrestler to the game for some odd but very challenging missions
this game focuses mainly on rolling stuff up its much faster too the katimari moves at a much faster clip and as such the timer is reduced making the game obscenely quick
you dont roll for long and you have to get to rediculous sizes quite often within a small time limit
the story in this also is quite underthought and has more of a boring quality
the other two were boring as well but in a way they kind of made up for it by making a bit of an inkling where the game was going or just providing a backstory like the second oneif i could id remove  stars for this in previous games the king of all cosmos would speak to you in game to say random things as wow or something to indictae the game was moving on
in addition hed make quick comments about cousins
his head shows up on the screen and he speaks rap sound text for a few seconds then goes away
in this game he commonly shows up and drones for sometimes a minute or two blocing your vision and speaking so much nonsense that while funny the first few times it becomes so irritating i found myself tellingloudly him to shut up
especially with the large amounts of presents and cousins over half of any given objective could have his head in the center of your screen
it wouldnt be so bad if he was in a corner or a ticker tape but hes dead center and takes up about  of the screen
thats a lot in a game and it really takes a lot from the experienceoverall the game felt unfinished and not complete namco didnt push the game to even attempt to be better than the previous one and mostly seemed to target fans for their hard earned money rather than giving them a good time
its a good rental but its not even worth owning the game can be completed in a few hours with little to no replay value
buy we love katamari for the ps insteadok so this game has decent graphics and the dogfight battles in the sky are pretty cool
the controls definitely take some getting used to
i took me awhile to get to the point where i wasnt flying in circles being unable to find the enemies
it can get fairly indepth relative to the choices in aircraft what to arm them with etc
as well as using your wingman to your advantage
there are some realistic aspects to the game in those regards
if i was only reviewing the game based on gameplay alone id probably give it  or perhaps even  stars
however i am reviewing the game as a whole
and as a whole it is mediocre as bestand that is being generous
how could a game receive a poor review when it looks good plays good and is a fairly realistic flight shooter
well ill tell you  the story and the voice acting
these things may be trivial to some but when i play a game i like it to have at least a passable story line and id prefer it if the voice actors didnt sound like idiots
from the opening scene it was obvious that this was going to be a weak point of the game
i mean seriously the game takes place in some fictional capital city that has some absurd name like capitalcityvilleburg
really
the makers of this game couldnt use a us city or state
they can use almost perfect f models sparing no detail but cant use a real onthemap location
and the enemies are invading capitalcityvilleburg from their homeland of evilcommunistbadguys township
can it be a little more lame
yes it can
the moment one of the forgettable characters opens their mouth
the voice acting is comparable to screeching fingernails on a chalkboard
and the guy who is apparently your commanding officer sounds like he blongs in a  coinoperated arcade game
i actually found myself embarrassed for playing it
terrible
simply terrible
if you are in love with the whole flight simulator idea and dont care much about the story or sounds then i guess you can check this out
but when you are  minutes into the game and you find yourself grimacing at the extremely lame voices and terrible intro dont say i didnt warn youpros decent graphics decent controls not a bad flight simulatorshootercons story was written by a  year old voice acting was performed by  year olds you will want to turn the volume down out of pure embarassment for having played this gamesave your moneybought this as  a gift for my nephewas a seasoned player it is so so with himcannot recommend for a serious player of video gamesjohnok ive never been much into flight simulator games and im only halfway done with ac but i just had write this review because of how terrible the story mode is for this gamethe planes are fun and look good the missions are fine and i have no problems with the overall game play but the story and voice acting in the cut scenes are so bad that i cant stand itits like the script was written by an adolescent monkey on a braille typewriter
the dialog is horrible from the first word thats spoken and is delivered by characters who have nothing to do with the actual gameit would be nice if the story actually followed the character that im supposed to be playing but instead it follows some lady looking for her kid some russian guy with a limp and basically anyone else who doesnt fly a fighter plane and isnt the main characterahhh
its just bad and every time someone talks in this game i just want to eject from my cockpit and let the bad guys winthis is john
say hi to john
john has never played a strategical rpg ever
he got luminous arc
he loved it
he played it again
he still liked it
hurray for johnunfortunately i am not john
i have played strategical rpgs before
i have replayed certain ones before and not just ffta which was yes a fabulous and in depth gamehowever this game has no depth
nor does it come up to the dss expectationsfirst of all the ds
a fabulous system
you probably have mariokart and thought wow these graphics are just as good as the n maybe better
these graphics are fat choppy and the battle animations look like the guy is doing the robot
it looks like a slash movement took  or  frames of animation
yes the portraits are pretty but thats it
it is not going up to the limits of the ds
even all the armor looks the same and as no color
when you have a different sword everything is still the same
its annoying really
also there are things called flash drives
using one is kind of like using a combo
even these are poorly animated and it looks like something off a gba
i remember riviera the promised land haveing better animation than the flash drives
one thing really shines in this game
voice acting
its fabulous
everyone has a different voice accents laughs everything
it really is a enjoyable cutscene experiencebesides the limitations its not a terrible game
the leveling system is pretty nice
you never know when youll get a new skill or what itll be
new skills are always fun and every one is actually useful
you get new characters like every game and they each have their one special weapon and skills
when your on the battle field you use the stylus to move your people and select options etc
you can change to the buttons but this is the only time where you use your stylus
its nice but also clunky
i calibrated my stylus fifty times but still nothing doingso basically it couldve been a slightly better gba game in the endprosgood leveling and skill systemvoice acting is spectacularwhen people die they dont go foreverstoryline is strongconsgraphics are bad not using the ds to its full powerbattles are kind of boringlinear
moves to fastno depth slightly dullmultiplayer is a laughmore like a gba game than a dsluminous arc is an extremely mediocre rpg
i would only suggest getting it if you havent played a strategical rpg or you dont own oneafter thoroughly playing through resident evil  and  i finally arrived to the overwhelmingly popular resident evil  ive read the positive reviews
i pumped myself up for all sorts of incredible mindboggling graphics and animations to excite me like never before and i can honestly say the previous resident evil games gave me a lot more satisfaction overallnow the graphics are truly memorable with every twist and turn your main character leon faces
it makes the older resident evil games show their age
throughout the game many of these twistedlooking mutants will walk up to you in an attempt to kill you
because the game is pretty easy and because the game is mainly focused on nonstop shooting action taking out the bad guys hardly ever becomes a problem
most of them will die in just one or two hits from the shotgun
theres almost no challenge at all here
you can argue that the same sort of gameplay takes place in resident evil  and  where a bunch of zombies slowly walk in your direction and you have to take them out one by one but many of those zombies require a fairly decent amount of ammo to completely killin resident evil  and  youd be shooting at a bunch of zombies and quite often it all became too much to handle and the zombies would eventually overpower you
nothing like that in this game because you can see them coming ahead of time
that really hurts the gameplayi hate how the dreary quiet and almost shockingly lifelike atmosphere of the previous resident evil games has been removed with capcom choosing to instead make a nonstop action shooter with loads and loads of bad guys frequently entering the picture
i admit that it looks pretty cool how you first see a shadow of a figure walking in your direction and then it appears right in front of you a few seconds later
i cant complain about the graphics because they really are a sight to behold
but i can complain about the lack of a creepy atmosphere
it would have made the game better in my opinionin resident evil  it seems like the game encourages onehit kills and honestly most shooting games ive played that had onehit kills only happened because of some cheat code i activated
in resident evil  it really is a simple game with leon only needing to waste a couple bullets for each of the mutants he facesi also really hate how theres hardly any freedem whatsoever to the areas you explore and walk through
theres one narrow path that you mindlessly follow for pretty much the entire game
it reminds me so much of the old playstation classic dino crisis  however back then walking down a small path wasnt considered much of a problem because the psx hardware was pretty limited in those days
with the playstation  and gamecube theres really no excuse for a crammy environment
improving technology was supposed to eliminate this problem
maybe they will fix it when resident evil  finally arrivesi also hate the little things such as the sound your shotgun makes when it fires
it has a weak quiet sound which isnt nearly as cool as the shotgun you found in resident evil   remember that gun
it made an exploding sound when fired
the death animations from the bad guys is pretty spectacular at first
however after about  minutes you begin to see them repeating the same death sequences over and over again and that makes the game lose its impressiveness
some of them stagger around before falling over dead while others spin around
it gets old quick
you can also aim for the face of a mutant and their head will explode
its not as cool as in resident evil  when their head actually blows to pieces thoughmost of the time the enemies dont make much noise after theyve been shot
theyre surprisingly quiet
they mostly make a quiet aw sound and then fall over dead
a far cry from the unsettling moaning sounds from the zombies in the previous re games on the playstationthrowing in a money feature was a bad idea too
you can find money in these white crates sitting on shelves in which you have to shoot to discover the money
also money can be found from enemies after youve killed them
money is used to buy better weapons from a merchant who occasionally appears on screen
now i ask you wouldnt it have been really awful had the previous resident evil games thrown this feature into the gameplay
the resident evil series is supposed to be about blowing apart undead zombies and making it out alive with the limited amount of bullets you are given
once you waste those bullets and cant find anymore lying around its safe to say you blew it you have to start the game over again
this is a good thing because it increases the challenge
now you can just buy whatever you want when the going gets tough
it just looks strange collecting money in a resident evil gamethe music is pretty unspectacular as well
i never once got the sense i was going to die because i was too busy mindlessly shooting my way through a narrow path and killing the same enemies time and time again in order to make my way to the next area and then blaze my way through that part of the game
repeat over and over again
the gameplay never changed
some of the bosses were awesome though
those boss fights were the high point to an otherwise overrated and challengefree gamethe wii version of the game is definitely the best with the new control system and the updated graphics enhancing the experience
i just wish that during the creation of this game capcom had focused more on atmosphere and the occasional shooting instead of seemingly neverending shooting
that way youd feel scared the entire way and youd appreciate shooting the bad guys when the moment finally came
so much action is involved in resident evil  that you really stop taking notice of the fact that killing something is supposed to be a special moment in a video game when the time to do so finally arrives
youll just be shooting your way through the game collecting money and upgrading weapons and repeating the same thing over and over again
resident evil  takes about  hours to complete and thats what youll be doing for the majority of the timehonestly the gameplay doesnt feel much different from medal of honor despite being a rd person shooter
i think weve finally arrived to a point when all actionshooters are starting to feel the same
when game companies update graphics the control system and gameplay theyre actually accidentally removing some of the supposed flaws that make games special in the first place
people might look at the graphics in resident evil  and complain about the muddy and grainy appearance but at least theres nothing else like it out there well besides resident evil i say skip resident evil  and just play the old games instead
the updated graphics and enemy animations are only interesting for a little while and then the experience wears off
ive actually stopped buying new video games for over six years because i began to notice a horrible trend in that all video games are starting to blend together and feel pretty much the same
after playing resident evil  i think theres some truth to that
graphics dont always equal longlasting funmy biggest complaint however is that the challenge increases by itself
this means theres no way to master the gameplay and mastering the gameplay is exactly why i play video games in the first place
you see depending on how well you do in one room will determine the challenge in the next room
so if you blaze through one hallway and dont get hit at all suddenly the next hallway will be loaded with hyperactive and exceptionally deadly bad guys that are not only more aggressive but your health bar will decrease even more upon every hit you receive
this happens the entire way through the game
death is now very likely to happen when youre caught offguard by numerous and welltimed cheap shots on the part of the enemy
why hasnt anyone realized this
 ive posted on resident evil  message boards and nobody believes me
they just assume im trashing the game and flaming the boards in an attempt to get a rise out of people
i dont think so
this is a joke an unfunny terrible joke
actually its a major gameplay flaw
i dont want the game to increase the challenge for me depending on my skills i want more aggressive enemies when i select a higher difficulty setting
if i were to choose a hyper or insane mode yeah this kind of thing would be totally appropriate
but not a normal run on normal mode
oh well some people dont care about this but its a really big deal to meits not just regular stage enemies either
bosses will suddenly make you pay hard and heavy when the game realizes how easy youre breezing through the rooms and hallways the quick commands will be even more demandingly quicker such as that dreaded knight room with ashley or during any boss fight that requires shaking the wii remote to avoid sudden danger
fail to shake the remote in time and you will experience a sudden and surprising deathlet me give you an example lets say youre almost dead and playing poorly when the time comes to shake the remote you will be given  seconds
however if youre blazing through the game without taking a single hit youre given half a second to shake the remote
dont shake it in time and guess what
death
unbelievable
this wouldnt be a serious problem if it wasnt for the fact that many times the boss fights themselves require shaking the wii remote which means if youre not fast enough to execute the shake all that work wearing down the boss will be gone in an instant and youll be dead meatany and all cheap ways that the game can take advantage of will be used against you depending on your performance in the previous room so the best advice
play like crap
take several hits
allow enemies to throw weapons at your face
allow them to grab you
heal often
shoot sloppily
shoot enemies once or twice and allow them to recover and attack you
pace yourself
running hard seems to encourage your enemies to run faster
does any of this seem fair
of course not
simply put the game punishes you for performing well
yes my friends this really is a twisted terrible joke
play resident evil  and  instead where absolutely none of this crap occursto be fair clearing out an entire room without taking any hits doesnt always create a sudden jump in difficulty
sometimes it takes  or  rooms of flawless or near flawless work for the challenge to magically go up
it always does eventually though always
ive played through re  times at least and studied the gameplay carefully so i know something is not rightnow in my opinion this isnt fair at all
it would only be fair if there was some kind of extremely hard or hyper difficulty setting and i was playing the game on that but im not
im playing the game on normal mode
i dont get itbut do not go over to any number of resident evil  message boards and explain this to people
nobody will believe you
plus youll get flamed
im not always a clueless idiot even if i might act like one sometimes
i know something is fishy about res gameplay
i just cant put my finger on the exact problem and whats causing this and if theres a way to stop it from happening because it completely ruins the fun for mesorry for shouting and i wish i had seen this comment before purchasing these two itmes re and perfect shot together
seperately they are both great
together they are worthless
the problem is you need three hands one to hold the gun and pull the trigger one to hold the nunchuck to controll direction and movement and one to press the a button that causes the gun to firethis was mentioned by a few other reviers
however their comments didnt show up at the top and who reads through hundreds of these things
i only hope this stays visible long enough for at least a few folks to see and understand the issuesre does look to be a good shooting game and ill start looking for a workable gun simulation
perfect shot is a great gun simulation and ill be happy when i find some games where i can use itfor me for now this combination is next to uselessbtw i feel that honest effective reviews can take the place of firsthand experiences that are lacking in online shopping
ive always appreciated the help ive received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as i can
i hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and ill do what i can to fix itthere is nothing wrong with this game
i think it would be great if i was an action gamer person but this game let me know im not
i dont know how to move and shot at the same time
i keep killing my character in the first few minutes of the game and i cant find the items that are supposed to help
the graphics are great the game is engaging
my problem is  user error
im sticking with mario karti like the wii and think its motion sensing controllers work great for some games
when i played this game on the wii however the controller and nunchuck did not seem right at all
i dont think the wiis controllers work well on first person shootersapparently according to the other reviews im the only one who almost hated this game
i rented this game for the sole reason that it got nothing but high praise
i played this game for ten minutes put it away and never looked backill say this for resident evil  in that every other aspect of it besides game play is just decent
the story line is just  well  okay
the graphics are top notch for the wii though
however its the game play that ruined this game for methe use of the wii remote is extremely clumsy and not very innovative either
you have to use your joystick on your numchuck in coordination with a button in combination with aiming with your wii remote in combination with another button just to aim and shoot
sounds simple right
not really when you have about  or  zombies storming you
you end up alot of times getting your view distorted when trying to fire at someone
your view of yourself gets in the way a lot of times and you end up seeing a persons legs when you cant see the rest of him because youre so worried about aiming and firing that you forget to hold your c button down just to look up instead of walking right into the person
i ran into this a lot
by the time you think youve got it down the screen comes up saying you are deadi will say this however to those of you who might actually take this review to heart
i never have liked the resident evil games in the past because i always thought the game play was always crap and always hard to use
i gave this game a try because the view and the way you move around and shoot are changed to fit more of a fps style
i thought it failed miserably in this aspect and felt that capcom could have done a much better job tweaking the controls in this game
also to me the game play is the most important aspect of the game
if i cant pick it up and play it without frustration within a short period of time then i dont like it
i dont care if the graphics and the effects are off the charts
if the game play stinks which it did in this game and the story line is bland like this game than im not going to like it
thats why i gave this game  stars
the only reason it got some stars was because of the good detail that went into this gamebottom line if you dont mind bad game play and a bland story line than i suppose this game is for youthis game stands for capcom going western and selling out by changing their formula
nowadays resident evil has lost its way and isnt resident evil anymore
i think this game is the start of it alland the sole reason that this series has died for me
bring back survival horror do away with this qte action zombie crapjust like in the case of the legend of zelda twilight princess a somewhat decent zelda title not a great game but definitely playable resident evil  suffered the same fate as it was ported onto the nintendo wii and had its controls butchered
playing this game on the nintendo gamecube youll notice one clear difference the flawless amazing controls have now been replaced by the atrocious wii mote and nunchuk controlsaiming the wii mote at the screen to shoot enemies didnt enhance the gameplay it made it needlessly more challenging and more annoying than it was in the gamecube version
luckily however unlike twilight princess you dont have to keep an onscreen fairy continually situated in the middle of the screen in order to maintain balance when moving but experiencing this game on the wii was a major disappointment regardless
i didnt like pointing the wii mote at the screen to shoot if you dont point it perfectly at your target itll miss them and its very easy to miss in this game
if you accidentally aim the gun too high too low too far to the left or too far to the right of the screen you have to struggle for a few seconds to get the laser pointing back to where you want it to be because theres a major lag when it gets stuck in one of the ends of the screen
same thing with the fairy in twilight princessanother annoying thing was having to slice with the knife and just like in the gamecube version its extremely delayed and goes in the exact same slicing motion over and over
youd think the wii version would have fixed this problem and made the slice go in the direction of your choosing but of course they fixed absolutely nothing and youd have to be as naive as i was to think they didthe worst part of all was the cutscenes which required you to move the wii mote nunchuk or press a button with perfect timing in order to survive
this task was challenging in the gamecube version and something they couldve fixed with this version but instead this was nearly impossible to pull off and i died way more often in this version than the other oneresident evil  is considered to be one of if not the best resident evil game and thats definitely true for the gamecube version but the wii version is awfulthe new minigames and new story for ada are so lame and stupid and repetitive
nothing new was added to this game from the gamecube version
all they did was put in some rehashed elements from the main story and changed them slightly for a new side quest starring ada
lame and not worth playingi was pretty disappointed in this game
i was lucky enough to buy it after the nd game had already come out so it only cost me a couple of bucks but it really is a pretty mediocre game
the graphics are awesome but all you really do is climb towers get in a couple of fights run and assassinate your primary target for that particular mission
you will keep doing these things on every single leveli was only able to do it until i reached the rd mission and realized that all that changes is the city you are in so i shut it off and stopped playing
i was also expecting puzzle type scenarios prince of persia style but found none
if you have no better alternative and you need to rent something i guess this is ok but definitely not something you need to buyits been a long time since ive been this annoyed with a game
i had originally played assassins creed  and was loving it so i stopped playing it in order to pick up assassins creed and get back history going in to the second one
i regret having done this now as the first ac is nothing like the ndokay here is a typical day in the life of ac
you take an impossibly long horse ride through the country where every single guard is chasing you
then you get to the city and you have to visit the bureau
from there you have to do at least  of  investigations  of  later
one is a pickpocket where you creep up on a guy and try sneak behind him without noticing pickpocket him before he randomly turns around
then you find another person and you interrogate him meaning beat him up till he talks and then kill him
or you can eavesdrop
once youve done this you go back to the bureau to obtain your target
proceed to target and find yourself in various situations to assassinate him
some are easy others are extremely hard and long such as the rich district in jerusalem where you are first surrounded by  guys then you have to go on a long chase only to be surrounded by like  more guards
assassinate then return to bureau
oh yeah the high alert is on the whole time as you now must sprint away from the assassination to get away only to find you are constantly running up walls running in to  people jumping crates and every other thing that can get in the way while a gang load of guards are chasing you
now repeat this eight more times the exact same thing with all the same frustrationsyou get extremely annoyed as you randomly run up walls or run in to people who just happen to swerve in to you only to find your target getting away
you go to attack and your sword gets put away or you run up a wall while guards are swinging at you
i couldnt help but yell and vow to stop playing this game
i now know why this game got such poor ratings especially compared to the second one which is so much more fun
in the second one you have fun exploring and climbing in the first you just want to get it over with and the exploring and climbing although a major attraction to the game becomes a hindrance
a major plus though is the lifelike feel of the climbing and running
it feels very fluid and consistent
as well the graphics are just amazing
i couldnt help at times as i stopped on a roof and just looked around the city although this could never be long because there is always a guard challenging you and chasing you if you dont move fast enough something else that is annoyingall in all i would say skip this one
it isnt worth it for adding anything to the story and ac is certainly way more fun and beautiful so why not skip the first one and start with ac
if it werent for the fluid climbing and running and the beautiful graphics this would have been a  star
as is i rate a  star because of that and the innovative new way to create a world
do yourself a favor and skip this one and go straight to the ac starsi have loved prince of persiasands of time games on ps and since this game looked similar and some people were speaking highly of it i decided to give it a shot
after finishing the game and unlocking  of the secret emails here is what i thought of itprosacrobatic abilities like in prince of persia games this is one of my favorite aspect of this game
climbing buildings jumping from roof to roof taking leap of faith etc
can be real funopen world i truly like open world games
between three major cities there are plenty of open world exploration you can do
my favorite part was to get on top of tall buildings and just admire the beauty of the well designed citiestools for assassination as the title of the game implies it is about assassinating targeted individual and to do so they give you some pretty good weapons
my favorites are hidden blades
loved taking down enemies with themstory have to say the game has somewhat confusing but never the less decent story
cant tell you much without spoiling itconsextremely redundant missions i was expecting they will challenge you with variety of assassination mission however most of them are exactly the same
unfortunate part is they are also very easy
so the first few assassinations were fun however after that i was bored to death killing the targets same way over and over again
and difficulty only increases slightly from initial missions to later missionsextremely redundant chores in order to get your mission  you have to do some chores
these chores are exactly the same in all cities
by the time you finish the game you will hate themannoying chores some chores involve annoying task like collecting the flags
hate it absolutely hate itlimited variety in weapons and upgrades they have few different weapons and upgrades for these weapons but i was expecting more
much morelimited variety in enemies there are very few different types of enemies in the game
again i was expecting a lot moreannoying chases so after you assassinate someone you get chased by the guards very understandable
if you get caught in public doing something stupid you get chased acceptable
initially all of these didnt bother me but as the game get more and more redundant these chases started to annoy me more and more
what was fun before became torture nowwater  instant death what the
you are master of so many different weapons and skills but you cant swim
this would not be a problem if some missions and assassination required travel over the waterto me cons easily outweighed the pros and what was supposed to be an enjoyable experience turned out to be a great punishment
so i regretted getting this gamenow while it falls the scope of this discussion assassins creed  is a completely different story and a great game
check out my review for it should you are interestedthis was the first game i bought for my ps a year ago after reading all the good reviews for it on gaming sites
man were they misleadingfor one thing the title is misleading
this is not a game about assassination at all
the main character is more like a medieval street fighter
stealth counts for practically nothing in this game and you are almost always reduced to fighting opponents face to face in broad daylight
not to mention the fighting is repetitive
you go through the game only using a couple types of weapons but even out of the four you get you only use the main sword really though the occasional throwing knife can help spice it up slightly
as for your swordplay you get to a point in the game where you are able to block and counterattack and this is the only possible move you should be using if you want to win a fight
if you do use the counterattack consistently you are guaranteed to win if not most fights you lose
pretty much all your fights are going to be using that one thing over and over
if you dont think you can beat someone you can go run and hide till they stop searching for you but most often it is quicker and easier just to kill your opponentsnext up is the missions also repetitive
you have only a handful of missiontypes no id say more like a few fingersfull to accomplish
and these missions are repeated over and over and over and over again
you start off in one part of the city and you go climb a tower
looking out over the vasteness of your area you find other missions
these would include saving a civilian who is being pestered by guards pickpocketing and your main mission which is usually and assassination but is more like hey lets walk up to this guy in broad daylight and start a fight with him
the missions merit you little reward
in the game reviews i thought saving a civilian was supposed to make people like you and help you out
all that means is some people bunch up together and if youre being chased you can hide inside them but even then that doesnt usually end up being useful since you can find many other better places to hidethis game has a vast playable area
you can ride around on a horse and search the many many nooks and crannies for little extra things like flags
but most of the map is uninhabited desolate and with nothing to do except ride to the area you need to go to or search for those stupid little extras of which there are so many you will bore of the hunt quicklythat said the city landscapes do look quite amazing sometimes breathtaking
the story seems interesting but after playing about  of the game i just couldnt bring myself to care enough to finish iti play a lot of games so i will be honest here the game is pretty fun at first
you do a lot of sneaking and death from above moves
however the story itself is too confusing for its own good and the game gets pretty repetitive
if you own a ps please save your money for a game like metal gear solid  which is totally worth itplaying assassins creed is like hanging out with a caricature of a ditzy high school cheerleader
on one hand it is a very very pretty game
its a pleasure to look at every detail obviously painstakingly done by skilled professionals
its also very slow
now im used to a methodical pace
ive played some oldschool rpgs ive earned the inchworm emblem in metal gear solid  i was forged in the slowburning fires of silent hill splinter cell and the first few levels of tetris
but in those games it makes sense that you have to go slow because youre either average obviously not supposed to be there or just starting the game
i understand
but apparently back in the olden days running near a guard was a capitol offense
thats not an exaggeration to be funny
if you run no if you power walk too much and a guard sees you theyll hunt you down and try to kill you with the same enthusiasm as if youd just killed a bunch of their comrades
altairs costume is supposed to make him look like a monk right
thats how he can blend in with crowds of them
so why does every guard instantly know hes an assassin just because hes moving quickly
even monks have to run at some point
and if it makes him stick out why is he wearing itso the only alternatives are to either fight forever or blend in with the crowds
it sounds cool on paper or on a forum but its mostly just walking real slow
it takes a really long time to get anywhere and even for someone used to creeping along slowly i just dont have the patience
even riding the horse it still takes longer than it needs to just to go to the next mission
and if for some reason youre not riding the horse clear your calendar you just got booked for the rest of the day
plus along the way there are checkpoints and if its your first time playing you wont see them coming which means youre racing into a trap
once youre out of the crowd and sneaking up on guards in the traditional sense its not bad but by then youre so used to using other people that youre not sure how to do stealth without themanother thing i hate is how on your first mission you have all these weapons and stuff and then after you fail you lose them
its a pretty flimsy way to make you earn them but then why let us have them to begin with
to tease us
incentive
its also pretty strict of this guild of assassins that their best guy gets demoted to trainee status just because they didnt succeed once
i understand they take assassinations very seriously and it does turn out very badly but hes supposedly the best and you cant help but fail
it would be like if you were playing final fantasy at lvl
 and having to go back to lvl  because a monster ran away
you cant help that why be punished for it
id hate to see what they do to the guys who botch their first missionthe assassin plot is basic but sufficient
but theres a different story going on parallel to it in which the assassins descendant has been brought into a lab to dream about being his ancestor so they can unlock genetic memories of him
this subplot adds nothing and takes away a lot
most of it is just looking up at two people talking for a while then shambling to a bed like a zombie waiting and then doing it again in reverse
it could easily be cut
this game would be better without these parts and the story would function just as well if not better
its not even interesting
ill sit through a subplot if its good but if its not dont bother me with itshould you buy it
i think this is the first review in which i could answer that with a definite no
again its like being with a stereotypical airheaded cheerleader
theyre both enjoyable to look at and if you work hard enough at it you might trick them into being fun for a minute
but mostly theyre just slow uninteresting not really saying anything and they make you wonder why all your friends recommended them so highly
youre better off with a hitman game
even tenchu  on ps is more fun
yeah its pretty basic and ugly but you wont spend an afternoon on one damn mission doing basically nothing for most of it
plus you can make your own missions and even the mission editor on a ps game is more fun than this gamei was not impressed with this game when i played it and now im replaying it because i bought revelations and walmart and got this game
so here is why this game is not that great too big for its own good  half of the game time you will spend is traveling to extremely far away places
the game wants you to walk buy enemies but that takes up far too much time and is just plain boring
i know its assassins creed but it is far too repetitive
go here and kill this guy
travel for  minutes and stab that guy in the exact same way
the start of the game was bad  they give you all of his moves at the start of the game then they take them away and you have to get them back just not a good idea
i didnt like altairs character in this one
if you play the other games youll see why the characters just do not matchupi have been awaiting this games release for years now and all i have to say is cool game but not worth more than a rental
this game was pretty cool the first time through except extremely repeditive
i wont ruin it but there are basicly  long stages to the game where you do the exact same thing in  different cities  different times with possibly the worst ending to any video game i have ever played and im  and have been buttonmashin since about  yrs old thats a lot of games
oh and if you like playing your current collection of many online and expansive games more than just one sitdown dont buy this
i guarantee your of this game will sit somewhere collecting dust for the rest of your life once youve beaten it and seen the horribly retarded ending
i would recommend renting this game though that is the only reason it makes above a  starthe first  hours of gameplay are great jumping from building to building riding a horse through open fields hiding from soldiers etc
then you realize the major flaw of the game repetition
you do the exact same thing city after city after city which gets old really quick
it actually becomes very tedious towards the end making it feel more like a chore then a game
im guessing most high reviews for this game were written by people after only a few hours of playingi doubt they would leave the same reviews now
its obvious this title was rushed because it was a launch title for the ps
the developers spent more time on the visuals then they did the actual content of the game
i recommend renting this game for a week not buying itubisoft sold us smoke this game is not what it was supposed to be not even close lately ive been wondering what is ubisofts problem with so many bad games if not all for the ps take haze for example and not developing splinter cell for ps among other examplesback to the assassins creed by the time it was released had amazing graphics not anymore comparing it with drakes fortune or gta the missions are repetitive and doesnt get any harderthe worst is that the game is very short one week and its done
the whole game could had been one long chapter of other gamethe best thing is the history but could had been betteroverall rating  out of uncharted drakes fortune is a much better game not to mention gta  or mgs after a few hours i was bored to death of doing the same thing again and again
the graphics and sound are nice
but every location pretty much looks the same
ive put in maybe  or so hours and find nothing to draw me back to the game
perhaps more different looking locales would have helped
more varied missions perhaps some underground sewer missionsso if youre a picky gamer which few people are
save your 
ive been gaming since  and find most stuff very unoriginal uninspired or just plain boring like thisfascinatingthe first half a dozen timesthen it tends to get a bit on the boring sideseriously when i first started playing i was very impressed
it was a fun game  hardly the original masterpiece it was heralded to be but fun all the same and this from someone who rarely plays rd person games
the main character was an absolute jerk and his voice acting was less than stellar but the gameplay made up for it
i mean whats cooler than running up buildings jumping off roofs performing the leap of faith and in between delivering permanent justice to some baddiesapparently the game makers thought nothing because they have you do it again and again and again and again and again and again
by time the towns and targets all end up seeming the same and you cant wait until the darn things ends so you can find out what happens id say thats too much of a good thing ubisoft thought differently apparently because it kept going long after you reached that pointthrow in a cheesy conspiracy the evil templars conspiring to harness mankind and a terrible ending and it seems that even your elation that the game has finally ended isnt enough to make up for the sense of time wasted
and yeti still bought assassins creed iithe repetitiveness and storyline along with poor character development and bad voice acting cost this game more stars in my estimation
up until things started getting absurdly repetitive i would have rated this a 
however if you go into the game realizing its flaws  and put it down for a few days or a week by time it starts getting annoying  youll probably have a more favorable opinion than i do
and as i said before with all of these flaws i still bought assassins creed ii yes i got a great deal on it but thats beside the point p the gameplay is very fun for awhile and after my initial disappointment i decided to give part ii a shot with what i had learned from the first part in mind
all in all this is a  that if you rent it or can get it for a decent price is worth playing at least for the first handful of missionsso i finally got around to playing and beating assassins creed
i kept putting it off time and again because i had been warned that the game was overrated and extremely repetitive by some friends
to a large extent they were spoton correct
had i written a review for assassins creed in the first  or  hours that i played it i wouldve given the game stars
now after beating the game im genuinely glad its over and feel that at best its a star gamefirst the plot of ac isnt at all what i was expecting
the game is actually set in the near future not during the crusades
although youll be spending most of your time in the year  confused
yep well the story will start to make more sense as you play along
suffice to say that a shadowy group in the year  has kidnapped desmond  your character  and holding him hostage
desmond is then forced to use a machine called the animus to relive memories of his assassin ancestors that are somehow imprinted on his dna
its far fetched but interestingyour enter your first memory as altair  an arrogant and reckless assassin  on a mission to recover an artifact from the crusaders
the first mission goes terribly wrong and altair is to blame
the leader of the assassins al mualim strips altair of his rank and prestige and sets altair about regaining his lost honor
al mualim gives altair the task of killing  individuals in order to set things right
with that youre released to explore the world around you and kill your first mark in damascusthe world consists of  cities  maysaf damascus jerusalem and acre
maysaf serves as the assassins hub and the other  cities are where youll find your marks
each city consists of  zones  wealthy middle class and poor districts
at first only one zone in each city is available as the story progresses more zones open upthis is where the first problems really creep in
as soon as you arrive in damascus to find your first mark youll be locked into a very rigid mission structure
regardless of how open the game claims to be it is actually the exact opposite
you first arrive outside the city gates sneak into the city via some scholarly assistance and find yourself again confined to whatever zone youre in
the next task is to find a tower to climb in order to sync your map
essentially you climb towers to reveal the locations of important storyrelated activitieseach zone has a predetermined amount of towers to climb
that reveals citizens who need assistance from thugs eavesdropping events pickpocketing locations and other assassins that either need help or are testing you
at first this seems rather rewarding and somewhat addicting
saving citizens from thugs garners you support of mobs that you can use to avoid city guards
eavesdropping on certain conversations grants you a key piece of information about your target
so an and so forth
the objective is to reveal as much of the map as possible collect pertinent information on your mark and report back to the local assassins office to prepare for the assassinationwhile this is initially rewarding the fact that you have to repeat the exact same actions again and again   times total by games end  will leave you groaning in boredom and tediousness
after dutifully climbing each tower saving each citizen and completing every other tedious task set forth for about  marks id had enough
youll quickly realize that most if not all of the tasks arent essential to complete the mission
you can completely ignore the citizens in peril find  pickpocketing or eavesdropping events which garner you the required  key pieces of information and then simply report to the assassins office in whatever city youre visiting
then its just a matter of tracking down your mark killing him and then losing your pursuers
its really that simple
though by games end youll likely be numb from the tediumcombat too starts out interestingly enough but soon becomes all to repetitive
altair gains more abilities and improved weapons as the game goes on
at some point you gain the ability to counter enemy attacks and this is where the game really becomes simple
in essence just tapping a button at the correct moment is all you need in order to defeat every enemy in the gamethe scale and the graphics of assassins creed are clearly the standout
i played through the game a full year after it was released and it is still impressive
the cities are genuinely beautifully rendered although the luster will most certainly fade once you realize just how similar each city really isassassins creed is definitely worth playing
though i cant honestly recommend anyone purchase the game
without the useless fetch quests whats left can easily be completed in a few hours
stick with a rentalokay the game itself was fun for the  hours that i played it
after sometime i realized where are my trophies
then i found out there are not trophies for assassins creed
i know
it seems a little harsh to give a game bad rating over a small issues like trophies but comon
i do play for trophies because it gives me a sence of accomplishment and lets other players know of my accomplishments
i understand that  years ago this stuff didnt exist its not  years ago
i cant play a game without trophies and for that assassins creed recieved a bad rating
now if youre a player who does not care much for the trophyachievement system then based off the  hours i actually played i would recommend this game
but if youre looking for trophies id look somewhere else obviouslyever since getting a playstation ive been waiting for a game with a largescale city with civilians that react to me and my presence i just didnt think id have to forfet gamepalya nd overal fun to get it
assasins creed does give me  gorgeous openended cities with all the skyscraping towers an acrobatic badass could ever want but besides that theres nothing
although i wanted a responsive city i was hoping for a little more than platoons of bareknuckle brawling lunitics and inyourface beggars that will constintly blow your cover in the same  recycled missionsthe only motive that compelled me to play was the historicalhitman storyline with a st century perspective that lines itself up right for the inevitable sequal
cutscenes are freemoving with alternating camera angle options that where an obivious nod to halflife  giving the protagonist altiar anikin skywalker characteristics made me feel like i was truly a medevil jedi
especialy in the countercombat animations which were totally sick even if the control scheme was a total button masherwhen you first start assassins creed you will like what you see
its a story in a story with great controls and some beautiful city landscapesthats the first hour of the game
after that you realize what the game is really like  a blond bombshell that should never have been passed out of the fifth grade
there is no central game and it becomes empty very quicklypros
looks great
controls are second nature anyone can be a master swordsman and almost put spider man to shame when climbing buildings
interesting layered storylinecons
no interaction
you cant enter a building and you sure wont remember the names of any of the characters after you finish a chapter
controls are too simple
want to climb a building
grab onto a ledge and just hold up
thats all there is to it
you will almost never fall from a building unless you hit the wrong button how boring
there is no real assassin play techniques
need to kill a target
simply walk up to them and use your hidden knife no one will be the wiser as long as you dont stand at the murder sceneeven better is once you master the counter technique for sword fighting you can take on huge groups of guards with very little chance of death
farther into the game you are required to dispatch entire groups of guards once again dispersing the entire assassination theme
also dont even try to assassinate the main bosses its a waste of time since the game always forces these huge group battlesthe icing on the cake is the fact that the story does very little to wrap up at the end and leaves you wondering what in the world is going onthe game looks and plays for everyone but there is no real assassination themes interactivity or closure
it gets repetitive after a few play sessions and id be surprised if even th of the people who buy this game actually try to finish all of itbut this game was a huge letdown
this game is wack with a capital w yeah its wack
it has great graphics and smooth animations but the overall fun factor isnt thereits like ubisoft spent all their time making it look good
running on beams and hopping from rooftop to rooftop was cool butwhat else is there really
the little other that there is is repeated over and over
i advise everyone to stay away
maybe theyll do something more with the sequel
they have some ideas here that should be expanded onthe first two hours of the game were the most painstakingly boring two hours of a video game that ive ever playedthe good firstgraphically the game is amazing and what really makes the game stand out is the immense amount of environmental interaction there is
you can casually push people aside who get in your way or you can roughly shove them
you can attack random people which will cause a panic and people react to what you do such as remarking about you if you go dashing by or calling you insane for bumping into walls or trying to climb up things or jump on top of random objects
bump into an armed guard and they will chase you
not only chase you but chase you relentlessly
its rather difficult to get them to stop as you have to get out of their sight and hide for a short time
your character is agile enough to jump from rooftops with ease hang on to edges scramble up walls like a cat and dive into stacks of hay to get out of sightthe many options for combat and running around are impressive as is the combat system when fighting people
it has some button mashing involved but its not mindless mashing
your sword can even get red from blood and horse riding is very realistic as wellthe badoh wow first gameplaywise the ai is simply retarded
about the only time the guards are competent is when theyre chasing you for causing havoc in the city
once they surround you or youre engaged in combat with them they only bother to attack you one at a time
so far in my gaming when engaging in fighting ive never fought or killed men who didnt surround me like a pack of gangbangers coming at me one at a time
even if i had no weapon but my fists they wouldnt bother and even if i were slaughtering them
it would seem the explanation being theyre too cocky to attack you all at once when youre helpless and theyre too scared to attack you all at once when youre dominating
no middle groundhistorically accurate it may claim to be it fails massively in even the most menial and yet telling of aspects the main character in a th century arab country has an american accent
you could nitpick with the whole well they didnt speak english in arab countries in the th century and it wouldnt matter a damn because english did exist at the time but america did not
not only is the american accent an annoying anachronism which is inexcusable because despite popular belief americans can accept protagonists with nonamerican accents but has the stereotypical arrogant american swagger so hated by people of other countries that not only makes him an unlikeable character but gets him in trouble in the game as within the first fifteen minutes of the game he already breaks all three rules of the assassins creed
because hes badassof course if you didnt know from the other reviews this is all just the memory being replayed via some scientifically fragile theory of genetic memory in which a persons life experiences are recorded in their dna and passed on through generations
the main character is yet another american stereotype of the typical badass loner assassin who just wants to turn his life around by being a bartender
not only is his dialogue so dull and listless as to make you not give a damn about him but he is also very plain and ugly
not really a valid complaint but its a physical manifestation of the persons mental stateso awful was this games story that i did not want to go on playing it after the first few missions
i simply could not tolerate it
i had to force myself into living the horrid story and aii was told to try this series of games
this one was very boring to me
i did beat it but i was just bored with the story
but it is needed to understand the back story i supposethe graphics were cool
as was the recreation of architecture of ancient middle east
but it the story is blah
and it gets pretty boring sneaking up behind people and killing them and climbing buildings and finding flags
repetitive gameplay and goofy storyline
dont believe the hype there are waaay better adventure games out there
i would skip this one
or play for an hour and be done with it because they game doesnt get any better after thatthis is one of the worst game i played
while the graphic is amazing the gameplay itself is annoying
when you play the game you can imagine the expanse of the world
however once you start playing the newness of it is gone
the tasks and objectives are so repetitive that i stopped playing after  hours
the objectives in each city is the same
climb up high pick pocketthat seals the deal
i wont even try to play the nd assassin creed
im actually quite dissapointed with ubisoft with thisi have loved prince of persiasands of time games on ps and since this game looked similar and some people were speaking highly of it i decided to give it a shot
after finishing the game and unlocking  of the secret emails here is what i thought of itprosacrobatic abilities like in prince of persia games this is one of my favorite aspect of this game
climbing buildings jumping from roof to roof taking leap of faith etc
can be real funopen world i truly like open world games
between three major cities there are plenty of open world exploration you can do
my favorite part was to get on top of tall buildings and just admire the beauty of the well designed citiestools for assassination as the title of the game implies it is about assassinating targeted individual and to do so they give you some pretty good weapons
my favorites are hidden blades
loved taking down enemies with themstory have to say the game has somewhat confusing but never the less decent story
cant tell you much without spoiling itconsextremely redundant missions i was expecting they will challenge you with variety of assassination mission however most of them are exactly the same
unfortunate part is they are also very easy
so the first few assassinations were fun however after that i was bored to death killing the targets same way over and over again
and difficulty only increases slightly from initial missions to later missionsextremely redundant chores in order to get your mission you have to do some chores
these chores are exactly the same in all cities
by the time you finish the game you will hate themannoying chores some chores involve annoying task like collecting the flags
hate it absolutely hate itlimited variety in weapons and upgrades they have few different weapons and upgrades for these weapons but i was expecting more
much morelimited variety in enemies there are very few different types of enemies in the game
again i was expecting a lot moreannoying chases so after you assassinate someone you get chased by the guards very understandable
if you get caught in public doing something stupid you get chased acceptable
initially all of these didnt bother me but as the game get more and more redundant these chases started to annoy me more and more
what was fun before became torture nowwater  instant death what the
you are master of so many different weapons and skills but you cant swim
this would not be a problem if some missions and assassination required travel over the waterto me cons easily outweighed the pros and what was supposed to be an enjoyable experience turned out to be a great punishment
so i regretted getting this gamenow while it falls the scope of this discussion assassins creed  is a completely different story and a great game
check out my review for it should you are interestedassassins creed is a thirdperson action adventure set in the middle east during the outset of the crusades
you play as altair a disgraced assassin attempting to restore his good name within his former guild
there is also a parallel presentday storyline that i wont get into here spoilers but it feels unnecessary and drags the game down somewhatbut that really drags the game down is the gameplay itself
first the camera alternates between hyperactive and totally fixed and in neither case is it doing you much good
i found myself constantly and i mean constantly correcting it with the right thumbstick
and just wait until youre in the middle of combat and the camera suddenly swings around and gets stuck in a tree  yes the camera can get stuck in environmental objects  or else is suddenly behind a flag
you get to enjoy the scenery while hearing yourself meet an ugly demisesecond the controls themselves are among the worst that ive ever encountered
ubisoft designed two parallel sets of control  one for gentle motions and another for more forceful ones
you obtain the forceful motions by holding the right trigger
however most of the game is spent using this set of motions so you basically hold down that trigger for  of the time that youre playing
hand and controller fatigue ensue
plus altair is clumsy to the point of ridiculous
much of the game is spent parkouring didnt know that that dated back to the twelfth century
around differnt locales but altair often fails to jump where you want him to or else slips off of an overhang to his death or else refuses to jump to safety as guards approach
again more frustration that the games storyline can justifystealth and combat should be the hallmarks of a game like this right
of course but both stumble here
stealth requires little more than moving slowly theres not much in the way of figuring out your environment shadows etc
in order to get around
just move slowly and dont physically run into any guards and youll be fine
of course doing so just prolongs the more boring transportation portions of the game
combat is basically a series of animations spliced together depending on your button mashing
it doesnt take long before you feel like youre just watching loops of cutscenes rather than participating in something dynamic
i call it dragons lair combat  press the right button at the right time you get a treat  otherwise you get the sharp end of the other guys swordubisoft took an interesting period of history and wasted their own opportunity with this frustrating buggy mess
i would say that its worth only a rental but the problem is that its also overly long and not in a good way  very repetitive in terms of missions
so youd never be able to finish by the time that it was due back
that said just avoid it altogetheri bought assassins creed the day it came out
i was excited to play another stealth action game that were fairly limited at the time
to put it simply i was very let down by assassins creed
it was incredibly easy due to the idiotic enemies that attacked you and died one by onewait for one to attack counter instant kill repeat
it was incredibly repetitive as well
every assassination boiled down to the same step by step formula every single time and the steps were boringsit on a bench for  minutes and listen to uninteresting info
seriously
i could only bear going through a few of these cycle before i just got bored to tears
thats not to say that the game didnt have anything going for it
the sound was great and the visuals were very well done
the world was pretty and big
and the story was unique
i just couldnt get past the ai and the repetitiveness
fortunately the developers listened to complaints similar to mine and made the necessary changes to release a fantastic sequelvery disappointing
its the same tedium time and again
the basic game play is boring enough but it never gets any more interesting and as the game progresses it simply throws in more beggars and guards who annoyingly trip up the tedious tasks so you end up repeating the same boring sequences again and againon the plus side its one of the most visually appealing games ive seenthis is a beautiful game indeed
i didnt mind the premise of genetic time tavel and you do spend most of your time in the crusades rather than the lab back home
the repetition of the missions is inexcusable
take a lesson from the splinter cell series also ubisoft and challenge us with stealth and assassination rather than having us simply wash rinse and repeat
not enough new abilities fighting techniques or strategy imparted after each missionthere is some openness to the environment but how many times can you rescue the same old ladyamazon asks how fun is the game
i say one staramazon asks how is the game overall i say two starswhyassassins creed was hyped so well that i ran out opening weekend to buy it
i knew nothing about the game the character or even the overall purpose
but game reviewing sites said  out of 
a musthave for nextgen console owners
once again these commentators have looked the other way in favor of advertising income and industrial  kissing
assassins creed is almost a  complete flopthe opening movies and even the game itself absolutely mesmerizes gamers with a lush gorgeous d environment
cities are packed with citizens moving about talking to each other and interacting with your character
the visuals give this game everything it needs to be a blockbuster movie
thus the overall two stars
however as a game it falls far short of the markgamespotcom said that there are tons of things to do in the cities of assassins creed
i found two things to do  rescue citizens and climb towers
both get real old real fast the latter only remaining interesting by the stunning views provided by sometimesdizzying heights
the core mission aspects of the game are deplorable  they require you to pickpocket notes from conspirators or sit on benches to eavesdrop on coversations
especially frustrating are missions where a fellow member of your creed asks you to make assassinations on his behalf because my leg hurts and by the way please hurry  i have to go to the market  sadly the game wouldnt let me assassinate that guythe game hypes that you can make assassinations from cover and immediately blend back into the crowd  your identity and crime never being known
this is true but only of random killings within the cities
the actual target assassinations are never allowed to go that smoothly
chaos inevitably assumes and youre left with a  minute run through town trying to lose your pursuers only to sit on a bench and watch them run by
if law enforcement had ever been this stupid wed have burned our own cities to the ground years agolastly the game requires you to sit through mindnumbingly boring narratives from other characters  both from the characters you are to assassinate and your leader who gives you your assignments
you have to sit through these every time whether you have to repeat a mission or go back in time to earn extra stats etc
there is no skip option
pair this with the requirement of collecting well over  flags scattered all about the map with absolutely no benefit whatsoever except to xbox  owners who can earn achievements from doing so and you end up with a game that is truely uninspired and flatout boringafter a few hours of gameplay i decided to wrap up the core missions of the game so as to earn the maximum xbox  achievements i could and then promptly returned the game to get the maximum tradein value i couldassassins creed is indeed a mustbuy especially if you really like games that are completely lacking in content completely without challenge yet persistently frustrating all wrapped up in a visual masterpiece with a pretty boxrent it
youll reap all of its benefits and be tire of it before blockbuster even wants it backi am shocked at all the great reviews for this game especially by the so called profesionals
it starts out quite interesting and the opening sequence is fun
the graphics are fantastic and you have free reign of an amazingly rendered world
but that is pretty much it
after about the first  minutes the game begins to repeat itself
how many times do i need to climb up and jump off a tower
the first time was cool the second ok and that was about enough of that
though there was something like  more to go
and the meat of the game is just as bad
sit over here listen in on a conversation kill someone run away repeat
after a couple of repeats i didnt need to play anymore to know that there is probobly knothing more to this game and if there is it is not worth finding out
in the end the dull repetitiveness of this game left me realizing i would have just about as much fun washing the dishes or doing any other menial chore and then at least i would get something accomplished
simply not worth the time
i chucked mine in the canyon i didnt even want to waist any more time reselling it
this may be a fine game for people who like or at least dont mind doing mind numbingly repetitive tasks but it is not remotely mentally stimulating
i would think people who play video games for a living would be a little more discriminating but it seems the folks at gamespot etc
are either on the take or slightly retartedthis game is graphically excellent and i love scaling along buildings and leaping from various objectsbut after about  hours this game gets extremely repetativemainly because you cant just locate your target and kill himyou have to do a bunch of pointless things first
youv got to scale about  buildings and reach the highest buildingthen locate an informant who knows who you must killbut they run you in circles and have you play useless pick pocket and interogation side queststhen there are street informants who have you kill more peopleand a bunch of other runaround and thats on every mission
half the time i didnt even kno where to go it was so unclearif they would have just let you know from the jump who you had to killand let you locate that individual on your own without all the  useless side missions like everyone thought this game would be i would have a higher tolerance for this game
but its definately worth the rentalor find it used at gamestop and return it within  days for a full refund
if your into games that take place around this time frame i highly suggest fable for xbox
i picked that game up when i took this back and i love itill i swear i dont see what people possibly like in this game
i bought it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews only to find out that everyone is so so wrong on this game
the fact of the matter is however that this game is about as exciting and fun as npr
this game is so so boring
it may very well be the first game ive never finished because i dread wanting to pop it in my system about as much as i dread dental surgery
but at least dental work is more fun and a lot less painfulthis game is simply a latherrinserepeat style of game
you play as a cocky th century assassin whos arrogance has gotten him demoted from the assassins union or whatever you want to call them
your goal is then to rework your way up the ranks of being the top assassin while killing all of your towns enemies off on the road and blending in with the townspeople being stealthy etc
all of this takes place within the flashbacks of a modernday bartender whos being held captive against his will by a scientist and his assistant whos using him for their research in genetic memories
the assassin you play as is a direct descendant of the guy and the scientists are viewing his ancestors memories through a high tech machine
and inbetween accessing the past there isnt much else you can dobasically you sneak into towns save countless townspeople from the same soldiers accusing them of theft and climb up hundreds of towers in order to expand your map you cant go any further without the semirealistic way of seeing your overall area by climbing up the top of high towers in order to see everything to expand your map
thats right you have to actually work just to see where youre going
doing all of these things maybe i dont know  or  times is okay but youll be doing these things literally dozens of times in any given area making the overall game very boring very repetitive and not fun whatsoever
each of the three towns you go to has a rich poor and middle class district and in any given district youll have to climb about  towers save about  citizens from persecution and interrogate or spy on about  people
and thats per district per town
so yeah
you can just imagine how boring this gets after a while
and doing the research on your enemy is about threequarters of the game play
the actual fightingkilling is the last thing you actually dothe sword fighting system is very archaic and simple
basically its button mashing and dodging until everyone is killed
while i admit the counters are cool the overall sword fights are just as repetitive and boring as anything else in the game
and when you finally get to face the enemy youre after even he is no different or unique from any other enemy youve facedthis game isnt good at anything they claim to boast
its not that good at being stealthy all you do is blend into the crowd which considering your wardrobe actually doesnt make any sense and its not that good at being fun seriously why all the climbing towers and saving people
and its not that good at doing much else of anything as far as game play is concerned
sure the game looks and sounds great but is about as fun as the worst college history class youve ever been in
the whole game itself draws a lot of knowledge and information and historical accuracy so i cant help but feel like this game was made by a bunch of history geeks who know nothing about what the term fun or entertaining is and that feeling seeps within every aspect of this game
its simply boring as hell and thats about as much as you need to knowdont make the mistake i did in buying this game
while it may be a bit egotistical to go against so many other people i just have to say that they simply just dont know what theyre talking about
or theyre entertained easily by the graphics and feel of the game because there is no aspect of fun game play whatsoever in this title
this game literally feels like a chore to play and i dont like taking a video game as a chore rather than as funill end on this dont play this godawful gameanyone in their right mind can see the assassins creed is one of the most graphically flawless xbox titles to date
complete with a beautiful sound score as well but ultimately very overhyped and boringclimbing jumping sneaking and stabbing
it just gets so dam repetitive and painfully boring after awhile
xplay actually said this first publicly before anyone did and they were rightpersonally i have officially lost interest as of last night
i could no longer bear the idea of having to revisit the same cities at the same snails paceeach mission sends you back to areas already combed and with little to no change in gameplay
i had two more missions to go before some mysterious secret was to be revealedsadly i just put down my controller and said i dont care anymore
this sucks now
many people love this game however if you read their reviews most are based simply on appearance alone
i was hesitant to play the orange box title when it came out because i hate overhyped crapi was never so wrong with a game as with that onewhat a masterpeice
feeling like i learned my lesson i figured i could very well be wrong in assuming assassins creed would be the same lesson taught
nope
so far if xplay says its one way or the other ill be inclined to pay more attention in the futurethis is an ok game
its difficult sometimes but i always try not to judge games based upon release hype
i have had a  for about a year and a half and usually buy all the major releases especially if they get positive reviews from users on sites like this i dont put much stock in professional reviewers or game magazines because they are usually beholden in some way to the publisherwith all that said this game is fair
the graphics are indeed very good
the control scheme is very different and takes some getting used to
once you get it down you can indeed scale big buildings jump across rooftoops and all that
but my two disappointments are why is this rated m
theres hardly any blood
i dislike any freeform game that frowns on killing innocents
i dont bother them all the time but i do like knowing i can if i want to be evil
i make this complaint in most of my reviews and im going to repeat it here and in a couple of new reviews im planning to writewith todays modern games all that technology advanced programming next gen blah blah yada yada yak yak why cant there be a quicksave
why do we have to be subjected to checkpoints and autosaves
it is frustrating as hell to get almost to the end of a level get killed and have to start again from the checkpoint miles or an hour back
stop itso except for the facts that its not freeform enough not gory enough and has no quicksave assasins creed is fair
i didnt see any glitches and dont mind the bruce lee movie style attacks eg
twelve guys attack you and each wait politely till you kill the guy youre fighting with before they attack because im not so good at combat and would get killed more
i would not recommend buying without renting firstthe game is boring i finished it and all and it does have an interesting story i mean like the one thats happening in the near future with desmond but every mission is exactly the same aaaall  of em over and over
id recommend you buy it only so you know that background story for the ac ii a much better gameim glad that i got this game later instead of buying it when it was repetitive and nothing great about itvery boring gameall of the others of this series are the samemore like assassins greedtldr finding flags repetitive frustrating missions and annoying side missionsmy first attempt at playing this game ended with me finishing the first missions and the game frozewould not continue no matter what i didnd attempt was a better attempt
i managed to play through until he th assassination
at which time i realized that i had done the same mission  times and the side missions  times which are required to advance in gamethe game is repetitive and can burn you out on the series your best bet is to just buy the nd game and start from therefirst off im going to say that i found this game to be strangely entertainingfor the bad this game has horrible graphics poor frame rate laughable voice actingno im serious there were times i was rolling on the floorvery poor story
the ending was horrible nomatter if you were evil or good
control was a pain
horse was the worst by far
and the game froze at least once every time i played it
the only game ive ever played on my  that froze
one of the selling points that they use for this game is the changing environments without loading ie
walking into buildings
what they dont tell you is that the game loads at extremely inopportune times
ie
in the middle of battles or there was this one small house that the game loaded  different times because i walked into different sections of the housethis game could have been one of the best rpg games to date if the creators had actually spent a little time with the engine and storynow for what i found entertaining
i liked how you could upgrade your weapons and armor by adding  of the same type together
you can get some fairly ultimate equipment by doing this
making potions was also fun
especially when you could make them that do permanant effects to your stats
my character had over  strengh by doing this
its not even a cheat
basically this games whole point seemed to be upgrading your character
i never played the game for the story or anything else
it kept me addicted and entertained by finding weapons and armor and there are very many and combining them to make better than i think the creators even intendedas for the online
its nothing
i went online several different times and never found anyoneif you like treasure hunt games this one is fairly good but thats alli waited and waited and waited some more for this game to arrive
after logging  plus hours with oblivion  games after that just didnt hold much appeal for me
so i had some very high hopes as did many of us  for two worldsfor all the release delays this game offered us its engine was a buggy mess
the graphics were very poor mostly they seemed to have a very jagged appearance reminiscent of olderlow polygon count games
many of the light effects were very obnoxious
flames looked very unrealistic light gradients were very miscolored
example  you would be walking through a otherwise dark cave when suddenly the passage is a light blue color
no blue flames indicating the presence of supernatural activity nothing
just blueshadows were very jagged looking as well
at times the shadows of a tree would make me wonder if i was interacting with some thing instead of a shadow
water was like a wobbly mirrorone of the most annoying and near laughable features in the game was the inability to control a horse
i soon discovered that wasting earned skill points points on my horse riding skills waswell a waist
if you had to stray from the beaten path what so ever your mighty stead was bound to get completely immobilized by a shrub or tree
slight embankments and hill sides were also a major nono for our stead
i cant imagine what the team involved in the actual design of the horse in two worlds was thinkingim thinking malt liquor and bonghits were the sole inspiration for this one
next was the now legendary horrific voice acting
the voice actors themselves sounded as if they had to perform nude in front of a stadium of giggling onlookers
very uncomfortable sounding
not only did the characters sound scared but there was simply not enough variety in the actual voices
you could speak to a close group of three people who all shared the exact same voice and greetingthe a i was very funny
very bad but at least it made you laugh
for instance  i could interact with a character who absolutely hated my character and made it known by cursing and threating me
however as soon as the interaction was over they would say in a totally different voice  grand day
or greetings tall one
or  a fine day indeedthe menu looked a lot like the old diablo menue system right down to the barely readable fonts
it wasnt until my wife and i bought a hd tv
that i could even read what some the menu items or instructions saidthe travel log was the worst i have ever seen
its crammed way over to the right side of the menu screen and written in tiny black letters with some words being separated by an entire line width
it was absolute torture to try and followthe title music was also the cheesiest music i have heard in a long long time
anyone here remember that old song called a total eclipse of the heart by bonnie tyler
it sounded like that but with some generic wannabe operatic woman singing
the ingame music was very unbalanced as well
it was either very quiet or very loud so adjusting it in the controls menu was pointless
not to mention most of the time the music itself when you could hear it didnt fit the situationnow there were believe it or not some redeeming qualities to the game
combining similar weapons to make a more powerful version was great
i had some massive sword called the dragons jawbone that had a slashing power of over   basically i had a one hit wonder
one hit and most everything went flying across the screen and laid on the ground twitching 
that was pretty satisfyingcreating you own spells and so forth could have been cooler if you had some sort of guide to help you
since you didnt it was more or less a way to make room in your inventory or power up magical attributes for a weapon
mostly it was just cumbersome
i beat the game without ever really using any magici threw a few fire balls but why bother when you can smash the tar out of anything with a giant jaw bone
lol  the bow was great to
once you got your skill level with the bow up to ten and its damage abilities really high you could wipe out an entire orc camp with it no problemsadly though the game just ends up being a decent way to relax before bed cracking orc skulls and flinging bandits into the weeds is always a joyfor  to  though its just not worth it
rent it borrow it or wait until its in the clearance bin
whatever you do though dont waste your money on a brand new copy and especially the collectors editiona prequel to assassins creed altairs chronicles explores the titular assassins life before the events detailed in assassins creed
it also makes the rather clumsy transition from the ps and xbox  to the nintendo dsthe story is much more simple in this game than in the original possibly because if the events of this game were particularly groundbreaking the events of the original would not make as much sense
altair is attempting to find the chalice  a powerful artifact said to be able to unite many groups under a single banner  by the order of his superiors
if the crusaders or saracens should find it they would use it to end the crusades and dominate the holy land
notably absent is the modern day setting present in assassins creed  showing the use of the animus machine to relive past events and so on though the main menu is meant to be the animus displaythe gameplay is meant to be similar to assassins creed but isnt quite as advanced
altair runs jumps and climbs like he does in the original though with slightly less grace
attacking has been reduced to attacking blocking and countering with a lot less of the subtlety that made it so fun in assassins creed
the top screen usually displays gameplay while the bottom screen holds a map showing where all the people in the area are
certain activities like interrogation and pickpocketing have been turned into touchscreen minigames
the former relies on a timed sequence of pointpressing to simulate pressure points while the latter involves dragging an item through a bag without touching the bags other contents
instead of the old system of getting upgrades after completing missions altair must now collect blue orbs  slightly out of place in the otherwise fairly realistic setting  to upgrade his health and weaponrythe graphics didnt survive the transition to the ds very well
the attempt at d is grainy and blocky with little of the detail shown in assassins creed
the level design is especially artificial contrasted with the occasionally improbable but still acceptable cities in the original
in altairs chronicles the buildings seem much less sensibly constructed with one village containing giant stone arches and pillars that seemed out of place amidst its otherwise lowlevel construction of course you have to follow the path up and across the pillars the continue
as a whole they seem fairly obviously like an attempt to compress cuttingedge graphics into a portable system see also the gba splinter cell games
the sound is similarly disappointing being barely noteworthy in any sense of the wordas a whole the game fails to live up to the original assassins creed
even on its own its not a very good game
despite an attempt to use the dual screen function it seems more like a gimmick than an actual gameplay point
this game just doesnt have anything that the original did everything from story to gameplay to technical things is eclipsed by the originalnot worth it
as i am not as big of a fan of consoles as i am portables i decided to buy this game at a local store
big mistake
it is not a portable version of the console game
the graphics are horrible and pixilated and it lags
plus the camera doesnt change angles so it is difficult to see where you are walking sometimes
altair dies super easy
while walking between a maze of spikes near the beginning of the game altairs foot touched the base of a spike and suddenly i got the death screen
so not worth the  i spent on itall aspects of this game i consider below average graphics physics dialogue soundtrack
using guns is just about useless and your teammates are not much help at all
the only thing they are good at is asking if youre all right after being killed
the cutscenes can be tedious and frustrating when you cant shortcut themtheres a part in a warehouse scene where every  ft you walk youre thrown into a cutscene so by the time you have gotten to the end of the walkway you spent  minutes in cutscenes  ridiculous
the only positive things i would have to say about this game is that if youre into stealth games its loaded with stealth tactics and the plot actually is not bad after you get towards the last quarter of the gameyeah this game really sucked no pun intended but i cant really name too many highlights
i know theres an argument saying its not a terrible game but this is definitely not nexgen material
i know thats becoming a new trend now people putting down games that they feel are not up to nextgen standards but this game really isnt
my roommate reserved this mainly cause the preview looked awesome long story short major disappointment
this would actually be a pretty cool title on the ps i think
the controls really dont fit right with the  controller and i think for the stealth games the ps controller has its advantages
ie
metal gear solid  the graphics look well polished but you can tell they didnt make any effort to place it with the rest of the current  titles
if youre still not convinced i can only urge that you rent before you splurgeboring repetitive gameplay
you fly circles around a dark space background shooting at other ships
i stopped playing after a half hourthis game is a mess though it was made many moons ago
the graphics are okay but you cant see a lot of the smaller enemies the weapon system is good the scale of battles is good howevereverything is poorly implemented especially the control schemecontrol is too touchy battles are too hectic and too fixed objectivewise story is goofy and the game is extremely repetitive
even with a six pack in front of you youre going to be bored out of your skull
it is a very cheap game at retail though in this case youre going to get what you pay forthis is like going back to civ iii
the combat system will have you pulling your hair out in much the same way as iii
the espionage system will quickly grow uninteresting
i just turn it off at this point
so heres the main problem
you basically need  odds in your favor to win a fight
 odds means a  chance you will lose
anything below  allegedly in your favor means you will likely come out on the short end
other irritants are things like enemy catapults and cavalry retreating with success nearly  of the time
heres how espionage works spys come in and blow up a mine
so you go fix it
you can blow up a mine and your opponent will go fix it too
they can poisong your wells or foment unrest
you can do the same
most of the time spies get caught in the late game and not much gets accomplished by way of secret agents
an espionage standstill develops
it doesnt add much
corporations do little other than give a small financial boost
you still cannot negotiate for trades with any real frequency let alone build a strategy around trading
a majority of the time your negotiation screen with any ai civ will show only a column of red text meaning they are not interested in trading anything
just go it alone
in conclusion this is no real improvement upon warlords
the fighting odds make no sensethere are points in favor of this game the new units are interesting new buildings also add a new layer to gameplay the new wonders are also abundant and give you a chance to at least grab a few of these key structures if you are struggling
if you are a civ fan you will buy this game regardless of its flaws
if you are on the fence just be aware that not all change is good
sometimes it can just be downright annoying
ive been playing civ for four years and typically look forward to each new civ product but this is a pretty big let downupdate so a year or so later i pop bts back in to play with the new patch
the patch just makes things worse
now ai can spawn as many units as it would like
in a war with another civ that had only three cities compared to my dozen or so i couldnt win because of the spawning
when my units show up to seige a city there were a few defenders waiting for me
next turn the city is suddenly full of defenders
they didnt come from other cities to defend because i could see all three of the enemy cities and the units therein
this kind of thing just makes the game boring
still enjoying the warlords expansion quite a bit and would recommend that over bts built to suckthis expansion pack simply doesnt bring enough new material to the table to warrant 
in fact i dont even like the new additions
i prefer to play civ iv gold edition which includes the warlords expansion more than beyond the swordi had a great time playing this console and video game system
the wireless controls are easy to use and if you have rechargeble batteries they last a few daysthe graphics are fantastic if the right games are played
gears of war dead space mass effect etc
and the sound is awesomeive gotten some great use out of this console and my experiences were all positive until a few days ago
ive used this system for just over  years and it finally brokeits called the red ring of death
i think every xbox will eventually get one that was manufactured in the last two yeras
i waited until after first launch and until they worked some bugs out to buy this system
and it just stopped workingi am very upset by this and very let down
as i have friends who bought a ps and are still enjoying it todayi did check the microsoft website and they are covering my repairs under warranty
but im out of an xbox for atleast a few weeks while it gets shipped to texas for repairsand im reading reviews of problems after thier consoles have been repaired
i am not happy with microsoft or the xbox right nowif i knew they would produce an expensive product that simply shorts out after  years of safe and moderate use i would have bought the sony ps insteadwhen i opened the package i realised that no audio and video cables were not  included which wasnt in the description and the charge cable does not work for the paddlecontroller so do not buy used items from this selleroh boy where do i start
this game was terrible i expected it to be alot better and which saying so i should have expected nothing out of this game and maybe i would have enjoyed this game more
the shooting was terrible and was definetly not your average combat game
the graphics were the worst part
just the entire gameplay in general was awful
this is game is a ok buy for the ps but dont expect very much from itok so first things first the overall review
it is a good game but is not worth the  dollars i paid
i would pay  dollars for it
it is surely not compareable with cod or prosonline is great
it is fun for sniping or just shotguns there are so many vehichle you can use which is very fun
there are  and  person vehicles
there is atvs buggies hummers armadilos different sorts of tanks and different sorts of helicopters and boats lots of different sorts of maps choice to be two different speciseach with it own perks and disadvantages
there is the strogg and the humans
for the strogg there is also lots of different futuristic guns and vehicles you can choose to be different classes like medics mechanics snipers field soldiers and others you can build stuff like anti personel turrets or build bridges across ditches for tanks to get bycons ai turn straight away and start shooting you even if you are  feet away you cant  customize guns cant switch controls around so there is always set controls not the great of graphics not as great as other gams like cod and if you like online first person shooters you should get this
there are many different sort of gameplayi bought this game on x box live games on demand which i would suggest because its half the price
i thought this game would be fun which it was some what but not as good as i thought it would be
what made me mad about the game was the aiming i spent so many rounds on solid head shots but it was as if they were going  feet over their head and another thing about the game is you could spend half a clip putting the rounds center mass and the guys still shooting at you
the grenades had no damage range what so ever they could be with in  feet of it with no cover and not take any damage what so ever
also with the melee attcaks the guys hitting you as if its a marvel vs capcom game as in the guys hitting you with non stop combosnow my last bad thing about this game is no story line or character reprensentation what so ever you dont get to know the other soilders at all its as if everytime your fighting its with a diffrent platoon everytime
so thats my thought on the game bad wise heres the good
i liked the thought of jumping into every mission i thought the fact of you landing in diffrent spots in a mission could help you or hurt you and it was all up to you where you landed and the olny other good thing was the missions were pretty long and thats about it and the weapons upgrades were kinda cool to deal with
i forgot to add this to the bad as someone who has been in the military and know the ranks why is a colonol wearing a private stripe on his shoulder just a thought to the medal of honor games creaters you may want to check stuff like that before you start selling the gameconsaiming is terriblecomputer enemy could take to much damageyou dont get to know the characters as in attitude or anythingand th ecomputer enemy has a crazy  melee attackthese creaters dont know their ranksproslong missionsthe concept of landing anywhere is pretty niceweapons up grade werent as bad as i thoughtand i wanted to add this part here i will never buy another wwii game again from the medal of honor series in fact if the new one that set in future time isnt rated m and goods a good review i will never buy another medal of honor game ever ill just stick to the good old call of duty games which seem to actually know how to make a good fps gamemissions are too difficult and long have to go back and get health kits most missions require a sniper rifle and other weapons under perform
the snipering works quite well it can be a snipering type of gamei was looking forward to playing this game as i have loved the first moh title
i was extremely disappointed however when i started playing this game
i dont know whether it was the pisspoor manual that didnt even explain controls like jump and removing the rifle grenade
i ended up accidently finding out how to jump in the th mission
not one place in the manual did it tell you that y is the jump button
who did the editing in the manual
i also didnt like the iron sights on the weapons
my guns jumped around too much and i wasnt able to get an accurate shot at long range
the sniper rifle which i loved in the previous titles is unforgiving and if you do anything less than a head shot be prepared to have to shoot your enemy againwhen you die the game makes you rejump out of the airplane again
if youve destroyed any objectives up to that point they are still destroyed except the game respawns all the bad guys you fought and killed before
that was stupid
this game could have taken a lesson from battlefield bad company and made sure the enemies were dead toofinding objectives with the compass was a pain in the rear
the compass helps only a little bit and when you do destroy an objective you have to do constant backtracking until you find a way to reach the next one
that was more annoying than anythingbuy at your own risk
the game does have good graphics and the ability to upgrade your weapons is nice but all in all if you are looking for a great wwii shooter just stick with call of duty  and world at waryou play as a guy named travers who is in the united states airborne division
basically your character and the rest of his troops jump out of planes and into different ww locations and basically either destroy something or kill nazis
theres really no story like the other medal of honor games where you feel that your character is doing something extrodinary like in frontline where you infiltrate a german base disguised as a nazi with some nazi papers
you get your usual array of weapons in this game ranging anywhere from the m garand and bar assault rifle to the panzershrek springfield sniper rifle and mp
however each gun is terribly inaccurate and do almost the same amout of damage as each other
what do i mean
well for example i will be holding a thompson machine gun i will literally empty and entire clip into one soldier and he will do
on the next victim i used the gweher and it took me an entire clip to lay him out
you are also awarded upgrades to your guns such as less recoil or a scope if you score enough headshots and kills with said guns
however most of the upgrades are completley useless since the aiming and recoil even with the upgrade for less recoil is still atrociouslets talk hit detection
pretty much no matter where you shoot a nazihe will simply shrug it off and run away
you could shoot him in the chest with a springfield which in real life would blow a huge gaping hole in his chest cavity hell stagger for a minute and then dive behind cover
this is extremley annoying and is actually one of the reasons a previous moh game did so bad anyone remember rising sun
the multiplayer is garbage
if your allies you parachute into the action
sounds cool right
not when enemies snipers just keep picking you off before you hit the ground
it probably wouldnt be so bad if you could oh i dont know shoot a gun while parachuting
basically your a target until you hit the ground
ontop of that your allies and enemies arent clearly labeled
so for instance youll see a character standing there with no name or anything above his head you kill him and boom you score a team kill because you had no idea
god so lameyour allies ai is disgusting
they will just stand there and get shot at without doing anything
the best example i have of this is in the th level where you are fighting in the city  i had an allied troop taking cover in a ruined building with an enemy standing right next to him
terribleand additionally i guess the game testers must have been sleeping when they gave this game the thumbs up
on more than one occassion bullets would go right through the walls or cover you are trying to hide behind
lammmeeeeeeeoh and expect to have a screaming match with your tv
this is one of the hardest titles ever
youll die over and over and over and over and over and over just to gain an inch of land and then have it taken away because the checkpoint system is garbage
since your ai is so bad and there are clipping issues youll basically be fighting the entire nazi army by yourselfthe graphics arent next gen and are actualyl a step down from what call of duty has set as a standard for the genre of ww shooters
characters look choppy the explosions are pixelated and sloppy and the only thing good about the graphics are the environments  gunsas for as music goes this has the worst soundtrack in the entire franchise
i was deeply dissapointed with the generic war time music used instead of the epic chorus and strings usually used
and the fact that the theme song isnt even the same is heart shatteringas far as im concerned the medal of honor games are dead
this is just a terrible game all around and its really sad because im a huge fan of the series
the sheer lack of effort in almost every aspect of the game makes this an untouchable title
 rounds spent in my garand out of i have been playing the medal of honor games since their inception
however this one is worst ever produced
are the graphics bad
no they are pretty good
how about the weapons and setting
those are pretty good toothe problem is that playing this game will really piss you offthe difficulty is really off on this one
sure you can take some hits but the enemies can take half a clip of  caliber ammunition and still charge at you too
also lets say you die you are started in a spot where it may take minutes  or  for your squad to show up and help you
so basically for some unknown amount of time you must fight the entire german army by yourself
phew my squad is finally here
i hope they can help me out now
aaaaawe they are all dead from a single grenade
your squad ai makes them act like a bunch of drunken raccoons rather than a crack airborne unitlets take some of the weaponswhen you fire a submachine gun you really cannot hit anything further than about  meters however when you have a rifle and are trying to hit a target at oh say  meters that guy is peppering you with submachine gun fire the whole time you are aiminghow about rocket launchers
everyone loves those
when you fire a panzerschreck at a tank it will take a good  hits before blowing up
also if a guy is standing behind a steel girder and you hit the girder with  rockets he is still not going to dienow lets move on to the ss troopers in the train yard that shoulder mgs
after i emptied a full bar clip into one guy and he didnt die i turned a  controller in a  pile of rubblehey since you are going to die often about every  seconds or so there must be a  good way to save your progress right
no not really
there is a checkpoint system in the game
this system however does not use your progress in different areas as some other games do
rather it uses the completion of a mission goal as a save point
not too bad right
the problem is that there are some missions where completing a mission goal can take quite a while
these same missions always appear to be the ones full of snipers and  nazis hiding above you in scaffolding
after the th time you try to get a particular goal you will know what i meani used to play both this game and call of duty rating them pretty equally but im afraid the mot franchise has gone downhill if this is the kind of offering they are moving forward withsave yourself some broken glasses controllers coffee tables etc
and buy one of the call of duty games instead
you will be  times happieri dont know what everyone else is talking about i think this game was very poorly made
the graphics arent that great at all
probably worse then call of duty 
the controls are sketchy and unconfortable
overall ea was just copying call of duty  but did a bad job
buy call of duty  its like  bucksi find this game to be really boring so far
reading the other reviews it sounds like i need to put in a few more hours of game play before it gets more interesting but im not sure that im willing to invest the time in it
the characters and dialog seem really childish and it just doesnt appeal to me at alltheres a dark skinned character in the game who speaks with poor english which strikes me as possibly racist
he says sumtin instead of something mah instead of my
all the dialog in the game appears to be translated by nonnative english speakers and i wonder if this is how japanese people think that dark skinned americans speak
im only a few hours into the game but this is the only dark skinned character ive come across so far and hes the only one who speaks like this
maybe theres something later in the game that would make me more comfortable with this characterclearly there are other adults who enjoyed this game so maybe im in the minority but for an adult id recommend something like sims castawayhaving made the mistake of ignoring reviews i rented this luckily i used enough common sense to do so and not buy it
quake wars brings you into a lesser known quake settingyour own planet
strongly departed from the old quake experience it at least draws upon some old familiaritiesthe games pc counterpart delivered the goods this once feels like faulty packaging
the online has many hiccupsand hideously poor graphics but one can get a good game going
the single player experience on the other hand is pretty much the same as multiplayer just without the whole social aspect tied inessentially youll be completing objectified missions broken down into easily digested proportions
objectives become very linear upon realizing the formula
making this definitely not a single player titleto justify no real single player or compelling story the multiplayer had to be top notch
unfortunately it isnt but has a great experience tracking system thats not going to save you know buddy
you can obtain upgrades briefly per match while only temporary they focus and reward the player for doing good based upon what class they are
matches very in length generally with a duration of about twenty minutes or so
long enough to complete objectives but on harder settings its a different storyone can easily maintain a good kill death ratio have great accuracy and a strong strategic planbut with dull ai
youre not going to get anywhere really
the timer runs out faster then you can defeat the enemy
problem is it becomes a one sided war more or less its only you doing all the fightingthe weapons lack variety the classes are dull and both the multiplayersingleplayer are lacking
the graphics as mentioned are cruddy but some decent lighting saves it a bit
the controls are decent frame rate not too bad
vehicles seem a bit unbalanced yet too weak when one uses them
the maps offer a bit of variety but not enough to save the game
given over the course of a week to play it grew on me a pinch still not worth a purchase though
desolation swept the online with a drought of players matches taking a long time to assemble the few players
enemy territory quake wars seemed like such a strong potential idea what happenedso yeah when this game first came out it was pretty cool but now that theres so much better stuff out there this game is just totally outdated
graphics are bad the gameplay is seriously lacking and the online basically doesnt exist since theres no one to play with
spent like  on this game and it isnt even worth this game is so similar to the original vf games that i am not sure why it even exists
it is the same gameplay same graphics same horrible dialogue and silly names
no unique characters
just the same old fighter with twitchy animations blocky character graphics claustrophobic arenas and outoftouch americanlike phrases
it is definitely not worth more than  or  dollarswe bought this game because wed played the longest journey and loved it
we thought the original longest journey was one of the best adventurequest games we had played in a long long timeunfortunately dreamfall really really disappoints by comparison
it is painfully evident that dreamfall was designed primarily to be played on a game console rather than a pc
like other adventure games which made a transition to console broken sword  for example the result is not a happy one
there are several serious flaws with this game gameplay  because it was designed for console the controls on this game are a real pain for pc players
we keep getting stuck in corners and taking a long time to extract ourselves from them the camera is always turning in the wrong direction and the simplest tasks become extremely frustrating because both the mouse and keyboard controls are a real pain the type of challenges   in a quest game the fun is usually in slowly unfolding a game by finding new objects talking to people and trying to figure out how to solve a puzzle or what to do next
in this game however most of the challenges are simply about jumping or fighting or running or something stupid like that which may be fun if youre playing a console game but arent fun if you are looking for an actual questadventure
when you do need to help someone or find an object this is always painfully simple you are told where to go you talk to the person you easily locate the object and bring it to them
where you come across something like a locked door which is often a challenge in quest games here the solution is usually something as simple as calling a friend on the phone linear  really ive never played a game quite as stupidly linear as this one
even the sherlock holmes games which are quite linear arent as bad as this
basically you cant do anything until you get things in precisely the right order
i cant tell you how many times we found ourselves yelling at the screen saying but we know exactly what we need to do
and not having the game allow this
for example in one particular instance you need to get a keypad code
you the player see someone else opening the keypad so youd think  the game would just allow you to walk up to the keypad and enter the code but no you have to get your character into a particular position in which they see this someone enter the code and then the character goes and enters it very lengthy cutscenes and dialogue that dont give you any additional informationthe result of all this is that dreamfall is essentially an interactive movie
you need to perform actions to move the plot along but the actions are pretty obvious and have to be done in exactly the right order
where you need to perform more complex actions these are never a challenge to your brain but rather to your ability to maneuver or fight using the cumbersome controlswe are now in the middle of the game after hours of gameplay and we are so frustrated by this that we are seriously considering not finishing the game which is very unusual for us
we are very disappointed by the fact that this games creators took an original that was exciting interesting and a model for the fact that quests are not dead  and turned it into a boring tired simple console game that is a pain to play on a pcmoh games on pc and ps have been quite lackluster since frontline but this game has really impressed me with the much improved graphics reaching the level of activisions call of duty seriesthe concept is well recieved but i still do not go for the idea of keeping stats for head shots etc along with the idea that every mission has certain quotas to meet as far as medals and badges are concerned this i believe can be eliminated as far as i am concernedas missions progress the enemies are more difficult to eliminate at times taking a full clip from an automatic weapon before dropping not to mention the super human enemies dressed in black
this takes away some of the realism with respect to weapon usei find the last mission very difficult to complete ive reached the last part of it and having a heck of a time completing it and i am on the easy mode
if you have patienceyou will like this gamethe good decent graphics different level design approach fast paced it doesnt last very longthe bad botched paratrooping mechanic ridiculously difficult monotonous level progression dead multiplayer brings nothing new to the tired genremedal of honor started the first person shooter world war ii experience back on the original playstation
as time went on they redefined the genre on pc with allied assault
it helped put wwii shooters feet on cinematic ground
frontline was the series last good game and slowly after that the series fell flat on its face with mediocrity with ea only caring about money
airborne continues this trend and its dead obvious how little effort they put into the gameyou play as a soldier named travers like we care at this point and you go through various wwii scenarios that you have probably gone through dozens of times before
the first thing you will notice about airborne is how repetitive it feels in comparison to other wwii shooters
it doesnt do anything new and retreads the same ground that we are sick and tired of
ea tried to make us feel different about this with a new approach to level design
you play as paratroopers that jump out of planes at the start of every level onto green flares
these are safe zones and contain crates of health ammo and grenades
once you hit the ground you will notice that your minimap is pointing to various objectives
no longer do you follow a linear routine and take it one at a time
pick a direction and run but thats when things start going badevery map plays out the same shoot some enemies push forward rinse and repeat ad nauseam
the enemies will keep coming in different pockets of the maps until you advance and take them out
this isnt a new trick and just gets old quick because that is all you do
place a charge on this aa gun blow up this equipment blow up these thanks
no thanks
i have done this countless times already so why do i want to do it here
the whole nonlinear map idea doesnt really work because it makes the game ridiculously difficult and you will die dozens of times every level
every time you die you jump back out of the plane loosing not objective progress but advancement progress
if you just pushed back a huge group of enemies and die you have to do it again
your objectives are just checkpoints and this gets frustrating beyond anything you can imagine
the game throws way too many enemies at you but there are even problems with weaponsthe game has a nice upgrade system for doing so many kills
for example the mp will upgrade with a double clip reduced recoil and a knife melee attack
this is the most interesting thing in the entire game but ea for some reason made the guns inaccurate to accommodate for upgrades
guns jump around more than you are used to and no matter how well your aim is you always miss about  of the time
once you hit the less recoil upgrade it isnt so bad
all the same wwii era weapons are here except the sten and it is yawn worthythankfully the game is short with only  levels so you can beat the game in about  hours
no matter how you slice it the game is just extremely hard repetitive boring and unoriginal on every level
they even went back to the health pack system which is just archaic in design
you would think at least jumping out of planes is fun
not really because if you dont grease or flare your landing you botch it and it involves a nauseating and disorienting animation of your character wobbling around while getting up and pulling the weapon out in a weird way
while this is happening guys are shooting you and you will recover with one health bar left
nice job ea for screwing every single thing in a game up that you possibly could
even the graphics are pretty bland and arent anything specialoverall airborne is probably the worst medal of honor game i have ever played
monotonous shooting ridiculous difficulty screwed up paratrooping mechanic failed level design and a retread of a genre everyone is tired of
do yourself a favor and skip this unless you really need a wwii shooter fix
forget about multiplayer as well because there are only  maps and no one is playing online anywaysnot to sure on this game i bought it thinking that my gforce gts graphics card would be able to support this game
but i was wrong you have to have a physx graphics excellerator in order to run this game
i am not much of a computer geek but i think that the gforce gpu that i am using is way more than sufficient to run this game more so than the physx gpe
a little disappointedcould have been great
the visuals are very nice
the ai is pretty decent too
i completed the game on the hardest setting in  hours
there are only  levels
the multiplayer value has yet to be proven and with better games like cod  and another halo fear and unreal comingyour money is definitely better spent else wherethe cover and descriptions look promising
we can build beach lots but thats about all the fun i received out of this expansion
never mind the fact that the island maps are so varied that certain lots only fit on certain neighborhood shorelines sims can now build sandcastles and swim in the oceanbigfoot
mysterious instructor
witch doctors
tour guides
fun the first time or two around but after that it gets old
if you play a lot of different sims youll have to keep bringing them to the three respective islands and have them master the local gestures and visit the same three creatures over and overi do enjoy the new items hammock was one of them and bon voyage adds pagoda roofs along with new furniture but really
i felt like this expansion was a major letdowni bought it used for  and i feel its still not worth iti wasnt expecting much but when i tried to use the controller on my ps the only thing that worked was the analog sticks when they were activated
the controllers all work on my old ps but not on the ps
i guess you get what you pay forthis not only lets your friends know that your broke but only  of the features work
i threw this back in the garbage so waste management can send it home on a barge to chinait served its purpose until i could buy a real  controller to use on my laptop to play some pc gamesindigo prophecyjade empirehalo  and etc
it was really good on certain games like pyschonautswanna know something funnyi was going to title this review airheaded because thats my oneword summation of the gamebut in a moment of absentmindedness when trying to get to this page i accidentally typed airheaded into the amazon search engine rather than crysis
the spooky thing is that at least as of the date of this writing when you type in airheaded into amazons search engine crysis maximum edition is the first search result returned
like amazon was reading my mindor more realistically i cant be the only guy thinking that this game is a little short on uh pabulum
not that a first person armageddonstyle shoot em up is supposedly to be heavily intellectual its just that weve seen this so many times before  you go around shooting a whole bunch of monsters gradually acquiring more and more powerful weapons until basically youre fighting satan himself at the endgood stuff
classic
but theres not a twist in sight here its just the same ol same oland it seems like they could have even thought out the brainless butchery a little better  the first section has you tromping through the jungle wasting a bunch of asians
what innovation
the second second is admittedly trippy
it involves floating through a jefferson airplanestyle alien mothership
promising but brief
guess what happens in the final section
youve seen it a million times before
only here your final adversary is so close and the camerawork is so shaky that you can hardly tell whats going onin short nothing new to offer
awfully stable engine thoughthe game is a superb fps until they have you fly
the controls are the worst i have seen in nearly  years of computer gaming
complete failure of design
the enemy stays right behind you and you have very little control over the aircraft
thankfully it only lasts a few minutesi just finished crysis and wow what a tremendous disappointmenti had some of the bugs other people mentioned but i am used to bugs
i thoroughly enjoyed stalker
 shadow of chernobyl and thats one of the buggiest games i have ever seen
bugs are apparently a part of pc gaming and i can live with them up to a pointi didnt have much trouble with the system specs either
i couldnt play it with everything maxed out but it looks very nice and the performance was not bad for me at mediumhigh quality settings
i will admit crysis is quite pretty to look at itthe thing that really destroys this game is that it beings by leading you through a boring labyrinth of utterly plotless sequences all the time building up to an alien invasion which looks like a promising second half of the game
on and on you travel thinking that at any time you will be fighting aliens in frozen jungles just like in the trailersthen just about the time you think its going to actually get to that second half the game suddenly and abruptly ends with a cliff hanger
i was literally sitting there looking at the credits rolling and thinking that perhaps there had been a glitch or that maybe it was a jokethis is one of the shortest games i have played in years on par with the half life  sequals and it ends up being nothing but a trailer for an idea that was never realised
its absolutely brainless and i have seldom felt so ripped off
the tiny bit of it that is available to play was just the basic run of the mill shooter game with better than average graphics
graphics are nice but please how about some content
how about a game that lasts more than  hours and actually has something even remotely like an ending
honestly if id had any idea i would never have bothered and as far as crytek goes thats going to be my approach from now onthis game lacks imagination and inspiration in every concievable way and if thats the next generation then i probably need to find a new way to entertain myselfblahby now there are certain things that the gaming community has come to expect from good firstperson shooters
not all firstperson shooters mind you just the good ones
and they dont necessarily have all of these things either just a majority is usually enough
unfortunately crysis falls well short of even this standarda good fps should have a variety of bad guys
doom gave us a huge variety of bad guys
duke nukem gave us a huge variety of bad guys
quake gave us a huge variety of bad guys
american mcgees alice star trek voyager elite force whatever the game is we dont want to spend days upon days upon days shooting endless hordes of only one kind of bad guy
crysis fails horribly here you spend the entire game shooting north koreans
they have about  different faces and carry maybe  different guns
yawn
nexta good fps should have a wide variety of settings
duke nukem and its build engine cousins blood redneck rampage and shadow warrior really set the bar here strip clubs prisons hotels restaurants meatpacking plants movie sets the moon etc
later games with more advanced engines did not falter elite force took place on alien ships with widely differing architectures and color schemes american mcgees alice offered broken chessboards rivers of magma and underground insect colonies and avp gave us everything from shake and bake architecture to jungles to the interior of an alien hive
crysis gives us a lot of sand dirt grass trees and rocks
and more dirt
over and over again
yawn
nexta good fps should have more guns than just your standard pistol shotgun machine gun sniper rifle and rocketlauncher
these are good and important things to have but we should also get a taste of something more exotic
the shrinkray and freezeray from duke nukem
the excalibat from rise of the triad
crowbars flamethrowers shurikens voodoo dolls lightning guns chainsaws lightsabers these are important too
sadly crysis has nothing of the sort in this departmenta good fps should have a story
it doesnt need to be a great story or even a good one
it just needs to let the player know why they are being told to go to this location push that button grab this keycard blow up that building
the accomplishment of one objective should result in a story segment that results in the next objective being given
crysis falls flat here
theres a story happening but youre never really told what it actually is or what relevance it has to what youre doinga good fps should make good use of whatever features it advertises as its main selling points
crysis shows repeated failures in this area
take the nanosuit for example
two of the modes  maximum speed and cloak  are utterly absolutely  useless because they only last  or  seconds after which your suit is drained of energy
maximum strength is mostly useless except for two map areas that exist solely for the purpose of requiring you to use strength jump in order to progress through the game
and although you can grab your enemies and throw them at each other this is another utterly useless feature mostly because its too difficult to do in combat against groups of more than  either the controls wont respond correctly when you try to grab someone or youll drop them for no reason or the target of your living projectile will be unaffected or some other nonsense like thatadditionally a good fps should actually have the features that it advertises as its main selling points
i will point to the allegedly high degree of interactivity and openendedness in the game
this is another area where duke nukem had set a pretty high bar more than a decade ago the player could turn lights on and off flush toilets tip strippers and even shoot pool
few games since then have achieved such a high level of interactivity but one would nonetheless expect a game like crysis to at least surpass something like i dunno doom  right
sadly not
in crysis your interactions with objects are limited to punchingshooting them picking them up and throwing them
thats it
notice that i didnt mention open doors anywhere
thats because you cant
thats right
you cannot open or close doors in crysis
you cant even knock them off their hinges with your superstrength
and heres something funny you can pick up living people and throw them but you cant do the same with dead bodies
if youre holding a live enemy and they die youre forced to drop them
what the hell
faila good fps should have multiplayer with capture the flag and bot support
crysis fails againand so on and so on maps are too big enemies are omniscient being limited to  guns is stupid frustratingly difficult blah blah blahnow for the areas where crysis does not fail graphics
theyre gorgeous you really can grab enemies and throw them at each other so there you have it
crysis is an overrated mess and a great step backward in computer gaminglets get one thing straight when people talk about graphics relative to crysis what they really mean is plants
yes it has pretty plants
hours and hours of them
but if your definition of graphics goes beyond plants then crysis graphics are dead generic
for the ahembest graphics of all time i could have used a bit more variety is all im saying
apart from the end when things get otherworldly youre looking at the same stuff the whole time
its much the same for the enemies
not much changes between baddies apart from the weapons they use
i should add that the korean enemies you mow down are voiced with such badly stereotyped fake accents they left me cringing
im not known for my pc sensibilities but if asians start returning this game i wouldnt blame themlike halo crysis suffers from slow running character syndrome
youd think that between sprint mode and powered super sprint mode youd be spared that feet in molasses feeling
but super sprint isbizarrelyonly good for  second bursts so youre left sprinting everywhere in unpowered mode no matter how hard you mash that shift key
so cajillion dollar power armor notwithstanding you leisurely jog through crysis
a pretty big design flaw of the nano suit if you ask me
i hope they kept the receipt
youd also think all the vehicles would help but the vehicles are fragile gutless clunkers which lurch around so alarmingly youre happy to ditch them
have none of these designers played that swamp boat level in halflife  that wore out my grin muscles it was so fun
what are they teaching in game design school these days that drains all the fun out of vehicular mayhemand what ever happened to bosses
you know those things that you occasionally fight at the end of levels which make games vastly more interesting and nonrepetitive
crysis doesnt do bosses
it doesnt even do boss situations where things ramp up in intensity before the level ends
your character is there to mark off his checklist and punch out
wheres the pacingwhat crysis does do well is firefights
there is endless chaotic gunblazing fun to be had
the enemy ai is pretty good which is rare
theyll surprise you with flanking maneuvers and strategic use of grenades
so if this is your main prerequisite for an fps you may want to check it out
but the game disappoints on most other levelscouldnt wait to get this game after the blast i had with far cryone of my favorite gamesi have a dell  with plenty of ram etc and a radeon  card that i added a little over a year agoi got the game home and it wouldnt run because of the cardcouldnt return the gamecurcuit city will only swap itinstalled nvidia cardthe game now plays and it reminds me of a far cry add onnothing all that wonderfuljust oki have always stayed away from playstationxbox etc because i alway have thought the grapics are betternow for this game im into  and maybe should have considered wii or a playstationoh i almost forgot i running windows xp and vista is really what i need to fully enjoy crysisill keep the dell for awhile and maybe santa will put a wii under the tree for mebuyer beware as other reviews have warnedis this game worth the upgrade or maybe even a new pc to play this game or the other new shooters on the horizonim loosing faith in pc games that are supposed to blow us all away and really dont deliver anything we havent already seen or playedalienware systemamd x  gig ramx gtx nvida cards sliplusesvisually stunning in the beginning areas there were a few moments that i had to show to whoever was around at the timesuit concept is good
would have liked to been able to upgrade itminusesthe games got very tedious around the core level
many of the aliens looked like extras from the matrix
the floating elements of the game were dull dull dullafter the core level a lot of it is run and gun
you need a lot of luck to get through some of the areas considering you can be killed with a single shot in many cases
after the th load its not challenging boys its freaking annoying
f was my very good friendi really loved farcry but this falls very short of that mark
it starts strongly but id have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that it seemed rushed towards the end
i had a lot of clipping problems as welland hey crytek how about a language filter
i had to make absolutely sure my kids were no where in earshotalso what gives with the weapons
i have a supersuit that allows me huge strength but i cant carry more than  rifles at a timeso yes like my title says the pretty but brainless date
nice to look at but wont keep your interestah well onto bioshocki was extremely surprised at this games low quality
i guess it somehow became famous due to the graphics being ahead of its time a few years ago and people use it to brag about benchmarking
the guns are not very accurate at all which is extremely frustrating
i couldnt even get past the onslaught tank mission on easyhad to use god mode
and im pretty damn good at most games
i could have gone back  saves and done what a guy on youtube does but i wish the game was just more fluid
i guess i should have known to conserve ammo  mins earlier in the mission eyerolls
all of the difficulty settings are pretty much the same
graphics are overrated and dont run well on my gtx  and dual core   and finally the story line is pretty lame
almost no cut scenes no character development none of that stuff
you just randomly shoot asians which normally i think is funny but this time i do notget just cause  insteadif you played far cry then you know what this game is about and what you were expecting
the graphics are fantastic but the game play is on a lower level when compared to far crypros basically you are getting more far cry
long over due
excellent graphicsnew weaponsnano suit  give you super human abilitiescons linear game play with too many scripted events
in other words you cannot venture around and find alternate attack routes as much as you did in far cry and as soon as the game hits a save point you know action is about to happen
it takes away all the surprisebuggy
this game crashes a lot
you can review different gaming forums and read the horror stories
pretty pathetic for the excellent team of people behind crysis to have released this clunker piece of manure out before it was well tested
i cannot play for more than  minutes without  crashing out
yes i am updated and even running the latest nvidia beta drivers designed to resolve crysis problems
this is kind of just like far cry all over againanother scientific experiment gone wronganother batch of aliens invades the earththe worst part is you spend the entire nd half of the game fighting aliens
ughhhhhhhh
also the ai was crappy
i found the enemy to be very stupid and not very aggressive
in far cry the soldiers would come after me flank me attack hard
i almost could fall asleep at times waiting for the soldiers to do something
this could have been the game we were waiting for
instead it is a clumsy half finished unpolished remake of a great gamefirst to the obvious this game is beautiful
the graphics were groundbreaking when it was new in  and are still maybe the most beautifully detailed ive ever seen i didnt even try to run it until i built a gaming rig in 
if you have the computing power theyre really just gorgeousthe beginning where you infiltrate an island overrun by prnk troops to rescue scientists is a lot of fun
the gunplay is good and the suit powers are cool if awkward to activate i wish you could do it with your voice
the gorgeous scenery is a pleasure especially in winter when itd be nice to see some sun and green irlnot to give spoilers but once you reach a certain point the game turns dramatically more science fiction and from there it kind of lost me
the new enemies arent as much fun for me the vehicle episodes are frustrating and suddenly my system starts crashing frequently
i dont think its a specs problem because i have pretty high end hardware that had no trouble rendering the lush jungles at max settings but i experience crashes at high and medium late in the game including on menu screens
i uninstalled and reinstalled which didnt fix this problemi usually dont bother to write reviews but this game was too disappointing to let goill keep this short graphics are very good
i loved far cry and the first half of crysis was indeed far cry with more eye candypros great graphics  texture features explosions etc
also no steamesqe account joining or online activation
just load and play
keep it that way game developerscons many  bugs here and there including the big one that stopped the game for good  shooting the big boss on the carrier  gun would not target
had to quitim assuming that was the end worse story line was dull
shooting thingies that looked like those in matrix over and over again got downright boring
far cry was immersive and compelling  with so many interesting and even scary chapters and gameplay that lasted seemingly days
crysis does not deliver in those ways
ai was bland and fairly unintelligentagain this is a short review
perhaps im getting too old for pc games  but compared with half life unreal  and even the earlier dooms    all of which i found compelling and creative crysis falls short almost flat
sgraphicsthe game has good graphics and physics
even that is overrated
i am not impressed with it
i was x more impressed with graphics from another modern game about warfaregameplayafter shooting down a couple of trees the game quickly becomes stale
the suit is useless because you can only use abilities for about  seconds
people say that the game is open exploration
yeah it is but there isnt much to explore besides jungle and the occassional korean outpost
you mostly have one mission and you follow the nav point to get there
you are extremly weak running into a camp full blast is useless
i had to sneak everywhere invisible and snipe with my machine gun to keep from getting killedmy final thought
overrated
and boringyou would think that if valve implemented something that was able to register and verify their product online they would make a system that would work
if it doesnt work then why not just do it the way that everyone else does it
i mean if you are going to make users go through all the trouble of having to verify the game over the internet then shouldnt the process of playing the game after validation be hassle free
after all we paid for it
we should be able to play itim having nightmares trying to get anything to play except for peggle
i have been able to play a little bit of portal
the problem is that the local gcf files are corrupted and the support page tells you nothing about them
so youre left with downloading gcfscape and verifying each gcf file is not corrupted and deleting them if they are and then opening up steam again to download
except that the next download is corrupt too so you have to start the process all over again which takes hours
meanwhile you cant play anythingthey need to make the process of downloading and extraction more foolproof or they need to make steam a little bit more verbose when there is a hangup or both
controlling the verification of authenticity over the internet is fine by me
but if you are going to go that route  be sure that process is as hassle free as possibleamazed that i had to buy a bunch of games i already own as well as others i do not want in order to get ep  what a scam
i bought orange retail and while installingactivating through steam i kept getting server errors and told to try again later
maybe its just me but when i lay  hard earned dollars down for a game i want to take it home and play it after all i own it right
 wrong
valves steam software dictates when i can play
well when i finally got ep  up and running the next day it was ok  nothing special and certainly not worth  maybe  but at least they gave me a bunch of other games i could care less about
ive finally come to the realization that my steam days are over
valves steam has become more oppressive than the combineas much as this is sort of a fun game to play i just cant the date source graphics engine
this looks so  i know graphics aint all but there are many other great fps games with better graphics id rather play
i bought lfd and quickly got tired of this non sense shooting at  corps at once all the time and lfd didnt got me excited enough to buy it
more of the same thingsi think this game is a overhyped been theredonethat kind of thing
really wheres the strategy in all the mindless killing of zombies
yeah if you just want to shoot something over and over its fun but if you want more in the way of game content and innovation then look else where
valve games are all over hyped with hl as the exception
i have been playing pc games for years and i cant believe so many fan boys here buy into it
there is so much more to pc gaming with fallout  being a great example of a real game
my honest opinion about lfd is that its nothing but a updated version of last years hell gate london but done better
good luckthe first problem with this game is the necessity to deal with steam
do not buy a used steam enabled game
you will be out of luck when the license needs to be validated
the advantage is that the game can be installed in multiple pcs with a single steam id then played from any one pc without the original media
left  dead for my taste seems to be too repetitive for single player
i am not able to indulge in multiplayer very much
for a single player the most fun zombie game is stubbs the zombie in rebel without a pulsethe game requires an internet connection to connect to steam in order to install the game but this fact does not seem to be mentioned anywhereive used steam before
maybe it is alright for playing online but it is a royal pain in single player action and you are required to use it
anddont lose your password to steam because you will never get it back and the game is as good as worthless when that happensi have enjoyed all of the predecessors to the moh version for its originality and effects
this version is more frustrating than enjoyable
i want be long but some of the key disappointments are that despite how seasoned you are as a first person shooter you will be incredibly inaccurate
you can have clean shots but the game will not accept it as a direct hit
to drop an opponent you can often times go through half a clip especially the android like nazis toward the end of the game
moh will provide interesting drops and sometimes you have to go behind the lines to have a chance
you can not command your team and the computer is not quick to let them lead into a fight
you will feel as if there are endless enemies as they will pop up on the radar every turn even if you double back for ammo weapons exchanges or health
finally no matter the angle you will take a hit before you get a beam on the enemy
you can not crawl only kneelit is a challenge for the diehard gamer but not as enjoyable as its competitor codthis game is not the greatest
have to many things to do and just difficult for an older adult to figure outnot at all what i was hoping for
im big on single player first person shooters that follow a deep story line like quake did
this is all mission based with no save or game story progress to follow
its basically like playing an online multiplayer game by yourself
aside from the fact that this ruins it for me those who like this kind of game are in for a treat
lots of controls every key on the keyboard and mouse are bound to some function selection or action and the graphics are very good while not over demanding on your hardware
im using a gforce  gt and was able to crank up all graphic settings to their maximum values while running at x deff
it is however a very nice collectors box for those of you who like to collect pc games
just dont expect a good single playerstory based experiencei decided to buy this game after i finished all my phoenix wright and apollo justice games i really like investigation type of games and since i really love the csi series i decided to go and give this game a try
i really think this game is very hard
i just cant figure out where to go next or what tool to use on what to collect evidence
i started using the walkthrough to help me out but it just gets to the point where you have to use it all the time and playing like this is just not fun to me
i have also played hotel dusk and really enjoyed it but to me this game does not resemble hotel dusk at all
very frustratingi rented it and personally thought it was so bad that i turned it off and watched a movie instead
it starts out with the mayor walking you around and having you build stuff
i personally thought that it was a little difficult and i hate to say it but stupid to build things
my house and workshop looked weird nothing how i would have liked to build them
then the mayor told me to put a chair together and i had had enough this is when i hit the power button
maybe i didnt give it enough of a chance but i dont really want to
give me a new version of sim city for wii i have downloaded the old one on my wii for  and played it for hours and hoursi have never played any of the other settlers games and this one piqued my interest when i first heard about it
ive been flirting with the idea of picking it up for the past several weeks and i finally didi am extremely disappointedfirst of all  i thought the demos tutorial was a onetime thing
no  your very first mission in the real game requires you to complete the same tutorial with no option to skip it
after this  you figure the tutorials are over wrongyour hand is held constantly through each mission and they basically walk you through exactly what to do
there is no challenge to this
what is worse  you begin each mission in the same position having to rebuild the same exact buildings having to watch your goldstonewoodfood crawl up to the same exact level having to do the same exact upgrades and then  just as you hit the fun part and your settlement starts rolling alongnew mission
repeat everything againthough it looks pretty at first and you might not mind building up a settlement the first time  having to do it over and over and over and over with no variety and crappy voice actors hand holding you through every step and forcing you to click through their dialogue is not funthis game has potential but ultimately it is completely lacking in complexity and most importantly fun
i uninstalled it after  minutes and it is going on the shelf to collect dust now
when it says ages  on the box  just read age  or belownot too sure about this onereal life is much less complicatedall you need to do is file and sort out insurance forms and divorce papersi guess i did not learn much about the life of lawyersthis game was a horror
i had played assassins creed and gears of war just before getting this and decided that maybe the xbox ports werent so bad after all than i installed lost planet
the gameplay is uninspired with run of the mill weapons and a senseless storyline with poor dialog and passable voice acting
the graphics are a joke i ran gears full blast on my system and it was beautiful
this game looked like it was an entire generation behind it barely provided quake  level visuals
level design was almost interesting because of the grapnel that you carried but otherwise suffered from the limited graphics and anemic game playoverall the game was a huge disappointment and once again i will have to consider carefully before i purchase another game ported from a console
i thought we had gotten past that but i guess noti bought this game for a cheap price so i wasnt expecting much out of it
however there were only  levels yes  levels of play in the entire thing and some items you had to find were repetitive
definately a game for kids  and underi am looking as are many other people for a bejeweledlike game for ds
this is sort of the same but its not as much of a challenge
there are more automatic scores
the music is better than bejeweled s tho
im going to keep this one in mind and keep looking
there doesnt seem to be any way to turn off the timer a feature i would like
mbps
i played the online free version at i think iwinupdate   wonders is the best substitute for bejeweled
see my review of this game theresquares mana series is probably only second to final fantasy in terms of popularity with a few games already on the ds
heroes of mana attempts to bring a pc style rts to the ds with disappointing results to say the least
the structure of heroes of mana is what kills the game with some horrendous unit path finding and an incredibly slow pace to the overall gameplay
not to mention that the multiplayer aspects are incredibly unbalanced and force both players to finish the single player campaign first to achieve any sort of balanced playing field
all the negatives aside though heroes of mana does have a few things going for it
the games interface is easy for newcomers to the genre to pick up and great for veterans to navigate as well which is about the only real plus there is to heroes of mana
the unit balancing is nicely done as well and simple enough to get a hold of but other than that the rest of heroes of mana is a boring and tired excursion
all in all heroes of mana is worth a look for fans of the mana series or rts fans that own a ds but all others should avoid and are better off looking elsewhereyou know i like rts games in general and this one looked to be a good one
i read about it and checked a lot of online details about the game before i decided to pay full pop retail for a new game release
after about  hours of play i have to say that its easy to play but not immersive
i just cant get into it
novelty factor  hours then i lost interest
there is a lot of depth to the game but it is more work than fun when you get past the eye candyran well on my computer at mediumdefault detail settingsos vista ultimatecpu amd athlon  x dual core am memory  mb ddrdual nvidia gpus nvidia geforce  gs in sliit could not handle high or very high detail
frame rates dropped to unplayable during action
i have to assume that this game would not play well on older pcs
the game has a built in benchmark utility that was useful
i liked that a loti played the demo to world in conflict
i would have to say the game is very much like the recent command and conquer with the aspect of troop limitations and gameplay
the gameplay is difficult with the idea that any fight could turn either direction
i still dont fully understand the complete aspect of the game
but for just a few hours play i am going to say that the actual experience can be obtained through command and conquer
i will not be purchasing this game
i am entitled my own opinion but feel free to try out the demothis isnt what an rts should be
to that end if youre a starcraftwarcraft fan youll find this game extremely closeended and unentertaining
i became bored in the first  missions and as impressive as the trailer or intro make it look its much more dull and definitely not what youd expect if youre used to basebuilder rts games like age of empires starcraft sins of a solar empire the only good kind in my opinionafter being excited for several months prior to the release of this game i was sorely disappointed after playing this game for the first couple of hoursthe game is completely scripted and there is no deviating from the script
each mission simply consists of you moving your units around to the designated spots so they can automatically shoot enemies for you
simply put there is no strategy in this game
the computer is looking for you to do something and if you do it then you pass the missionthose looking for a recreation of cc should go elsewhere
although the graphics are great and if you have dx you can run dualmonitors it simply does not make up for the  you have to spend to move tanks and troops around in a predefined fashionnba live has always come in second place to nba k games atleast to me
live has always had excellent ideas but the game has always suffered from sloppy gameplay with little details to the small things that make up a basketball game
once again some great ideas carried through with bad gameplaythere is one aspect i need to discuss first
passing is terrible
i know they want to make passing more realistic but i had garnett posting up on a defender right in front of the active players face and i pressed to pass and rondo bounced the ball on the ground hard and it made garnett jump for it
i mean honestly is there a point in that
and sometimes when i turn on the passing icons ill press square or whatever other button i want to pass it to and my player wont even pass
sometimes my player will just throw the ball away when i pass
its very nervewrackingalso foul calling is about stupid
if you run over a defender when youre on offense its an automatic offensive charge
now if the situation is switched and youre defending dont hold your breathe on getting a charge
even when you press the button for a charge and your player goes in motion youll get ran over but no foul will be called
half the time when i get called for a reach in i didnt even see my players hand move towards the ball
half the time i dont even go for a stealthrough games i cant shake the feeling that im playing in an arcade
it just feels so fake
the graphics are fine when im the celtics i can tell whos ray allen whos pierce and whos garnett but the feeling of simulation is too strong
when you go for a rebound the player may not even be that close to the ball but somehow it lands in his hands
layingup is a bit more animated but also looks fake
how can ai lay it up over garnett and odendespite the poor gameplay there are redeeming extras and a deep franchise mode
in franchise mode you get to go through the nba draft i landed oden for the celtics and hire a coaching staff
they incorporated a new rumor central thats kinda like a news feed but not exactly news yet
you can read and research all the speculation of signings trades releases and others
you can have your assistant work on players to make them better and have him set up practices events and days off to help fatigue and team chemistry
you can check what players have to say about the team to know what changes are to be made
its the best kind of franchise ive ever played honestlythere are other extras like the allstar weekend and fiba world championship
the allstar weekend is fun where you can play the rookie challenge the point shootout the allstar game or the celebrated slam dunk contest
i have to admit the slam dunk contest is hard but fun
you can go to the slamdunk school but it really doesnt help you with your dunk any
the fiba world championship brings other countries basketball teams in to the picture who you can also play with in exhibition gamesoverall the franchise mode and the allstar weekend dominate this game
for me though id rather have more realistic ingame play than added features
if an nba game added the graphics and gameplay of nba k and the franchise mode of live i would never put my controller down
but since that isnt gonna happen soon i think id rather stick with nba k
but if a deep franchise mode is what you want then go for this one
for now ill passthe control itself sucks  passing is akward shots look weird players dont move like they do in real life when setting up a playgraphics are disappointing as welli liked nba live  better than this gameit seems to be choppy and doesnt flow like a bball game shouldok ive been a simpsons fan for bout  years now so theres definitly a certain level of excitement to play them in a video game
the characters do for the most part stay true to the show and there are many funny clips that are enjoyable
the fun however stops here
the gameplay is very poor and for me extremely frustrating
it pretty much plays like a lowbudget game with poor camera angles subpar graphics and annoying and pointless tasks
even as a simpsons fan i can only give this game  stars
good to have as a novelty but if youre looking for a good time look elsewhereit is nice to be able to blow everything up
i like the ability to land on boats with a helicopter and steal the boat and i like the fact that it draws objects really far away
with this game though the glitches and stupid button combinations you have to do to hijack vehicles i wont buy a mercenaries  because of this kind of make you want to blow the game itself up
the npcs are dumb as toast
getting them in and out of vehicles was easier in the first game
the physics seem to be only slightly better than the first gamebottome line this game can be a lot of fun its got some replay value as well but its not worth 
factoring in the frustration from being kicked off a tank time and time because you didnt press x fast enough and having civilians leap out at your speeding vehicle like depressed lemmings this game is worth about mercenaries  is the poster child for a flawed gem
whether or not you can tolerate the flaws will dramatically impact your view of the game
thats part of the reason why review scores for mercs  are all over the spectrumthe premise of mercs  is relatively simple this game isnt about story per se but does feature a somewhat entertaining if not clicheacuted storyline
youll start by picking one of  available mercenaries hired to rescue a certain general by a rich venezuelan
shortly thereafter youre betrayed by your employer and promptly shot in the butt
thus begins your quest for revenge and the basic premise for mercenaries situated in venezuela the environments are varied everything from cityscapes of caracas and maracaibo to the jungled mountains of the amazons
the bonus of all the nice scenery is that much of it is completely destructible
and that ability to wantonly destroy your surrounds is what ultimately mercs  is all about
graphics are largely improved from mercenaries original outing
though the graphics in mercs  pale in comparison to other graphical powerhouses of the current console generation
make no mistake though the scale and destruction in mercs  will impress all but the most biased graphics connoisseursmercenaries biggest detraction is its apparent complete lack of beta testing
the game as is has been patched and is still so utterly full of bugs and glitches that it becomes difficult to play at times
glitches vary from the funny randomly floating objects and enemies to the weird enemies will stop shooting at you while you can still shot them the the frustrating game freezing and objectives becoming unattainableits difficult to convey just how many and how frequent glitches can and do occur
ill give a rundown of some  of the glitches ive encountered high value target fell through the map and was inside a building he shouldnt have been able to enter
required restart of mission helicopter frequently gets stuck or lost preventing the collection of items
requires patience high value targets kill themselves frequently
requires restart of mission if playing for the aces high trophy the ingame physics will cause you to lose challenges frequently because youll either crash or loose the payload of your vehicle enemies stop attacking you
can be viewed as a bonus as this makes the game extremely easyto further add insult is the frustrating design choices by the developer
failing a mission or failing to collect a high value target alive requires you to either quit the game completely and reload you last save file
or in the case of certain missions youll be medevacd to your base only to lose all of your weapons and have to trudge halfway across the map back to the point where you were killed
the ability to instantly restart a mission or a load data function wouldve been niceanother problem with the game is the yoyoing difficulty
enemies will at one moment be completely brain dead virtually running into your bullets and then next theyll be using rpgs as sniper rifles from  yards awayall in all what saved this game for me was the fact that its undeniably fun
the premise of wrecking havoc in the air on land and sea across a huge varied landscape is still appealing
unfortunately the lack of polish is ultimately what keeps this game from being greatthe ruind the game i like action not to be runing up and down with a uglyest mercenary in the world i were especting more actionthis game is okit has its good points but is loaded with flawsyou are a mercenary paid to destroy and killchoose between  people chris jacobs jennifer mui and mattias nielsonprossame controls as mercs swimmingboatstropical environmentnew vehiclesconscant kill civilians and you lose money when you hit or shoot themboring storyboring mission structuresame weapons as mercs driving mechanis have decreasedtargeting hasnt improvedflying is hardcant destroy everything like in mercs all in all this game gets  cause it still is mercenaries
just soso lazyupdate  ive played this title a bit more over the long weekend and while the controls are still less than ideal it is actually a fun title
mario galaxy is still far more fun to play but the multiplayer option in this game is nice
however the gameplay is still quite akward even with  players
i will keep this game and i am sure i will finish it one day but who knows whenoriginal reviewlet me start by stating that i am a longtime gamer and a diehard simpsons fan
i have played every other simpsons game to date and have to admit that this one dissapointed me the most
first the goodthe animation cut scenes and gameplay is great
you really feel immersed in an simpsons episode
the game dialog and situations are funny and classic simpsons
coop mode was a good idea
if it wasnt for the negative aspects of this game this would have really shinednow for the bad
the control schema for this game is beyond aweful
the camera is difficult to reposition the character movement is difficult
in no time i have a headache and am completely disgusted with playing this title
this really ruined the game for me
i died  times just trying to jump from donught to donught in the tutorial level
sad
perhaps the worst control schema i have seen on any wii game and i have seen some pretty bogus oneswhat
no online coop
i think they really blew it not allowing you to choose an online partner to play the coop mode
i mean its not like my wife is gonna sit down and play with me right
seriously any  player game these days should be online compatible
tsk tskother than that nothing else to say about this game
in all seriousness if the controls werent so horrid i could have beared playing this game further
but now that i have mario galaxy and mariosonic at the olympics why bother
save your money mario galaxy is awesome and the controls are niiiice
hthtjif you are buying or playing this game you had better love the simpsons in general
the game play is rough at best with th ecamera shifting all around
the animated sceens look spectacular however once game play starts the visuals decline big time
its the same run around and punch with homer for  levels and thats when i just quit
i couldnt waste anymore time on a game that was this unappealing
we tried the  player split screen but that just enhanced the shortcomings of the camera
i would not recommend
the lone bright spot was the funny oneliners that homer and family spits out randomlyive been an avid fan of the simpsons since it was first introduced when i was  years old and i have played simpsons games through the generations and been able to forgive them for being subpar in quality
this simpsons game is unlike its previous ones this one is unforgiveablethe bottom line is that the camera angles of the game are too frustrating to manage
other d games have their share of camera frustrations but none so bad as this game
furthermore you never know which items in the background you can use and which you cant
some platforms that you need to jump on in one part of a level become background in the next and you never know if the landscape you are looking at is able to be utilized or not
also the gravity is too intense in this game it is very difficult jumping from platform to platform because its like youre wearing metalplated boots when you have to make big jumps
other d games like the halo series the super mario bros series and the tony hawk series all have unrealistic gravity but it works in gameplay
the simpsons game however makes it impossible for this game to be enjoyed between the problems with gravity and with camera angles
the result of this combination is an impossibly frustrating game that not even diehard simpsons fans can enjoythis game is great in theory
a simpsons game in which the real actors lend their voices to a minirpg
genius
but again only genius in theory failed in execution
the people who gave this game a star review are being unreasonable as most of them even admit they wanted to turn the game off in frustration after dealing with the camera angles
how can a game that has terrible camera glitches earn  stars when it has such a basic problem
its not fair to give this game  stars and i dont think its even worth a renti give this game  stars rather than  simply because the cutscenes were funny and they got the real actors to do the voices
also the tutorial level was fun it all goes downhill from theresame as boogie superstar not very nice in its ratings of you and had a super long tutorial that brought the party down
not a problem we just switched to our just dance games which are a hoot
seller delivered as promised so dont hold it against them that the game stinkshi this game is ok  this is my first time with a singing type game
the words are changed on some of the songs which is annoying and all the actions dancing and singing with the wii mote and the microphone is too much for meas someone who loves karaoke i was really looking forward to the release of boogie on the wii
however i was very disappointed with itin boogie youre doing one of two things singing karaoke  or dancing
the dance portion of the game is overly simplistic and not really dancing at all
all you do is swing the controller back and forth with the beat making your character dance
the song selection is absolutely horrible
there are a few good ones but most of the songs seem to be geared towards girls in middle schooldont bother with this one
its not even close to worth the  youll pay for itboogie is a game that claims to be a singing and dancing game
however you can only do one or the other at a time  and the song list is fairly limitedthe game is sold with a usb microphone which plus into the back of the wii system
this is necessary for the singing half of the game
luckily it can also be used with other usb systems computers etc so at least if you dont like the game you do still get a microphone out of the purchaseyou are expected to have a normal wiimote with a nunchuck for the dancing portion of the game
however take note that you cant sing and dance at the same time
its one or the otherthe song selection is fairly limited and only a select few songs are available when you start the game
you have to unlock the rest often doing things youre just not fond of doingso there you are dancing to abc or brick house
by dancing i mean that you are swinging your wiimote left and right
literally
i suppose you could swing it up and down instead
once you power up your charge bar you can do a simple leftleftrightright style followtheleader to get an extra bonus
and thats pretty much it
occasionally you use your nunchuck to walk over to a special token powerupthe game has a fairly cool video editing system where you can record your dance moves and add in special video filters and change the camera angle
that part is neat  but the thing you are recording is so simple that its really not worth itwhy cant you sing and dance
why cant you do fully body movements like you can in so many other dance games
i absolutely adore dance games
i adore singing games
this should have been the absolutely perfect fusion of the two
instead i ended up sitting on the couch bored swinging my controller left right left right
then up and downthere are so many other brilliant games out there that involve dance and song
i cant really see why someone would go with this one with its meager customizationas a final issue the songs are covers and some are quite poorly done
so you dont even get the enjoyment of hearing the songs you lovei would avoid this one
there are plenty of other better optionsrating boogie is a karaoke game that looks promising but falls flat after the upbeat grease intro
the singing portion is fine probably one of the better features of the game
if this is what you want then you are better off buying karaoke revolution
dancing consist of you rhythmically flicking the controller and nunchuck instead of fun its just tiring
the missions   are uneventful too much dialogue to read and younger players would have trouble
the video maker  is fun at first but the repetitiveness and lack of selection make it boringi dont recommend this game
maybe if you could get it cheap it might be good at a kids party but thats about iti thought this game would be something like ubrz in the city or bustin out with missions to complete and fun things like that
but this game is no fun at all
you are stranded on a desert island and you have to try to get off
the conversations with people are no fun and the objectives are unclear and no fun to complete
i like sims game but not this one
save your money and buy something fun like thrillvillewhile it does have some things that hint at its origins in terms of the same people who made diablo  its not anywhere near a diablo caliber game
the gameplay is bland boring and a grind
overall it has neat graphics soso gameplay and absolutely nothing to make it memorable or interesting
the only thing it had going for it was an association with diabloblizzard and that is all for naught
dont buy this game you can do much much betterin a word boring
too much effort spent on lighting effects such as weapon flash or demon attacks and too little time on the environment
the levels are so similar that they quickly become tedious so much grey grey grey everywhere
the way the npcs jump and jerk around bugs in  their pants
when youre interacting with them is irritating
also because of a game flaw they can be in two places at the same time and remain after their dead with one npc superimposed on another
all this time spent to develope the game with so little to show for it
certainly not the worst game ever but dont pay more than 
the story line
hmm not sure of what to say there confusing
all the weak parts of diablo with little of the gooddiablo where do i startfor some reason i got the impression this was a shooternopeill do the goodbad reviewinstallinguuugh
if you have vista prepare for one blocked attempt after another
it took many tries to find the patch to download and finally restart my computer and finally playopeninggood not muchbad the building of a character was very minimal
not a whole lot of room for changing your character
i guess i got too used to obliviontutorialsgood not muchbad as you are dropped into your first screen the tutorials last about  seconds and fade away before you can realize what you just readgame playgood at first i thought nice one hit zombies that get harder to kill and enemies changed somewhat quickly with each task you are sent onbad the same monsters are all identical
one zombie looks exactly like another
your character movements are very stiff
no you can not free roam around
in order to go to a new zone you have to accept a task to go there
right and left mouse click seemed to do almost the same attack
nothing special there toooverallif you love games like titan quest and dungeon seige have fun
its like they tried to mix them with oblivionit just looks like they upped the graphics from those games and dropped this on us
i saw nothing really new here
the graphics arent bad
just not all that impressive
voice acting was nothing to frown on but not really acting eithermultiplayer i wasnt impressed enough with the single player to try itso blizzard has made more money off world of warcraft than any game in history and the former diablo ii team members who did not move over to work on world of warcraft left to form arenanet and make guild wars an excellent series of game i might add pretty much the rest of that team later left blizzard to form flagship studios and to make their vision of what diablo  should have been and that game is hellgate londonso how is it
if you liked diablo  it wont take much the controls will take some getting use to but the concepts and even a lot of the ui look from diablo ii has carried over here
this is all good except that the genre has really innovated beyond diablo  since it appears diablo  will never get a real successor i would say guild wars which came out in  still alive and relevant today through an expansion and new campaigns is as good as you can get and it really improved upon several of diablos flawshellgate feels a lot like diablo  but it also feels dated
the graphics  just a touch subpar for their system requirements i would say and overall theres just a feeling that the game was rushed
it feels like youre playing a beta product
the voice overs often seem misplaced and plan bad
the map has no compass and reviewing your quest log is a bit of a hassle
the control is tight but you can be running fine at fps and get mobbed my enemies and drop down to fps
the problem i have against hellgate is a collection of little things that add up to make it overall far short of the fantastic title it could have beenyou would think at least they got the multiplayer part right but they did not and they want to charge for a guild and basic multiplayer ideas that are available free in other gameshaving said that if you skip newer games like guild wars and go from into hellgate from the now very old diablo  you probably wont realize what all youre missing and may enjoy it a great deal more than i have so faroverall not recommendedi bought the game from target a week or so after it came out
and havent touched it in maybe  months
given that take this review with a grain of saltthe game out of the package can only be described by one phrase
not complete
i have heard there have been large patches and updates
i dont want to go too much into the details of the game upon release because it was so long ago i just want to say
try before you buy
find a friend that has it and try it out it has the potential for a great game but when i played it out of the box it just was not there yeti never played diablo much but i know this every sewer in this game looks the same
every building in this game looks the same
every city area in this game looks the same
thats it
 maps basically
and monster variety
please
i could count  monstertypes youll see  of the time
and this is a huge huge turnoff for this game there is no respec
read
investigate
study
spend hours and hours reading because when you put a skill point somewhere you aint never gettin it back
no way
no how
and so if you screw it up youll say oh well trash this character lets reroll
yeah
same maps again
are you kidding me
hell yeah i wanna do those again
noti tried playing this game twice and will probably never go back to it
the controls and the camera are very sloppy and amateurish
pointing out cliche gameplay doesnt make it any better its still fairly boring
maybe later levels would be better but i just cannot be bothered playing to them
i thought hit n run a much better gamethis game is too hard so i took it back to gamestop the camera doesnt work good so you cant manuver through the levels any good and i dont reccomend it it was a huge let down
only lasted a few hoursfor a video game that spends  of its time making fun of video game cliches this one has one more it could add to its list the movie property video game that doesnt hit the spot
to compound matters this is the onehundredth simpsons game to appear on the market and game designers still cant nail itthe game  and conversely gamers  delights in poking its tongue out at various video game styles and genres even using dialogue sounds from other games to drive the point home
the problem
its not anywhere near as fun as half the games it makes fun ofits too easy to progress through the missions arent terribly long and this game easily has the worst camera control in any game ever
the controls in general are a mess
for a game with graphics this simple it certainly struggles to do even simple tasks righti have my beef with the games that come out  or that dont come out often enough  just like every other gamer
thanks for pointing that out bart and homer and marge and lisa
but could you have done it with a game that was actually fun to play
the jokes are cool but i dont buy games for jokes
i buy them to enjoy playing a solid gamethis game shouldnt cost what new games cost
rent it if you must but dont but it unless you can get it usedoverall this game would be great but ea has had some programming problems in this particular version of the gamepros realistic in some ways  devastating checking if you line them up rightcons balance between the computer goalie and your goalie is horrible every computer controlled player has the ability to make your players look like rookies when they have the puck even the ones you know arent offensive players
sloppy coding in the game which causes the game to stop runing even when your ps is working correctly
the new controls are horrible and you cant default the set up to the classic controller scheme
the interface that you use to advance through the season becomes jittery and almost unstable looking when youre simulating the days you dont have games to play
penalties are balanced so that the computer will be on the power play a lot more than you
the computer dives too much without being penalized for itif i could play more than one game without it having problems it would have a higher rating
but this is a problem that i had with the xbox  version as wellhad an issue with multilayer not working and the game became repedative half way beating itto summarize my feeling of the game the ending noncinematic of the game is a series of correctly timed button taps
who on earth would wrap a game up with a combination of shoulder button a b dpad up
it makes no sense whereas the prequel had an epic battle this game ended with a feeling that the designers were bored of the gamegoing against the gritty look of the first game with everything being so damn shiny merc  took away what worked best in what seemed an honest attempt at making an inferior game
gone were the sensible systems of purchases you have to run around to different people to buy what you need we do have phones and the internet heck the people you buy from give you business cards that often have phone numbers which when you need to go to a loading screen to buy things and get missions it detracts
who cares that most of your support strikes are called in by means that leaves you at ground zero you will find most of them are useless as they have a penchant of blowing you up in the processmost annoyingly the vast majority of the game can and should be beaten in a helicopter
no need for about  of the vehicles they lack the mobility or firepower that the higher end attack choppers are loaded with
which brings me to the grapple system and the vehicle boarding system it is frustrating
i know they want to make it more of a challenge so you cant just hijack everything with ease but honestly it is annoying as they didnt even vary the sequences to make things at least a challenge
just memorize the pattern for each vehicle and close your eyes
then the vehicles you have more than likely will disappear when you go to buy stuff or take a mission you cant even put things into this garage that you supposedly havethe game redeems itself in a decent storyline and fantastic graphics but those alone cant make up for a broken game play system
so much of the game was rinse wash and forget where you put the detergent then repeat
id rather play the first game it was at least consistently fun
do yourself a favor and rent the game you will be saving yourself money and the shelf space for a better gameea apparently released this game before it was finished
the graphics really are lastgen and the games has bugs that interfere with completing missions
remember how in the first game you could capture certain wellguarded characters detain and helicopter them out
i was doing one where i couldnt knock the guy down to detain him
i struck him from every direction and he didnt fall
the only thing that worked was shooting him
ive encountered similar problems in other parts of the game
they also seem to have designed this game to attract gta fans  there are missions that involve driving a car to a given destination within a certain time
such missions were not part of the first version of this game and that was fine with me
i liked its straightforward approach
you can have some fun with this game but for what you get this should have been priced  less than it wastheres a very short list of games ive preordered and a very short list of games ive straight up returned only two on each
mercenaries  appears on both of those listsi went out of my way to get mercenaries  for the same reason  out of  people did the freaking commercial
right
come on pretend that song wasnt in your head for days
pretend you didnt love it
oh and mercenaries  was groundbreaking and inovative and brilliant
but mostly it was that song
mercenaries  kicked all sorts of ass even and heavy tone awesome vehicles and vehicle control a wide open map edgy storyline you can literally kill north korean soldiers with no reprecusions
infact its encouraged you get a bounty on their vehicles
edgy stuff man
all i wanted was more of the same
and what did you give me pandemic huh
what did you give me
nonsense fluff story line youre not murder for hire anymore now its revenge
now its personal
 broken gameplay popin is so flawed it makes sniping absolutely useless if you can see them they can see you and theres a lot more of them than you and the constant inane repetitive chatter by every character
what happened to the stark drab engaging and intimidating bombed out korean dmz
now im in a damn sandals resort
but you know what did it
you know what finally made me grab my keys my receipt and truck on down to gametown to give it back and demand the money be transfered to a reserve of fable  instead
im talking with the pirates in the game modern pirates
awesome
edgy
but before i can work with them i have to what
eliminate their enemies
steal oil or drugs
car bomb some dignitaries
no no none of that i just have tobeat them in a boat racea boat race
are you kidding me
why
why are we racing boats with each other
whats next dance off
rap battle
what
why botherhow about help me and ill pay you help me and ill get rid of your enemies help me or ill level your outpost with ordinance from space
how about litterally anything else
in one quest ive gone from lawless warmonger to sonic the freaking hedgehog
it was like they were buying rejected gta san andreas quests from rockstar to meet a deadline on a game they forgot they were making
unreal man unrealbut its not like theres no fun to be had here
theres some good olfashioned runngun
and if the only think you liked about the st mercenaries was blowing stuff up and that is a completely valid reason to like that game  who spent halfanhour placing luxury cars on a bridge before carpet bombing the whole structure just because it was awesome
this guy thats who then you may get a good time out of the sequel
things explode pretty well bad guys shoot at you with many different types of weapons
did i mention ordinance from space
that said if you liked the st mercenaries for any other reason any other reason at all tone characters gameplay etc
youre only going to be dissapointed hereoh no they didnt except yeah they didits depressing when one of your most anticipated game releases leaves you wishing you had bought something else
sixty bucks is a lot of money to wastethe first mercenaries title was  in my opinion  a major milestone
taking the grandtheftauto sandbox design and filling it with military vehicles crazy gun fights and massive explosions
the original game was not without its flaws but i actually think this game has far morethe consoh goodness the graphics
i think a lot of gamers feel that graphics are an aside  as much as graphics are touted by major reviewers publications etc us gamers just dont really seem to care that much
if a game is really really good well look past some frame rate issues and bad aliasing
but mercs   good god  did they port this off of a gameboy
when youre in a race and obstructions literally pop up in front of you around a corner  thats not good
when an enemy is shooting at you from  yards away and yet the engine hasnt actually drawn him yet  thats not good
the colors are extremely flat  trees buildings people  almost all look the sametopography is another issue  many times ive watched my character get killed because i was literally stuck in a rut the depth of a curb
ive also gotten stuck between rocks many many times
it is incredibly frustrating watching an action game turn into a platformer because youre trying to jump out from a few rocksfun  the game just isnt that fun
a lot of strategy has been compromised for action and explosions  neither of which are that good
in the original mercs you could subdue a high value target  referred to in that game as a deck of cards
you could then take your subdued target toss him into a vehicle the hummer h was my favorite and drive out of an enemy base camouflaged as a civilian
this was one of my favorite things to do
so imagine my surprise when i knocked out a hvt in mercs  ran up to my truck and couldnt load the target inside
in the following explosion my hvt was killed and i lost half of my bounty
why did they take that element out of the gamethe air support has become bigger and in some ways better
there are a lot of things you can call in this time and you dont have to worry about keeping a faction happy to keep the supplies rolling in
however you have to stop moving select what you want to call in and throw your beacon for things like artillery support fuel bombs etc
of course most of the time youll catch a rocket in the face for your efforts because youre not moving
why you have to stop to throw an air support beacon is beyond me
this was obviously never betatestedthe story  if you can call it that  is pretty poor
theres no indication as to when missions become available  you literally have to make your rounds among your increasing number of outposts and hq
s and find out what is available to do
the first couple times i found myself thinking now what
only to realize that i had to go talk to someone to find out what was available
i guess its good that fiona  your
boss
keeps nagging you to return home so she can give you suggestionsgood lord the voice acting  i dont know if the same guy did mattias as in the last game but he obviously spent some time hanging out in suck city between projects
he is without a doubt the worse voiceactor ive ever heard
was this guy trying to impersonate shatner
it is literally so bad ive begun skipping the conversations simply because i cant stand itso whats good
the vehicles are okay  i really liked the combat ship i stumbled across  rocket launcher two sidemounted turret guns and a buttkicking frontmounted cannon
the helicopters are more varied and capable  sorta  my favorite part was using a helicopter to drop a gigantic gas tank onto the deck of a large tanker ship  the ship was a target i was asked to destroy
the gas tank landed next to two additional gas tanks on the deck and after a few seconds of bouncing around the first tank exploded igniting the other two
as the ship exploded in a glorious fireball i sat there laughing almost uncontrollably  it was just cool
too bad it took  hours of game play to find a good partwhat else would you like to know
no the physics arent any better
driving is a tiny bit easier but cars slide like youre driving on tefloncoated ice  they stop okay and such but get out of a car while its still just slightly moving and youll walk a halfmile to catch up to it  that is if it doesnt slide off a cliff or beachmercenaries  is its an insult to the engineers who made mercs  such a great game
gone is the flair  no neat animations when you subdue a target
instead we get minutelong tank hijacking sequences
for every item mercs  tried to improve on the original they slacked off on two items that mercs  did great
all in all it makes for a pretty lackluster game
im sorely dissapointedmercenaries  world in flames is a game in flamesthe bugs on the  version are too numerous to list its ridiculous to pay  to beta test products for companies
thus far ive encountered countless lockups corrupted saves clipping issues with video and enemies disappearing into rocks trees and buildings while still being able to shoot at you endless loops for resources that you pickup just leave and come back and viola its respawned invisible boats buildings appearing and disappearing flashing police car lights at random places inability to shop at merchants inability to pickup or even use resources like c and grenades stop outside a building you can enter with a vehicle that is trashed and enterexit the building and viola your vehicle is  buy a vehiclecopter  at the villa save your game after and return to find the vehicle is mia but you still paid for it
these are just the bugs i can think of off the top of my headthe story line seems pointless exact revenge on someone that didnt pay you and shot you in the butt
missions lack variety and are basically the same with few exceptions for each faction
pickup dead or alive x number of high value targets and blow up x number of buildings and take over designated areas to establish bases rince and repeat
many of the glitches will prevent or limit completion of the missions as well
enemy ai is very poor
in many instances you can walk right up undisguised to an enemy without being attacked
when bored with the missions one can accept challenges from the support crew that are made up of silly timed races involving shooting driving or moving objects with a helicoptergraphically in hd the game isnt even last gen never mind next genif you havent played the first mercenaries buy that or any of the other vastly superior sandbox games available before spending your hard earned cash on this
wait for mercs  to hit the bargain bin maybe there will be enough patches and updates by then it will actually be a finished productthis game reminds me of one of those lousy low budget bmovieswhere the cast is unknown and the acting is hideousbut although its a train wreckyou just cant help but laugh at the whole messthat describes raw danger perfectlyeverything about this game sucksbad graphicsbad gameplaybad voice actingjust bad bad bad
buy it to laugh at and nothing morei was very excited to get this game especially so that my friends and i had something to play other than wii sports
we popped the disc and many of the games certainly seemed like fun
unfortunately the game constantly freezes requiring me to restart the wii by holding down the power button the reset button will not work
it always happens either when im choosing an area to go to like rodent way fortune way etc
or when im quitting a game to go back to the area i was in
sometimes there is a loud screeching noise which isnt pleasant on the earsoverall the games are fun to playwhen they work
but the constant freezing means that this game is going back to amazondont expect the next coming of wii sports as the current ratings would lead you to believejust as an example ill compare carnival games skee ball to wii sports bowling
in wii sports the curve of your swing is taken into account to create spin
in carnival games only velocity is measured
in wii sports you can aim diaganolly in addition to left and right
in carnival games you can only move your character left and rightthe experience is pretty shallow youll have a blast at first but not long after
some of the games are so frustratingly bad youll only play them once like the ring tosshowever like the positive reviews correctly point out there are loads of games there are fun things to do with the wiimote and you will have fun playing this game with others
just dont expect the depth of wii sports  which wasnt a deep game to begin withoverall this is a decent game worthy of a pickup from the bargain bin where im sure youll find many copies in a month or twohello i have only the wii system so i will say that firsti bought this game based on reviews here and a few other places
i wanted a game for the family
i felt it was a bit lacking the game ideas were good however the game play was a bit awkward
the motions you had to do for some of them were very awkward and difficult to perform
the real problem i found with the game was that the games themselves were too simplistic and not engaging enough
they were basically actual carnival games like from a real carnival only the wii controller took away that realworld feel it is fun to throw stuff into cups at a carnival but to get your hands into that motion which is at best difficult was tiresomewhile it has points for being multiplayer the games themselves were not terribly satisfying
winning or losing didnt feel much different from each other
the other multiplayer game from wii that was good wii sports which i got with the wii system i think is a good comparison
those games were longer and at the end you could win and feel good about winning and beating the other players
this game felt like you won andsum up not a particuarly good game for the family dissapointingthis is the type of game that would be good to rent bad to buy
it is fun once or twice but past that it does not maintain any interest
i have pulled it out a couple of times for parties but after one game everyone is asking for something else
if you are looking for intense action that fully uses the ui of the wii this is not the game for youi am quite surprised this game has so many good reviews
i bought it recently thinking it would be a big hit with my kids
well i practically have to beg them to even play it at all just to make me feel like i didnt waste  totallywhere to start
the games are not intuitive to play like many wii games
its frustrating to try to toss a ball or dart in a carnival game and not be able to do it without hitting the right buttons
the games are very limited in scopemost have nothing beyond the one simple action to doshoot a duck throw a basketball pop a balloon
once you master that youre pretty bored
there is little incentive to get better
the prizes are basically small pictures of a prize
the biggest prices make some sort of noise and can be turned aroundmajor thrill
i think of things like the trophies in smash brothers which really seem almost like toys you can touch
the games are not tied together with the feel of a real carnivalthey are just reached by signposts of their category and the categories dont make a lot of scene
i thought you would be able to wander around a virtual carnival but no such luck
many of the games features are confusing
for example when we tried to play a two player game it took us forever to figure out how to use two controllers and not just pass one back and forthyou have to turn around a sign to do that and its not well explained
two player mode is pretty much just playing the same game with alternating turns and you get no prizes or tickets in two playerthe main game my kids wanted most to try was the skeeball type one
it was hard to control and not very funin keeping with the rest of the gamei give the game  stars as its an interesting concept and a few games were mildly fun for a whileballoon pop and duck shooting to name them
overall i felt cheated and bored by the game as did my kids
i really wonder why all the reviews are so goodi love the bowling game that comes with wii sports so i was expecting this game to be something like that but with more realistic characters bowling alleys and more control over the ball
the graphics are ok there are several different alleys but the characters which do look real dont move very fluidly
it isnt real sharp either as im accustomed to with other wii gamesthe control over the ball is nothing like in wii sports
in wii sports it feels like youre really bowling
in this game it feels very awkward
it seems like the ball goes in a certain direction no matter what you do
some people have commented that after you play the game a while and build up some time the control gets better but shouldnt it be a game of skill right from the startthe voices get annoying very quickly
i was ready to smack my charater after about  minutes
thank goodness you can turn them off
the characters i used seemed to repeat the same things over and over
it seemed like there should be some more random phrases for a little more varietyi hope there will be other bowling games out there that are more realistic that have the feel and movement of the wii sports version with real looking characters and lots of bowling alley choices
i wish this game would have fulfilled those expectations
if i hadnt played the wii sports version before renting this game i might have been happier with it
but by comparison it didnt measure upthis game seems like it could be a ton of fun considering how much fun wii sports bowling is
however this game is severely lacking
you are not able to play multiplayer using the character you made in career mode
instead you have to choose from  very lame looking characters
in career mode it isnt long into the first week you are scoring a ton of points until you are upgraded with hook control
once your hook control is upgraded it is nearly impossible to control the ball
in week  of practice on career i cant get more than a  wait until the other real bowling comes out for wii and save your moneybelieve me folksjust because this game has the williams name on it doesnt mean it is worth owningthe gameplaygraphics and physics make this game all but unplayablethis is without a doubt the second worst pinball game i have ever played
the first worst being a propinball title that was a topdown view with only the immediate area of the ball being visablethe wii playstation and psp versions of this title have less tables than the xbox version including the classic medieval madness game
it seems unfair to include less games under the same title than on other platforms therefore i cannot recommend this producti am one of the many former live fans live  being one of the best and funnest games of the series but with recent iterations of the game being lackluster i have moved onto to greener pastures also known as the nba k series
so when i saw that live  had made some big improvements over the disaster that was live  i figured why not give it a chance
while this game is significantly better than live  it still isnt that great a basketball sim
certain animations seem to be missing making the game seem not as fluid as you would hope especially from a game running at  frames per second
dunk animations in particular are just not right
guys can go from running or standing still to a dunk in a very quick leap essentially making the shot unblockable
at best when someone dunks its either a foul or a dunk
blocking the dunk is definitely not an option even with some of the best shotblockers in the league
also jumpshot animations really have no rhythm so it does not feel very fluid when shooting a jump shot
watching the game also isnt that fun
the way players move on the floor has a wonky feel to it not like watching a real game
all in all id have to stay skip this live and pick up k
even though k has its flaws one being a terrible roster glitch that screws up all player match ups on defense it is still a far better gameplay experience than live
while i was hoping live would hit its stride next year i think well have to wait for nba live  before this game is relevant againgame not my thingmy advice whenever possible gamers should take advantage of the free game demo downloads available on xbox live before spending the cash for a game that may be lacking
i tried the demo to this game and knew quite quickly that this would not be a game that i would enjoy
i mean seriously if the game makers cant put their titles best foot forward in a short playable demo then the full game is not likely to be good eithersave money for good gamesoverlord is fun alright but only in the beginningwhen you still have fond reminiscences of all the fun times you had playing dungeon keeper
but as you further advance in quests somehow it all gets tedious and tiring
i love the graphics and all but this is mainly for young gamerswhen i first heard of this game i thought wow a non fighting soul calibur game would be great and my son was ecstatic about it being a fan of sc  and  well its not what i expected
you start out as siegfried and you hack and slash your way through level after level fighting the same enemies each level
nothing wrong with hacking and slashing especially with the wii remote
i liked how you control your sword with the controller as you would if you were really in the game
the only problem with it is you are limited to only a few moves
wouldnt it be nice if you could customize your attacks or the sword move the way your controller actually moves
anyway after a few levels of repetitive enemy death you fight a boss of sorts
sometimes the boss will be unique and sometimes it will be a familiar character form the sc series
after these boss battles you will either free a new ally or the guy you just fought will some to his senses and join your team
and thats pretty much it
the big complaints i have is being to limited to what you can do in the game
im more into going through and going my own way through the game
i also hate repetitive enemy battles
mix it up a bit
every other level looks the same in this game
i did however like being able to switch between characters and the controls were ok but like i said earlier it could have been better
overall i feel this game was rushed while in production
no depth limited control and a very boring storylinei never thought i would give a game in the soul calibur series a bad rating but here we are
soul calibur legends is a disappointing game on a number of levels no pun intended and would be purchased only by absolutely diehard soul calibur fans who must have the next gamethe past soul calibur games have been fighting games  innovative games with some of the best gameplay character design extras and graphics anywhere in the video game world
for whatever reason namco decided that for the wii they would ditch all of that and go ahead and create a dynasty warriorstype rdperson action game and forsake all of the fighting game elements
dont get me wrong  i love dynasty warriors and own many of the dw games
this is like dw only in concept not executionsoul calibur legends allows you to play as a number of the characters from previous games and some new ones but the thrill of doing so is gone
the characters dont really have any unique moves of their own the attacks are the same for everyone and the game play is just the same old thing level after level
there is absolutely no challenge to this game at all  attacking utilizes the wii remotes ability to slash and stab but this decreases the fun level of the game even more the controller is none too sensitive so that you really have to try very very very hard to stop doing the same attack over and over
on top of that the little things that made the other sc games so much fun  like a spectacular opening sequence  are missing
the opening sequence of this game looks basically like it was made of animated sketches colored on photoshop
its a shame that nintendo couldnt have insisted on a better gamesoul caliber is a great fighting games series with a very loyal fan base
with soul caliber legends they tried to convert the series into an rpg
rgp fans will probably find it lacking but soul caliber fans will appreciate the new look at their worldfirst the gameplay
in single player  campaign mode you go through a series of minor battles up until you hit a boss like many typical rpgs
you swing the wii remote around like a sword in order to make your attacks
the direction of the swing does matter  for example lefttoright acts differently than righttoleft
you can get a good workout playing this for a whilethat being said the gameplay gets rather repetitive very quickly
there isnt a lot of thought or finesse involved
also the game itself is exceedingly short
you can finish the entire game in one day
with a fighting game you have a lot of incentive to keep playing either alone or with friends but here once the game is over you really dont feel impelled to go back to itnormally in games like these the basic game is simple because the multiplayer is then complex and rich
however soul caliber legends doesnt offer much in this area
there are a few coop a few headtohead and thats about itthe graphics are a real mixed bag
in some cases they are really very lovely and detailed
whoever designed the wood parquet floor should get a gold star
on the other hand some of the items are hideous looking as if they were transplanted from a nintendoi could complain about the tiny bikini outfit that they put the female into but thats an issue with soul caliber as a whole not just with this gamethe sound is equally mixed
sometimes it seems almost good quality  and then at other times the dialogue makes you want to cringe
if this was a fighting game it might not matter much  but in an rpg the whole point is the role playing environment and it raelly stands outweve played a lot of soso games through and this was one we just lost interest in after a while
its not engaging
and we are soul caliber fans so we were the target audience for this game
id suggest this as a game to rent first and then buy if you find you enjoy itrating i am extremely disappointed with all three of these games even the forth one
it may partly have to do with the fact that i played resident evil  on the wii before the ps so of course my outdated system would seem dismal
the games are awkward and hard
the controls are ridiculous and makes the games not very fluid
accessing your weapons is hard especially when you are under the stressful situation of being mauled by a bunch of zombies
the games do not provide nearly enough ammunition that you need and you find yourself kicking and punching zombies more than using your gun
also unlike the wii games where you can shake the remote and free yourself from a zombie thats attacking you have no way to fend yourself once a zombie begins to attack youyou just have to take the damage until someone frees you or the zombie is done attacking
overall i would not recommend these games for the ps
i do however highly recommend resident evil  for the wii and also the multiplayer resident evilumbrella chronicalsi waited a long time for this game to finally be released thinking it was going to be a fantastic game
well it certainly had the potential for being a great game but fell short
the folks that designed the game should really be ashamed at what they put out
very shaky graphicsgraphics you would expect to see on ps or psi was expecting a really serious military game with a killer plotstory awesome graphics etccomplete bummer of a gamei had high hopes for this game based simply on some screen shots i had seen
the game however didnt live up to expectations
the first problem with this game is it just doesnt know what it wants to be
it tries to blend stealth tactics with runngun tactics and fails on both counts miserablythe story is very poor and almost nonexistent
you are basically behind enemy lines disobeying orders while blowing up the things of the enemy
it just exists to give you a reason to blow things up and kill people is what im sayingthe game is dated but the graphics werent too shabby
in fact thats the only thing saving it from the dreaded one star ratingand then theres the sound
not bad but not great it could swing passing marks but only just barely
the main charactervoiced by mickey rourke is the worst
his old man gravely voice doesnt fit the character at alllastly and perhaps most importantly is the amount of profanity in this game
i dont mind cussing in fact it adds a touch of realism but this was just over the top and had no purpose other than for the sake of dropping the fbomb
not one sentence is used in this game by the main character that doesnt contain at least  cuss words
no jokeoverall the game is a stinker
its playable but not an enjoyable experience
if you must try this game for whatever reason i would suggest buying it used or just renting it
either way i am willing to bet you will regret spending whatever money it was you spent on itwhen i first grabbed this i was expecting a call of dutysplinter cell mix a combo of stealth and fps combat
what came out was a painfully linear fps that tries in vain to be a stealth shooter
following the supposed exploits of the founder of seal team  youre dropped into north korea to obtain information on a missile program being run by the dprk
after your team is wiped out you carry on by attempting to depopulate a small city with your knife and silenced pistolgraphics are barely tolerable
while the motif is captured nicely and the ongoing day makes it almost feel like an episode of  so little was attempted with regards to graphics which still manage to have a plethora of clipping issues and poor lighting effects
detail is also substandard and should have been a crown jewel given how small scope the levels areaudio is a combination of swears slamming the officer corps and whining about whos snafu the current issue is caused by
while this doggerel could have been saved by some switch up in tone or direction i never came across onegameplay is boiled down to stealth kill as many as you can then do cover to cover combat to kill everyone else
the stealth aspect is awful and your radar makes little if no sense for being essentially a soliton from metal gear
theres little else to mention apart from vulturing every thing the enemies dropoverall this was a colossal let down
had it had more of a mission to mission feel it probably wouldve turned out okay but they apparently wanted a main character who spits nails and bleeds raw masculinity
even this wouldnt have completely butchered the game if they hadnt made the character one dimensional to the point that you wouldnt be surprised if all of his lines devolved into thog smash stinky gooks
multiplayer is also a vestigal failure with abysmal setup uninteresting maps and the classic problem of trying to find people who know the map better than youhad a lot of hype for this game but was let down by the length
it took me and hour and a half to beat the whole game
awesome game with brutal takedowns but it cannot compete with modern shooters like cod mw
multiplayer is a nightmare because no one plays it
i would buy this game again if it is like  because it was fun for a while but just too shorttellurye here with another review
this time looking at rogue warriorstory  you are demo dick marcinko navy seal dropped in the middle of the night in korea to investigate ballistic missile dealings between them and russia
his name fits his personality as after a molecausing ambush you forge ahead anyway on a mission of revenge killing everything that moves in hunt for the traitor who gave up your positiongameplay  oh my
did they finish this game
the mechanics are ok nothing that hasnt been done better by even the older games out there
standard first person shooter that gets boring pretty fast
the locales change but with horribly easy ai and no need to plan ahead folks are blowing through this game in under  hours
one thing that stands out are the quick kill moves
ole dick is a bad mo fo when it comes to hand to hand take downs
its a mixture of stealth and action but like i said the ai will either be completely oblivious as you stand there and curse out loud right next to them or they see you a mile away and take cover  forcing you to go guns blazing
cover mechanics does put you in third person but does not really absorb the player into the experience
it might as well be called camera view togglinggraphics  game does look pretty detailed and lots of neat locales
then again sometimes you will run into a weird model here or there like they just wanted to use a triangle to simulate a bolder
engine is not too bad but not jaw dropping visuals by any stretch of the imagination
pretty pleasing to the eyes
that andaudio is really what made this game playable
it looks fun and mickey rourke lends his voice for dick and does a great job
the writingyeah not so much
way too much profanity and they are programmed so horribly that it triggers in the dumbest of places
you are supposed to be stealthy but after snapping someones neck he stands there cursing and calling them names for about an hour
hello who are you talking to
good thing the ai is dumb otherwise you would so break stealth
then other times  guys are gunning for you and mickey will say oh  quietly to himself
that is when you should be swearing up a storm
not mickeys fault its the programmersoverall  dont get me wrong this game is a blast to play though but with no one playing multiplayer which is so buggy and broken its not even worth mentioning i would so wait until this puppy goes down to 
dont even waste coupons or a christmas wish on it
the fact that its only  weeks old and already  is proof there
you have killer take downs fun locales neat achievements and decent graphics  but multiplayer is broken the ai is useless story makes no sense and a script that ruins the mood with gameplay over in a couple hours
pretty much bargain bin ready
good news is you can rent it and return it fast which is what youll do anyway is there is no reason to visit this again  unless you want to dance to mickeys rap at the end creditsi just rented and beat this game
its worth a rental but not worth buying until it is very cheap
the graphics look like a game that came out  or  years ago
and you can beat it in about  hours or less
this game is fun to play and can be played more than once with getting sick of it
it has some easy  achievments but dont expect to get all  easy
i would give this game a 
just remember not every game can be a  i dont think it has coop which it should have to make it funner
but it really wouldnt be rogue warrior with two people playing
it does feel like something is missing
there are no items laying around to pick up which would have lengthened the game
no money cards gun parts dog tags pieces of paper etcthis is what it says i guess
you play for a few minutes each dayhowever after a few minutes of playing you are done
i thought there would be more to it than there was
dissappointed but my  year daughter loves it
i would not recommend to friends my agewow am i disappointed
after my accident i suffered from a form of amnesia that left me with only small memories of my childhood
i bought this so i can work on getting my brain back into shape
when i say a disappointment i meant it
first of all you must know how to play paper rock scissors i do not know that game i am from brooklyn i recall something like eenie meaniewell since  i do not know how to play that game to get me brain age i had to cheat
i wrote down what the game is and copy it
then the games or assignments are the same thing over and overi have them memorized it does not take a rocket scientist to see that the jumble words always start with crew then flash etc
they are always the same
how do  you learn something if that something never changesthe guy is a pain in the neck every time you start a game over you have to go passed all the pages of his nonsense before you can start to play again and he is so cheesy
what do these people think we are children
sudoku another annoyance you can only make four mistakes come on now on the fifth mistake you are cut off from the gamehow many people go to the end  without making mistakes
what i am really upset about is that i ordered both of them but number  came first i am afraid that number  is just as bad and i wasted all that money on garbage
anything that makes you repeat the same thing over and over is not going to improve your memory of that game
you need to have different triggers so your brain is challenged not the same things so you memorize them
i have not even touched on the fact that the game does not recognize your writing
i have written perfect letters and have been buzzed
i do not recommend this game do crosswords  if you want to improve your mind
this is a big waste of good money
i truly do not see how anyone can give it a  stari just finished blue dragon after putting about  hours in
i thought based on the great reviews that id be in for a treat
i was quite disappointed
heres my quick summationgeneral take this game is for kids
end of storyprosthe general gameplay is easy and the storyline is easy to follow so if you want a mindless game you should play itthe shadow system is creative but also inherently flawedconsthis game has the worst voice dub i have ever seen
the characters are totally emotionless and there are tons of these super awkward pauses between dialoguethe bosses were always x harder than the standard monsters at that point in the game
you kill a monster in one hit and the boss takes  of your life off in one hit
get some consistency
bosses should be hard but they shouldnt crush you so easilythe shadow system is stupid too everyone of your characters can essentially have the exact same skillset by the end of the game
theres no point in specializingleveling your characters is almost a complete waste of time
you can beat the game at level  if you just use field barrier to let your characters shadows level up overnight and max  or  classesall in all im glad i bought it used
i wouldnt say it was the worst game ive ever played but it is certainly nowhere near one of the best gamesi wasnt sure what to expect from this game but it came with the system for free so i decided to try it outfirst the good
the battle system is actually kind of fun
there are some decent bosses and enemies that require some different strategies to take care of
there are some decent customization options for your characters
thats pretty much it for the goodthe bad  where to start
well lets start at the beginning
the opening scene is just awful and as soon as this game starts you will dislike the main characters immensely
really the landshark just stop game
every character in this game aside from maybe kluke is just down right awful
shu is annoying hell let you know many times throughout the course of the game that he wont give up
 as is jiro who is my new personal favorite word to call someone who fails at being a hero since he fails hardcore in this game while trying to save kluke
then they introduce marumaro later on and made me want to kill myself
this thing is my least favorite character of any game ever made
i dont just dislike him i hate him
not only is he just a bad overall character but it sounds like they got a  year old to do his voice acting
this wouldnt be horrible in of itself but he talks a lot and every line he says he screams annoyingly loud
you cant choose to mute him as he randomly pops in during conversations with his screeching
it got to the point where i would yell at the screen anytime he would talk because he is that obnoxious
i wish they had given me the ability in this game to go through his village that you visit and slaughter every last one of his people
what doesnt make any sense though is that the other characters actually like this freak which makes me dislike them all the more
i feel bad later on for kluke when shu and jiro try to woo her
it must be pretty awful knowing these are the only two losers that want you
zola isnt too bad but then you find out she enjoys hanging out with marumaro and you dislike her too
then theres the bad guy nene and his stupid pet
theyre both pretty awful as is his terrible planstory  id describe it but then id be giving out spoilers as most of it is the terribly designed plot of the main bad guy
its pretty awful lets leave it at thatmusic  theres nothing really good or bad about the music
there is one interesting part though
the first time you fight a boss battle and you hear the music start playing youll be like what the heck is this
this plays for every boss battle along the way with the exception of maybe  or so
you will remember this song for the rest of your life
the first time or two you hear it it might annoy you
once you hit the third or fourth time youll actually find it catchy
link included if you want to listen to it
battle animations  this is a huge annoyance
i dont know when rpgs decided that i enjoy watching my characters or the enemies take  seconds to do something but i really hate it
this isnt every enemy in this game but there are a few
the worst offenders are some fire creatures dont remember what theyre calledaround the midpoint
they take about  seconds to do their attack
i ran into a group of  or  of them and they got the first strike
i literally sat there for almost  minutes watching them dance around prior to their attacks before i finally got to do something
this one regular battle took me more then  minutes to finishsearching through town  this gets its own topic because its vastly annoying
almost every object in this game can be searched in towns or dungeons to attempt to find treasure money exp a stat boost item which youll find often
the problem is that every time you search something the game does a  second animation of your character searching through the object
this wouldnt be a huge problem but there are well over a thousand things you can search throughout the game
the worst is when theres nothing in the object and you still have to watch the search animation and then it just says nothing when its done
why would you do this
why make such a huge time wasting animation
itll often take you around a minute to clear a small room
you dont have to do any of this if you dont want to but later on there is a character you talk to who gives you decent rewards based on the number of nothing objects youve searched
if youve been searching throughout the game this will be a very high numberdifficulty  the game is relatively easy
i didnt die once throughout the course of the main game
you will also get a huge number of random items throughout the course of the game that you will never find a time to actually useoverall  i finished the game but its a chore to do so more often then it is fun
there are way better rpgs out there with way better characters story game play and difficulty
dont bother with thisif you are old enough to be thoroughly considering your options in what game to purchase next then you are likely old enough to start having more mature tastes by now
a choppy framerate and a shallow and derisive story cannot be saved by the uncommonly good musical score
try instead lost odyssey which is an extremely solid choice for those who feel a need to scratch that turnbased rpg itch on the xbox  and a much better value for your time and moneypros character customization is great
im a sucker for job systemscons the characters are the worst characters out of any creative work ever made
seriously they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever
i was literally cringing during almost every cutscene the plot is utter trash
its just a really dumb and basic story the battles are way way way too easy the achievements attached to the game are ridiculousim glad i got this for an incredibly cheap price because i would feel very ripped off otherwisevastly inferior to the hbp game
tough to even move or inspect anything with ron and hermione constantly in the way
constant nagging to complete the current task makes the mute button your best friend
only the gobstone and wizard chess games are truly funharry potter and the order of the phoenix for the wii is in my opinion a very bad game
the bad parts of this game are that the view is annoying and random it skips over major parts of the story teleports you at random points for example i was in occlumency class and then less than a second later without any explanation in the order of the phoenix headquarters at christmas has hardly any action no puzzles and is made up mostly of running around hogwarts collecting students for this or that
the students who you are supposed to collect can never come with you until you do some stupid task for them
the good parts are that the wii motions usually work and when they do work it feels a lot like you are actually holding a wand the graphics are amazing for the wii and hogwarts is gigantic and thoroughly detailed
all of those pros have a bad side to them though
when the wii motions dont work it is really annoying the graphics are only good from far away when you look at closeups things look really weird and because hogwarts is so big it makes the tasks insanely hard because you often need to go across the whole entire building looking for things or just getting something across the building
theres good music but for some reason it usually isnt playing
every word is voiceacted which is a good thing but theres so much unneeded and random talking in the game that the voices get really annoying
there are a bunch of unlockables but no real reason to get them
you get videos and stuff when you find enough hidden stuff but theyre sort of boringoverall the only really good thing in this game is the amazing recreation of hogwarts
if the price goes down somewhere around  this game might be worth thinking about just so you can explore hogwarts but at any other price it just isnt worth itthis game struck me as a minigame something that could have been included on the orange box along with team fortress  and portal
no idea how they thought  was an appropriate price for this
there is such a lack of depth here that it is almost insulting how much marketing and advertising went into the releasefirst there are only four levels
yep just four
they arent very long either
the whole point is to run to the other end of the map and shoot a bunch of zombies along the way
its fun sure but it has a shelf life
playing through with three of your friends is also fun but only for a limited number of times
after this wears thin you say to yourself well lets take this online and pwn some nbz
right
wrong
that gets boring super fast as well
maybe its because there are only  maps for online play as well and they are the same maps as offline mode
on top of that there is just one gameplay mode for online
that mode is surprise run to the end of the map and shoot zombies along the way
the only difference is that online you play as the zombies half the time and the humans the other half
thats a neat concept too and fun for a bit but gets boring after a few run throughs especially since the zombies have a twenty second spawn timeso you are probably asking what about the other good stuff
cool guns
cool zombies
well there are some ok guns and some ok zombies but its the same thing every level same zombies every level same everything every level
nothing ever changes despite what all the advertising tells you
this groundbreaking ai only means the boomer zombie spawns around this corner instead of that other corner he spawned from last time
there is no super cool ai that makes the zombies do cool stuff
they just run at you and try to eat you
not a lot of range that can be achieved within those parameters anyway so i wonder why they made such a big deal about it in the ads
probably because the game has such little to offer in total
anyway you start off every level with a couple of gun choices then halfway through you get a couple other gun choices
by choices i mean pick one gun to shoot zombies with and only one
you cant carry more than one at a time
the whole thing is just repetitive and gets real old real fastoverall i just kept thinking really
they consider this a full game
its honestly about  hours of fun and that is a rip off for a full priced game with online play
ive clocked nearly  hours on call of duty  and still arent totally sick of it
i got bored of this on the first day
its a colossal fraud to sell this game as anything more than a good idea with no game wrapped around ittry before you buy
dont just read the hypefirst let me say that i have the xbox game of the year edition i have downloaded everything i could find for the game from xbox live and i have played the game a several times solo and with split screen playerwhether or not you will like this game depends on the style of play you like in your games
some people might like this type of play but i didnt
ive enjoyed playing everything from the evil dead games and dead rising to resident evil    and a bunch of other zombie type games
the issue i have is that left  dead doesnt play like how it feels like it should play  or it feels one way but plays another way
left  dead feels like it should play like a tight strategy game of team tactics and smart game play  hardcore zombie apocalypse survivors the smart  the dead  but it isnt it just isnt
ill get back to the game play in a minutea lot of the game looks ok at first maybe good but nothing great
the graphics breakdown badly when you are getting stomped on by zeds any time you are on the ground or when zeds are too close to you and when you get dragged by smoker zeds it gets really glitchy
and the fire effect ie
from molotov cocktails is awful
but for as flawed as some of these things are i wouldnt necessarily say that they detract too much from the game playthe areasmaps arent very open there is a definite tunnel feel to the game
which given the nature of the objectives is probably unavoidable
yet some of the tight tunnel areas like the ones that are outside do provide an illusion of openness which is nice
but what this all means is that game play is relatively linear the route to a destination is pretty tight and your style of game play will be pretty much forced upon you
so all that turnoffyourlights and sneakaroundthewitch dialogue is garbage  shes either in your way or she isnt  anyhow you just shoot her either wayand now speaking of that game play its just an ammoburner game
you have limited ammo for your special weapon of choice shotgun assault rifle uzi whatever but unlimited ammo for your pistols  and you go through a lot of it really fast
forget about swat
play forget about being a ninja forget about sniping to clear a path ahead just forget about stealth and efficiencyyou shoot you run and shoot and you shoot and run some more
lingering around areas being cautious and thorough will only get you more encounters with randomly generated zeds
there is not a general fixed number of zeds in an area the game will spawn more zeds craploads more when conditions are triggered
this is a game of whatever like get from point a to point b or stand on a rooftoplighthouse that is punctuated by random special zed appearances and waves of rushing zed hoards
pointless wave after random wave of rushing zed hoards
a runngun or a standngunso the best tactic is to just run through an area until you hit a special zed or a good vantage point and then turn around and deal with everything in a hail of blazing lead or a pipe bomb  theyre magical zed magnets
seriously it works best that way youll save ammo and time and deal with less crap
because when you trigger a zed rush they will spawn and come running at you from all directions from the empty rooms you just swept clear from the deadend halls you just swept clear from anywhere and everywhere they will magically appear to come charging at you
so forget your specops mentality its pointless
and there is no meaningful stealth action
so just forget about intelligent game play unless your idea of strategy is to back yourself into a closet and fire outwards
dont just listen to the masses of circlejerk fanbois
i find this game about as tactical as the video game gauntletnow maybe everything i have complaints about is just the way the game is supposed to be
maybe im whining about woulda shoulda coulda and crying about stuff that i want to have that just shouldnt be a part of the game
i keep wondering about that myself
but then the heavyhanded teamwork elements keep running up to me and smacking me in the facethis is a total buddy system game
you arent going to get anywhere without someone else there to pick you upoff the ground
it is forced upon you through the games mechanics
there is no running ahead and going solo because everyone else is cramping your style
this is a game about teamwork team tactics teammate support and assists
it is a key element in the game  there are several achievements based off of this
its good and its bad im still on the fence about how i feel about it
in some ways i do like it and in other ways i think it totally hamstrings game playyou are the ive fallen and i cant get up
lady
if you are grabbed you are helpless until someone else assists you
if you are on the ground no matter how much health you have you are stuck on the ground until someone assists you
if your whole team gets knocked down no matter how much health everyone has or how many health packs everyone has it is game over because no one is left standing to assist anyone else back up
and survivors will get knockeddown and draggedaround and probably bitten and mauled a lotwith this sort of forced and required teamplay element the game feels like it should be more at a level of socom call of duty ghost recon halo or even splinter cell or tenchu demanding a higher level of tactical style and strategic cover your and your teammates butts type of game play  but its not
its a sloppy triggerhappy firefest
this is not a game of clean shots and efficient kills there is no go ahead ive got you covered stuff specops style tactics or any thoughtful or cautious efforts just dont have any credit herefast zombies or slow zombies infected or undead i dont really have a preference but i thought the special zombie types in this game were kinda lame
pukerexploder fat thing stereotype
roidrage tank stereotype thing
leaperpouncer zed
snipertongue smokeexploding 
zed
i just want to cry and i hate the light emo witch zed
i just dont think any of them are really cool or inspiring
really stupid stereotype concepts better suited to alien creatures like the flood in halo than zombiesi can only rate this game a  or  stars
the only recommendation i can make is try before you buy
dont just read the hypeoverhyped game
period
game play is repetitive have only about  different types of zombies about  different guns and graphics that really are subpar
the strong side ld does have is multiplayer but compared to other juggernauts like call of duty  ld is laughable in comparison
then again maybe im just not a zombie fani agree with everything that another reviewer said this game is mindless shooting with no real objective or mission
its just composed of a number of different missions that can be played in any order without a sense of achievement
left  dead is basically composed of one horde of zombies after anotherthats itonline mode is boring i think
the infected characters are extremely overpowered by the ammunition that the noninfected carry
plus you have to rotate between the characters youre the infected in the first round noninfected in the next
its just the same thing over and over
you should have the ability to stay on one of the teams for more than one round
if i want to play as an infected character the entire time i should be able toi give the game a  overall because it allows for  players on the same console to play together
how sad is it that having  local players is considered a treat
if you enjoy mindless shooting of endless hordes of zombies this game is for you
if you enjoy games that deliver stories and tell you why youre doing what youre doing or why youre in the situation you are you might want to rent this before purchasingi like this game but it is far too short
the plus for me is the obvious
you can play with your friends or strangers online
which makes for interesting gameplay
i just wish it had more playability solo wisethe professional reviewers rave about this game game informer gave it a 
playing it i was reminded reviewers dont actually pay for games
be aware the game will cost you more than the  valve want for the disc
this game is really designed for multiplayer
however unlike pc and wii games multiplayer will cost you extra month or year xla gold
want to play as the zombies
that will cost extra xla gold
the game only comes with  maps only  of which can be played in online vs mode
so you want more maps
that will cost you extra dlc price tbdon to the game itselfthis is a  game so its competing against games like fallout  fable ii re gears of war ii etcpros audio and dialog are good fun to read graffiti atmosphereenvironment descent enemy ai fits zombie well mog modes fun for a whilecons graphics are average to below average all  characters play exactly the same the ai is poor and frustrating cant use pipe bombs cant make many jumps wont follow to take cover in rooms only  short maps im not a hardcore gamer and i finished all  maps in less than  hours on normal difficulty mapspaths are linear though some itemsenemies spawn randomly not a lot of reply value cant use scope on scoped rifle only  types of enemies two of which are rare witch tank
so most of the game involves fighting fodder zombies plus only  special types
it gets boring pretty quickly
this really feels more like a  game  especially if the additional maps end up being  like most xla dlc and with the xla gold membership requirement for mog play
single player is so short and theres little replay value  maybe each map twice
valve nickleanddiming buyers doesnt help
ill be wary of their games in the future
if valve is saying at  this game holds its own against fallout  or gow i think theyre wrongthe charm in left  dead is duking it out with the zombie hoard with two or three friends of yours whether its locally or online
get through the campaign with teamwork shoot reload run repeat
cover certain spots strategically in the different game modes or switch it up with some of you as monsters and some of you as heroes
but thats where the fun ends
when youve made it through the campaign had a few gaming nights with buddies and done a few special challenges theres not much more to this game
its fun while it lasts but now it just sits on my shelf because playing it in single player just isnt the same thing and everyone knows how the campaign plays out by now
in a way i sort of regret buying it  it wouldve been enough to borrow it from a friend when its game night but personally i dont feel compelled for more left  dead when the charm wears off its just a onetrack game with heavy focus on teamworkim tired of the whole infected zombiehuman franchise will it ever end
this game is nothing more than who can kill the most zombies yay
how creative
shoot kill hordes chase you kill shoot more hordes yay
btw lets list the movies dawn of the dead day of the dead  days later  weeks later quarantine i am legendinfected humans same thing and the list goes on
but this review is about the game its just boring and losing its taste after about ten minutes
the pc version looks and plays much better even if i do hate it
the graphics are solid valve looking cities apartments streets etc
only reason i gave it two stars is for that reason
other than that if you want some real fun play the resident evils at least they have depth and story and are very fun and challenging to play
dthe following things can be found in the game fractured limitless spawning enemies that are either completely mindless or expert marksmen some will run right by you firing into the distance others will hit you from what seems like a mile away
a pretty stupid gadget that allows you to lift or lower dirt
thats right you are armed with a remote dirtmover
subpar graphics
a clunky control scheme
ultimately a frustrating and rather boring game that probably wont keep your attention for very long
id say i got a deal since i only paid about  for this game but in retrospect its  id really like back
this game is rubbish
its not the absolute worst game ive ever played but id probably put it in the top  worst
save your money and avoid this turdsega pulled a fast one on the new consoles with this onebesides having more room to run around and better graphics segas the club is just outtrigger that came out on the dreamcast in 
gameplay is the same the view is the same heck the objective is even the same
a few minor changes and a few addittions and there you have it
a decent quick revised run  gun game for a quick  bucks
the club probably got a lot of game fans for their money but this game should only be  and no more
if you want the club for  bucks then save your  bucks and hunt down a dreamcast and the outtrigger game
more than likely can get the system and game for the same price or cheaper
overall i think the club is a fun game with nice graphics but yet falls short on dept and replay value
once you beat the game with all the characters theres really no other reason to play unless youre playing againest a live person instead of ai
in a deathmatchalternate history is supposed to be filled to bursting with epic battles creative plot twists and above all a deep understating of the historical events this genre so gleefully twists
youll find none of those elements in this bland shooterthe decidedly unepic story begins with the roar of nazi bombers over new york
we are introduced to the main character dan carson as he attempts to escape the ravages of the attack while suddenly developing master chief level combat skills
dan must have had some seriously repressed anger issues because he shows no remorse over the fact that hes made a complete aboutface from being a construction worker to a killer
thats little consequence because the rest of the plot is just as much of a messthe graphics are just sad
for using the same engine that powered the excellent gears of war turning point is an ugly game
the flat textures and blocky world design only serve to aggrevate the problem of lousy ai
for soldeirs of the most well trained army of that day the nazi soldiers have the selfpreservation instincts of suicidal squirrels and the lousy hit detection to match
the enimies you face are either sloppy soldiers or the result of ai
recycled from the original doom
who was programming this gamein conclusion no matter how much you enjoy alternate history dont bother with this flop
it had so much potential but does everything from the genre tropes to the fundamental game design wrong
maybe theres an alternate history where this game was actually funi was not happy with the story
the game was hard to play and i got stuck too many times
almost not worth ityou play as carson dailyermi mean just carson
he is a construction worker from new york during an alternateearlys era where the nazis have conquered europe and ww is still raging on
one day youre on some steel gerders and boom
the nazis begin attacking the united states
you regroup withthe national guard
and its up to you and your resistance group to stop the nazi invasionyoull travel the east coast of the united states to repel the attack
youll start off in a decent replica of new york and at one point will see the chrysler building ripped in half and laying in the street washington dc to save some fictional resistance general from execution and the constitution from being burned which is an achievement in the new york subway system and a few other areas
the environments look for the most part pretty goodthe action is pretty intense and you can do these grapple moves where you run up and either use the nazi as a human shield for a little bit or you beat the bajesus out of them in different ways
however turning point is a very buggy and glitchy game so the icon to indicate you can grapple the people sometimes does not show up until you are on the verge of death
you can run up and press the b button numerous times until you actually do grab the person
you get a bunch of modified ww weapons such as the new mp gewher  theres a new vampir version that has thermal vision for oyu to snipe with the m garand the version of the thompson with the drum on the bottom of the barrel the combat shotgun a multibarreled panzershrek and the potato masher hand grenadesagain this game is really glitchy
for instance theres this stage you go into near the end of the gameits a bridge
you walk out and theres enemies on every side of youthey can actually hit you through the wholes in the bridge but you cant shoot them
sometimes youll go to aim down your iron sights only to find you cant shoot or get out of the aim mode for a couple of seconds to a minute
sometimes your grenades wont explode or sometimes an enemy can hit you from a mile away with the shotguna lot of time the game will freeze up the frame rates will drop and finally the sound will cut out sometimesthe ai is pretty bad too
sometimes you can run right into view and sit there for about  minutes before they take cover and start shooting
its pretty embarrassing for codemasters to have released such a terrible ai system upon the worldthe music is pretty good though
its mainly an orchestrated score to help you feel heart wretched or pumped up
additionally some power sets like the chrysler building being destroyed will push any new yorker like me over the edge and want to finish the gamethe ending was somewhat believable
you board this nazi zeppelin that has a nuke on it and you must disarm it before it blows up i think new york
anyway you kill everyone on the aircraft and reach the nuke
you take one look and notice you have  seconds left and you attempt to stop it
the whole time your commander is telling you good job and what not but your character does not know how to stop a nuclear device
so he sits down shakes his head and the nuke blows up in the sky
your a casualty of war but you stopped the missle from actually being launched at a targetoverall turning point fall of liberty could have been so much better if codemasters would have taken more time to work the bugs out and make the gun power more balanced
on a scale of  i give it a rent it first the good neat grapple system shimming across ledges is new a few new guns different story than usualthe bad glitchy bogged down framerate unbalanced difficulty as straight forward as wwii shooters get lame multiplayer extremely shorti thought turning point was going to rethink wwii shooters after playing the demo but i was wrong
instead we got a headache induced glitchy uneven and unbalanced mess
the games graphics are hardly nextgen with constant texture popup framerate dropping in the single digits and jerky animations
the games difficulty is widely unbalanced even on easy and the achievements are hardly a choreinstead of being a onemanarmy in the military you are a onemanarmy civilian who gets caught up in wwii but the game has a twist
making up characters and creating an original story well trying it makes things more interesting
all your wwii weapons are here plus some weve never seen like the mp
the game has a grapple system where you can use the nazis as human shields kill them instantly or use environmental kills
while this is fun and new it doesnt really change the game play melee kills were just fine before
you can shimmy across poles maybe a handful of times through the whole game and this also isnt very exciting
bottom line is tpfol is a wwii shooter that was released during its testing stages
everyone should pass on this game even wwii or cod buffs because its not worth the riderecently one of those brick and mortar shops had a sale on turning point where i purchased it for what a waste of 
id have been better served buying anything else
maybe a cd with  song i want to hear
id have certainly had more fun with thathit detection is extremely poor in this game
when i shoot an enemy  times and they are still sitting there shooting at me i get annoyed
there are also spots where you can clearly see an enemy in the distance but despite aiming at his head and pulling the trigger on his head he wont die simply because the game hasnt decided this character is active
as soon as the enemy is active then you can kill them
annoyingwhy does the game need to be so dark
i had to turn gamma correction up all the way in the video options in order to be able to see many of the enemiesone thing i cant stand in a game is when enemies pop into the game
i understand wanting to keep the  working on other tasks to give me a tight frame rate and split second controller response but why do i need to suspend my disbelief enough to allow enemies to pop up right in front of me
i shouldnt have to disconnect myself from the action to accept pop up as this then destroys any immersion you might have in the game
and how about having enemies appear behind me when they clearly had no ingress into the area behind me
perfect example
the most annoying section of the game running the catwalk onto the blimp you have come up an elevator to the catwalk
when you leave the elevator which you cant go back down there are several rooms to clear
i went into every room killed every enemy and then ran down the catwalk
at about the  mark of the catwalk i have enemies pop up behind me when clearly they cant be there if you look at the environment
ive watched them pop inlet us now look at the use function when it comes to certain items in the environment
sometimes you have to pull a lever or open a door
for whatever reason the programmers have decided on very narrow or very broad hit detection for this
some doors you can open from yards away
some levers you have to have the lever just to the left of your character to pull
then there is the close combat actions
sometimes you will run up on an enemy and the hand icon appears
sometimes youll be on the same spot of another enemy and instead of the hand appearing youre filled with lead as you try to find the  centimeter area the programmers decided you need to hit this one enemy on
consistency is the key and unfortunately this game fails miserably therethe game is not fun
at all
it is tedious and boringanother way the programmers have decided to make the game difficult is to change the accuracy and the damage enemies do as you progress further into the game
this is fine if it didnt also mean it took only  shots to have you meeting your maker on the later levels where everyone seems to have a gun capable of shooting off  rounds a secondthe only other way they could figure out how to make the game difficult is to add the above accuracy and damage then also make the areas between check points longer and longer the further you get into the game
and some of the areas are controller throwing anger inducing that youll spend hours replaying because despite the fact that the areas are tough as nails and you can easily make your way through them after all the repeat runs theres always an unexpected enemy popping up just before a check point that will shoot you three times with a  bullet per second gun and you dieif youre looking for  easy assuming you are good at the game and can stomach it long enough to play through gamer points this is a good title to pick up for  any more than this and youre being ripped off
and the  can be achieved without playing onlinethe concept behind the game intrigued me as it has others
unfortunately the throw away any interest in this when it turns into a simple poorly done first person shooter with little to no story and nothing really keeping the action cohesiveso is this the worst game ever
no
there are moments of fun to be had
is it the worst game ive played in a long time
yes
usually my goodbad game radar is pretty good
my bad radar was blipping when i picked this up but the  price point muted any protestation my radar may have had
every once in awhile i need to have a kick in the pants to remind me not to ignore the radarturning point fall of liberty reminded me on many levels of the venerable xbox title freedom fighters
at least it reminded me of it while i was reading the box at gamestopfreedom fighters was an excellent game
i still play it now and then when i hook up my xbox
turning point unfortunately is not an excellent gameit does get points for being generally fun to play
not amazing to play but fun
shooting nazis never does get old
this is a rental game id say
if you rent it for a couple of days youll have just enough fun to justify the five or so bucks you spent
if you pay full price on the other hand prepare yourself for severe buyers remorse pangsmy first warning that i was getting a halfbaked product was in the opening video
it was stiff disjointed lacked any music and seemed to cut itself off in midstride
worse it failed to do anything more than serve as a second exposition
nazis are invading
oh the humanity
new york is under attack
thats about itthere is no real story
well there is but you never feel invested in it
the lackluster halfhearted videos between levels that are supposed to drive the story onward serve as little more than fluffy filler lacking pretty much any sense of timing and drama
apparently youre a regular joe named carson who is a highrise riveter in new yorkwait just a second
i have to interject something
what is it about games movies and books all being set in new york
and why do we have to see the same landmarks every time
are there no other cities on the east coast where we could set a game
cmon throw in boston or baltimore or something
anything
im sick to death of new york city being the setting of  of games set in contemporary timesok now we can get back on track
the setup goes like this as this is an alternate timeline winston churchill did not survive to lead england during wwii
britain falls and the axis is victorious in europe
now a few years later they never say but it couldnt be later than  or  thats actually a pretty decent settinglots of potential
lots and lots of wasted potential actually
so youre carson a regular civilian and youre fighting for your life against the nazi invaders who are falling like snowflakes out of the sky all over new yorkthe first level scored points with me because of its frenetic pace and heartpumping explosions
then i got my first weaponthe mp an upgraded mp and went to work
once i hit combat the negatives in this game really started to stick outto keep things simple heres a nice bullet list of the things that frustrated me about the titleapparently helmets want nothing to do with corpses
shoot an enemy in the leg and his helmet will take off and fly across the room
this happens to every enemy with a helmet
admittedly its handy to know when theyre really dead and not just crouching but its a headscratcher
why do the helmets spontaneously animatethe enemies will be in the same place every time you play through so mastery of this game is little more than trial and error learning where the big threats are
i had thought wed moved past this kind of predictabilityfor a while i thought some nazis hated each other because they would shoot at one another
then i realized that they werent
they were all shooting at me but for some reason some nazis stand facing away from me while attacking
others fire their rifles off into the sky for no apparent reason
these bullets do hit you somehow no matter where the enemy seems to be aiming
they must be magicalsometimes enemies will be standing right next to a grenade youve thrown and not die when it explodesnazis appear
for instance you can clear a room move on to the next one clear it andboom youre dead
how
well a nazi materialized in the room youd just left and shot you in the back with a combat shotgun
where did he come from
no one knows
maybe through a vent in the ceiling or somethingbodies vanish
this is something else i thought we had moved pastdespite being a member of the resistance as the game tells you it would be far more accurate to say that you are the resistance
your allies do show up from time to time but they are always waxed in short order and youre back to a solo show
they dont do much in the way of help anyway
its pretty much all on youcarson the main character wears his construction clothes throughout the entire campaign
what he couldnt find anything more appropriate for combat than jeans and a bright orange shirt that practically screams here i am shoot me now
oh and carsons weapons are so hightech that they become invisible when you climb a ladder or inch across a ledge
im not sure what the practical use of an invisible rifle is butmeh
you might be carrying a panzerschlag and a fallschirmjaeger carbine but they just arent there
would it have been too hard to show the weapons slung on his back or something
of course the second you complete the climb the weapons reappearthere are serious clipping errors
enemies will fire through vehicles in certain places and hit you
if you return fire it will ricochet
its a oneway deal and youre on the buttend of itthe hud tells you which direction youre being attacked from
or at least thats what it is supposed to do
the most recent examplestill fresh in my mindis when a nazi fired a rocket at me
it passed by me on the right hit a wall and my hud flashed redtelling me that i was being attacked from the left
so i spun left
no one there
another rocket comes into the hallway
now im being attacked from straight ahead even though im looking down a completely empty hallway
most of the time the hud gets it right but every so oftenbeware
bewaresometimes youll find crates of grenadesa blessed relief since you in this example dont have any left
so you walk over to get them andwellyou cant
it just doesnt let you pick them up
but the next time you come through that level try it again
sometimes itll let you take them
sometimes it wont
i have no idea how it decides whether or not to hand em oversimilarly sometimes enemies when killed will drop their weapons halfunder a table or something
when this happens theyre out of reacheven if youre standing on half the weapon you cant get the ammo from it
in parts of the game where ammo is scarce this can lead to your premature deathonly a bare amount of effort was put into some of these encounters and animations
example you come across a nazi during his daily constitutional ie a nice satisfying dump
what does he do
he looks up surprised and raises his arms to surrender
normally at this point id just kill him but on my second time through i wanted to see what he would do if i just stared at him
turns out he just repeats that same animation over and over
looks down
looks up
surprised
hands up
looks down
looks up
surprised
hands up
and so on
this particular nazi either has the attention span of a goldfish or the developers were too lazy to come up with anything better than a sixsecond looping animation
im guessing the latter
and finallythis bullet point must be stressed hence its separation from the list
the mp
what
the
heck
is the matter with it
 of the time it works just fine
other times though ill step out into a hall aim andnothing
it just doesnt fire
but thats not all
no
when this happens the game also locks you into the mp so you cannot switch weapons you cannot reload you cannot even get out of aiming mode
the one cure seems to be to throw a grenade if you have one
ive been killed several dozen times because my mp randomly decided to lock up and refuse to function
this happens often enoughabout  in  aimsthat you really come to hate the mp and will refuse to use it
this problemlocking in the aim and locking the controls uponly ever seems to happen with the mp
its never happened with another weapon
this is a very prominent bug as the mp is probably the most common weapon in the game
its the kind of easily noticeable glitch that only a halfbaked attempt at a game would allow to stand
its also the most frustrating out of any of the things ive listed because it basically reduces you to a walking target you cant sprint while aiming until you manage to shake it loose by pushing every button on your controller randomly
the mp will also occasionally lock up even when youre firing from the hip not in aiming mode in other words
its not as bad when this happens because the weapon will do this updown hiccup animation and then be able to fire again
still annoying thoughfinally though this games settings and storyline are rather epic the entire presentation feels flat and lifeless
there is no investment in the story
theres barely a story
and some of it i just dont understandif you found out that germans were building an abomb in london and you knew where in london their lab was but youre in america what do you do
well if it were me id get on whatever means of commo i had to tell the brits what i knew so they could do something aboutnot in turning point
no
in this game the fate of new york city again with that fing town rests on your shoulders
carson
the construction worker
they have this guy parachuting in like hes qualified airborne sent in solo against a heavily armed german garrison in the tower of london
it just doesnt make sense
what kind of a resistance sends over one plane carrying one guy who has no military training to save the world
a really stupid resistance thats whati was hoping for a scene like freedom fighters had near the endthat dramatic bloodpumping scene where the ships and fighters are advancing across the ice toward governors island and that amazing music is playing and you truly feel like the leader of a resistance
dozens of your fellow freedom fighters assault alongside you and you really feel like youre in a battleinstead i got one plane and one guy parachuting in like hes freakin john rambo with a grudge
remember carson is a construction worker
hes not delta force
but apparently the resistance in their infinite wisdom chose to send carson over trained soldiers
there wasnt any drama to accompany this daring assault eitherso lets review
utter lack of an interesting story but an outstanding concept
with a bare amount of extra effort they could have turned it into something amazing
add some more voice actors
write some scripts
treat your gamers to  minute cutscenes where you get to know your fellow freedom fighters
toss in extra background info to set up the next challenge and youll have an epic story of resistance vs nazis
cest la vienumerous game glitches like clipping errors and heads up display screwups abound
those grenades that land at an enemys feet and dont kill him
mps that lock up your entire controller and lead to your death many many times
and so on
those things
yeah
i guess they just skipped that whole quality assurance portion of development
you know where they work out the bugs
they must have just shelved that stepokay i think ive about covered all of the things in turning point that bothered me and detracted from the overall experiencebut you might notice i rated it two stars and not one
why you might ask given that you just listed a million and one reasons why no one should play itwell cause its not a nonfunctional broken game like two worlds or neverwinter nights  those two were so bad on so many levels that they were quite literally unplayable
turning point is not among that drek
no in fact alongside those previously mentioned titles turning point starts to seem like call of dutylets face it
shooting nazis is fun even if youre doing it in a glitchy slowpaced predictable subpar shooter
and the environmental kills are fun too
lots of fun
imagine kicking a nazi in his jewels then shoving him into a furnace and shutting the door on him
orin another instance kicking the jack out from under a truck a nazi is working on crushing him
see
funso its not all bad
its just mostly badthe bottom line if you like fps andor hate nazis this is worth a twonight rental
my recommendation is not to purchase it
its not worth more than the five or six bucks you pay out at the rental storethis game i had very high hopes for i love clive barkers work both book and on the silver screen but unfortunately this game does not transition like it should
the games controls are horrid the ai is just moronic enemies will stand out in the middle of nowhere the concept of the game is interesting but sadly the gameplay shuts the door on enjoying the story for what it is voice acting isnt bad but it is not good either
was saddened by this game even though i paid  for itjericho sports wonderful graphics a decent storyline and some sick sick thinking all of which i like
this is offset by the horrible linearity of the game which destroys suspension of disbelief and the ability to lose myself in the storyif i want linearity i can read a novel
video games are supposed to offer choices  that is why people play them
a video game should not herd you from location to location but jericho does
i found the feature where you switch between characters fun for about two minutes and then it became irritating as i was herded into doing so multiple times
again  the game was making the choices instead of me
thats bad design in my opinionfinally i was extremely disgusted to see the reemergence of a horrible programming technique from the supernintendo days  being forced to play little games where you tap a series of buttons and die over and over in a loop until you get them right
for instance a corpse suddenly rises out of the ground and grabs you
tap a to punch it in the face
now tap b to push it away
tap y to kick it in the crotch
quick
tap b again to smash its head with your hammer
you get the idea
boringbottom line  i cannot stomach being herded from point to point despite the interesting storyline
ill never finish this game
four hours into it ive grown bored of tapping various button combinations in response to prompts on the screen and running down pathways that dont branch at alljust something to kill time buy cheap then its ok to play otherwise i wont waste time played for about an hour and gave uplooking back ive got to to say that i have yet to find any game developed or published under the codemasters logo that ive truly enjoyed
ive come across quite a few and ive tried to give them the benefit of the doubt picking up and playing through most of them
the end result for pretty much all of them left me with the feeling i get when i take a bite of one of those fluffy french pastries with the powdered sugar on top sort of sweet but filled with nothing but air and really messy at the end
they try but just dont seem to have the revenue or the skill to match their convictions
its too bad because id be more than happy to give them an a for effortgameplay starfor this type of story id almost think they shot themselves in the foot by turning it into a basic firstperson shooter and the way codemasters seems to do shooters is to have you wander down corridorlike areas and literally swamp you with wave upon wave of enemies at periodic intervals
kill all of them travel a little bit further and repeat
for this type of concept a resident evil style of play would be better in my opinion
make it a little slower paced but more suspenseful
after all its supposed to be horror not straight bangem up action
and the action is mindnumbingly dull meaning walk forward pull a trigger walk forward push a button open a door walk forward kill everything thats not a team member while avoiding exploding demons and barrels
yawn
that style of play tends to lose its impact for me very quicklystory starsaccording to the story before god created adam he created a prior sexless entity named the firstborn
indescribably powerful but apparently viewed as a flawed creation by its maker the firstborn was left abandoned banished from its fathers sight to wander alone in a barren nether realmjealous of the attention that it sees god lavishing on humanity it resolves to destroy man and recapture gods love for itself
it breaks through to our world at the site of alkhali roughly translated from arabic as the empty quarter an ancient abandoned city of the middle eaststrange sightings are reported from that area along with unusual weather patterns prompting the deployment of a special team of soldiers to investigate each gifted with their own unique supernatural abilityit quickly goes south from theregraphics starsthe visuals of jericho are incredibly detailed
this is the most immersive aspect of the game that ive found
the creatures are grotesque the zone in the desert you find yourself in is convincingly remote and forlorn and i love the effect when after one of the demons is killed a swarm of flies flows over the body to devour it
i find myself playing the game just to see that at times
your team members and the demons are also very intricate in their designsound starsthe ambience is wonderfully rendered through the sound effects music and dialogue at first
it quickly becomes repetitive after the first few levels
there are only a few points where the dialogue wanders off the beaten path
that kind of thing only serves to remind me that this is in fact a gamereplay stari have found no way to get anything different from going through this game more than once
its the same areas the same enemies and the same nonwitty sarcastic remarks from your team members each time you pop it into your console
i do try to get something different out of each game or movie that i watch but this one just didnt manage to draw me in enoughoverall starsagain sadly the idea behind clive barkers jericho showed promise but poor execution marred it beyond any hope of true quality
unless youre the type of person that enjoys simplistic gameplay this game will probably leave a void where satisfaction is supposed to beand i have a feeling that thats exactly what the firstborn wantsi would like to start off with for what is the strongest selling point of a game the story
as far as i can tell having played through this game the story is horrible
its not explained whats happening what you are doing and even who you are
who are the azeir
i couldnt tell you
for a game that was sitting in development for so long they sure did not do anything with the story
did the humans make the redeyes
are we on one planet
what is the deal with the norse mythology
no one knows
i go onto wikipedia or check the wiki sites no one knows
this for me ruined the game i decided to just go back to fallout  which conversly has a storythe gameplay was horrible the controls for attacking limited to say the very least
i found myself continually mashing the thumbsticks and occasionally doing something that helped
ranged weapons were really quite useless the whole juggling aspect was inane and useless
again for a game to be in development for so long why are there no combo moves
no specific gameplay stratagies for different weapon classes
why is the laser the most weak gun for no good reason
not to mention i found it quite infuritating when a god couldnt do basic first aid to himself i found the respawning happening far too often later in the gamethe camera yeah about that
it almost seemed like they wanted this game to fail the camera was all but useless
not to mention it often tried to show how beautiful the game is it really is but ends up making you lose track of where you are and whom your fighting
not to mention from time to time the camera shows you something that makes no sense
you are aboard this world serpent which by a view behind you is launching icbms
to where
no clue because when you finish the stage nothing has been leveled by nuclear explosions
did the level designer just not talk to the plot writer
maybe there just was no plot writer which would explain quite a few thingsi really wanted this game to be good i wanted to enjoy playing it
but after playing  hours into the game the only reason i continue was to get more achievment points to best my brother
games are meant to be like books have a plot that is fun to read in this case play
i wouldnt recommend even renting this game its not worth the  at blockbusterprosthis game was very fun and very inventiveit is a game that everyone should play
when you do though play it for at least a couple of hours to get used to it thoughthe controls are goofy and frustrating at first but once you get used to them you wonder why you would want to do it any other wayso coolness and fun i give this game  or  starsconsthis game just ends right in the middle of the plot
you have to buy the next  games to find out what is going onthis game doesnt end on a subplot like the halo franchise or any other for that matter
with most games you expect the ending is coming and at least something gets wrapped up
its like playing halo half way through and then just throwing the game awayso to play  actual game you are going to have to spend darn near  for all  again this doesnt end really on a subplot either
you find out a piece of information and then the credits role and tell you to buy the second oneso this game was fun but do not buy it
rent it spend a day or two on it and give it backi started playing this game having high hopes than i realized the storyline was kinda dumb than after that a few minutes later i died in the game and  waited for the stupid angel to revive me about  seconds later cause you cant fast foward through this after respawning i died again and again every  minutesthis game was made to be way too hard and on top of that the camera angle is gonna drive you nutes when you got  enemies coming after you and cant lock on to the enemie you wanna attackafter all this the controls imo suck and you will wonder why it took  years to make this crappy gameim atm stuck on trying to kill a monster that apparently wont die as i hit it just keeps attacking me without taing any damage at all died  times and quit playing i would not recommend wasting  bucks on this garbage maybe pay  bucks only cause its my face genre action adventure type rpgi love games that allow you to upgrade your guns and armor and other things but this games was the same bs run and shoot the same people over and over the enviorments sucked a big one the boss battles are boreging this game really pissed me off
i was hopeing for a good game but nooooooooooo i got too stupid my bad too human and please do not die oh my god the same things happens everytime and you can not skip it this game was bad period 
i enjoyed mass effect alot more then this crap anyway buy at your own riski am not a tremendous fan of the actionpseudorpg genre but there have been some of these games that i have really enjoyed such as assassins creed and saints row
this game however suffers from defects that significantly detract from its enjoyableness for those of us who just want to play and have fun not wrestle with a games difficulties or just sycophantically embrace itthe main defect as expressed in other reviews is the camera control
it is erratic at best
as i played the camera would swing around to the front or side and the only way to regain control is to center the view by pushing left bumper but this sudden change in point of view was very confusing for me especially when moving or when confronted by enemiesi found the character baldur difficult to control as well
when surrounded by enemies i found it difficult to get baldur to turn and engage the enemies behind him
often it seemed like he would root in place resulting in him getting backstruck repeatedly
and this isnt something that you can afford
the game is pretty unforgiving with healing
there isnt enough of it for a casual player like me who just wants to play and have fun not die every  to  minutesi found the game unintuitive and the ingame tutorial tips insufficiant
the first level was easy relatively compared to the second level where the difficulty ramps up unexpectedly and significantly
too significantly
i was completely unprepared for the difficulty of the second level and the game itself offered little help
i was dying over and over far too frequently for the game to be even remotely enjoyable and everytime i died i was subjected to a cutscene of baldur being taken by a valkyrie that got old after the second time that i saw it and was just intensely annoying everytime after that
this cutscene is just conceit on the game designers part and a blatant disregard for the fact that most people have only a limited time to play their games and they dont need it wasted watching the same pointless scene over and over againi am not saying that this game is completely bad
i am sure that some people perhaps those more time on their hands than i care to waste will enjoy it
i would suggest renting the game and playing through the second level before you decide to buy
dont trust the demo
the first level is much much easier than the second and the demo is just an abbreviated version of the first level
the second level may be more difficult than you want to waste your time with if you are a casual gamer as i am
for me the aim of the game is entertainment and with its lousy camera control difficult to control character and lack of intuitiveness this game failed miserablely to entertain methis game just feels broken
i hate the unskippable resurrection cutscene and the worst part is you die a lot so youll have to endure this cutscene often
i would love to know which idiot thought that making it so long and unskippable was a good idea
and why are there so many enemies ever few steps
the game is just so repetitive and annoying
the only good thing i can say is the art direction is really imaginative but i wouldnt recommend buying it at all i rented from blockbuster and wound up returning it without finishing i had a few days left to keep it but couldnt bring myself to do sothe silicon knights too human title made exclusively for the xbox  has come and gone and this review is as i am aware of late
this game attempts to tie in elements of some of your favorite dungeon crawlers rpgs and actionadventure games
simply it is attempting to do a lot of things here all at once
so without further ado lets get to the reviewstory the story revolves around an imaginary interpretation of the norse gods and their dealings
you play as baldur one of the many norse gods known as the sir
this is a science fictionfantasy game and setting the einherjar roll with you into combat and use guns and the like while you use guns but also melee weapons like swords and war hammers
you fight against the machines that are known as the children of ymir
from what little i could gather from the story line as this was supposed to be a series i am not sure if they are going to keep it going odin is a machine which stands for organically distributed intelligence network and i am assuming as it should be the leader of the sir
this is a very dark take on how the norse mythology and story went about with a lot of futuristic elements combined into it
for me the story and characters was the only saving grace of this game
they were pretty compelling as actual characters and the story and lore held quite a bit of possibilitygameplay this is where everything starts to get ugly
the majority of the combat is based upon watching some of your boys run in and get severely murdered and then here you come running in to save the day
yet all your boys die so quickly and are completely useless that most times they only help the enemies by blocking your view once in a while
the guns that are utilized at the beginning are utterly worthless against even the easiest enemies and it takes a while to find ones that you actually end up willing to use
the melee combat is all controlled with the right joystick of the xbox  controller
so you can turn quickly and attack different directions with relative ease
however most of the enemies are flinch proof and will continue to attack you even while they are getting a giant sword through the face
then there is no block so you are at the mercy of the enemies unless you utilize the omnipotent roll
yes this is the greatest roll in human history and i am sure jesus himself would be envious of this kind of roll
it is the type of roll that lets you roll across the surface of water
you fight larger enemies periodically throughout the game
some of these enemies have a move where they smash the ground and a shockwave moves across the ground
what was my first instinct jump over it of course
no if you attempt to jump over it it apparently without any kind of animation jumps up into the air and hits you
so i begin to sigh as these enemies who are otherwise simple become  super hard when they do that  times in a row making it impossible for you to get close and defeat them
awesome
then by accident i rolled through the shockwave with much to my surprise no damage taken
really i rolled through a shockwave on the ground and remained untouched while jumping over it yields a hitmoving on there is no way to actually ever lose the game
there is no game over screen or fade to the main menu
nope you just magically respawn at a checkpoint
run up to the enemy that killed you and mystically he is at the exact same hp you left him at and your little minions are still getting slaughtered
so in essence this game is literally unloseable
a  year old given enough time could beat this game
your equipment takes damage as you die in thee game and will eventually break should you die way too many times see items section for why this is not that bad
oh yeah and sure you lose your combo meter which affects your ability to pull of the special moves but all you have to do is once again go mindlessly kill a couple of enemies and then bam it is once again filling up
i mean really this is the greatest you could come up with
then after you die you sit and watch a beautiful  second yes it is that long of a valkyrie coming and picking up your body to apparently play god and resurrect you
it is a beautiful scene like the first  times you watch it then after you are just wanting to be able to skip it
where is the motivation to not die where is the motivation to become good at the game to resist the epic angerfest of the game over screen when you havent saved in  hours
in the end the fact that you cant lose or die makes this game incredibly boringlevel design let me put it simply there really isnt that much
you play through like  or  different levels
each level takes well over an hour to beat
while you are playing for this hour to sometimes  hours depending on how many times you have to reincarnate yourself apparently the design stays exactly the same not even so much a change in colors or enemies just the same monotonous regime over and over again
so after about  minutes the level is nothing new and now boring to the eye
then you get to go through that  or  more times great that sounds wonderfulitems there are without a doubt more weapons armor and items in this game than i have ever seen in any other game
this is the only thing that ends up not becoming boring
they consist of so many different types with so many different abilities that you almost never stop collecting them
though i am ocd about the look of my characters and hate when they do not match perfectly this in this game ends up being almost impossible
i am however not going to hold my own problems against the game
want to use a different weapon go out questing in one of the  available levels yea that makes me so happy and find a new piece of gear though near the end of the game it ends up becoming a hassle to find new gear that is even worth you looking at
yet you find so many items which includes armor and weapons that if your stuff does manage to break it really is not an easy feat unless you are trying you will find something that is good enough to replace it maybe not as sweet but still decent enough to get the job donegraphics for their time they were not all that terrible but not really that revolutionary
silicon knights was having quite an issue with epic games over the unreal engine
so that may have had something to do with it but like previously stated they are not bad just not great either
so they were about middle maybe a little higher middle of the bunchsound the voice acting is what may have given the characters their believability and deep connections
they are done very well over and over again and i can only count on a few times that something may have sounded weird or out of place slightly
the music however i did not appreciate at all
i felt distracted by it and a little agonized by the whole thing as it did not add to my experienceclosing remarks this game had so much to offer in the form of story and characters in the beginning that i got excited and then with a pure lack of ability turned into a complete let down for me
i ended up finishing the game hoping for a cool ending and some great story points but it ended up just being a letdown as well
the game ended up trying to do too many things all at once and ended up doing very few of them correctly
the game had very slight brief moments where i was liek hey i am having fun then they faded just as fast as they camegraphics sound  not appealing to the music just voice actingstory gameplay replayability   yeah cause i want to play the same boring   levels over and over and over again
just stop gameput bluntly too human is not very good at all
it has some unique ideas but are very poorly implemented
take the primary offender the right analog stick driven combat
whoever thought this was a good idea was probably brain dead as it feels extremely clumsy and counter intuitive
as youre sliding about boffing robots on the head youll catch on other enemies and endure many cheap deaths after which youll be lifted into the sky by a robot angel and plopped back on the ground apropos of nothing
if loot is what youre here for too human has it in spades but the mediocre combat doesnt make your dragon scale jockstrap of popularity feel like its worth havingyou use the left bumper to center the camera behind your head and enter a sort of free look mode but the hard cut to this viewpoint and the utter uselessness of the free look makes me wonder if all of silicon knights had been high while making this
to make everything feel more worthless clicking the right stick initiates a close up look at baldurs facethe whole thing smacks of passion project but not in a good way
one of my favorite games from last year dust an elysian tail was a passion project but dean dodrill knew what worked and what didnt pushed past his pride and cut the fat out
silicon knights obviously had a monumental ego because there are a lot of things that any normal developer would change for the sake of a good product that sk wouldnt do for the sake of its baby
for example look back on the infamous amys baking company episode where amy was in aggressive denial about her cooking and told all the dissenters to go  themselves
too human is like that blue ribbon burger bc some things just dont worktoo human is the new diablo clone on the x
it is a fun game but be prepared to wade through a lot of messy poorly programmed mistakes to get to itheres a hint to other developers if you have mutiple dialogue languages options in your game and then list that the game has subtitles you should probably actually have subtitles all the way through at least for the cutscenes
not just for  in  also  second death animations went out of style before we even knew what death animations were
also also over the top gung ho manly men were only ever done correctly in aliens
for crying out loud stop trying to do it
they come off as idiotic immature losers
i suppose much the same as the audience theyre aimed at but for crying out loud lets try leading by example instead
also tutorial messages should stay on the screen until i choose to make them go away not after  seconds
especially when theyre long enough to take up half the screenalso also also terrible writing
permission to kick ass sir is not a dialogue line i should ever have to hear much less every  minutesalso x  if youre making a god
like in this game
baldur
dont make him look like a overweight gym teacher that never married
and moral raising speeches do not need to be as long as they are nor as lame and stupid soundingsilicon knights you people have no talentthey literally rip of every cool masculine genre convention out there from the opening of diablo ii to aliens to even using bullet time from the matrix
yeah bullet time
that thing everyone is sick of
even worse every woman in the game makes it very obvious that they think baldur is just the hottest meat on the hoof
mayby sk needs to hire some people who are actually attracted to men because this fellow theyve made
this baldur
not only is he ugly but hes chubby too
in fact the woman are portrayed so offensively that i just have to shake my head and stare several characters even go into tirades about how woman have no place on the battle field and all theyre good for is sex and magicand no one ever disagrees with them even the women who are presentalso again every character has these idle animations they do when you arent controlling them
they obviously have ants in their chocolate mines because they do them instantly and constantly
and you know what they are
professional wrestling streches
it just looks so stupid i cant believe it
thats what this storyline is norse gods replaced with cybernetic professional wrestlersagain tho the game itself is great fun
half the time im enjoying the gameplay which is new and tricky and half the time im scrambling for the mute button and hammering the skip cutscene button which doesnt work all the time eitheri was foolish enough to doubt the countless bad reviews this game got
i figured id give it a fair shotthis game is bad
so bad that i will keep it short and sweetgraphics  i really could care less about graphics but i know it is a major selling point for some gamers
too human has beautiful large environments
i say large because the levels seem huge with backgrounds that go on for days but you are basically confined to halway size paths that you run through and repetively slash at enemiescharacter equipment designs are gorgeous
facial textures look laughable on some characters though
mainly baldur himselfsound  sound along with equipment design are the only  stars i will give this game
the musical score is good and so are the sound effectscontrols the rightthumbstick controls are controversial
i see what the designers were trying to do and in fact the combat controls seem to work however a totally broken lock on system breaks the controls
you will litteraly have a giant  feet in front of you
tilt the thumbstick in front of you and theres a good chance you will forego this behemoth to target some random midget that is minding his own business ft away
this is inexcusable
this problem is compounded with a horrible camera system
forget about using the default camera and pull back to iso mode
even iso mode however cannot save you from camera seizures that happen when you try to turn a corner or even turn a gameplay ok this is where i could rant forever but i will try to be brief game is made of only  ungodly massive levels combat is broken by the camera and lockon system character classes are totally unbalanced
certain classes are dying machines
imagine playing an mmo where every class has a purpose in a team concept but there is no team only you maybe one friend online speaking of online it is broken as well
the enemies level to the highest lvl character in the group
so i got my game a week before my friend
i reached level  he was lvl   we figured the game would find a happy medium to scale the baddies to
wrong
every creature was lvl 
resulting in my friend dying every  secs pointlessly boring cyberspace quests bosses have way too much health garn especiallystory  the story is pretty bland with bad voice acting and dialogue for choosing norse mythology instead of greek or something else thats been run into the ground for choosing baldur as the main character when you have thor and tyr as supporting characters
baldur is so sissified that his mother had to beg everything in creation not to kill her son but he ends up dying at the hands of the only thing she thought harmless enough not to ask mistletoe
 the story could be compeling but nothing is explained
the designers must have figured that norse mythology is the  religion in the world and everyone knows it like the back of their hands
nothing is explained only refered to
characters are introduced with little to know backstory
the story in this game basically sucks because of presentationso on a final note there is a lot of complaining about the death scene
it is there to mask the loadinggame over screen you would see in any other game
i actually think this is a good idea
the bad part of it is that  you will die so many times in this broken game that you will see the valkyrie animation  timesfor the love of god if this did not detour you from playing this game at least rent it and judge for yourselfi really liked this game a lot during the first two hours of play
its was sharp but really fell flat in the long run
it is extremely repetitive and upgrading your weapons throughout the game becomes annoying
there is not replay value on normal setting its very easy to beat
i was looking forward to this game and i was very very dissapointed after i played it for a bit
this game sucks
btw i beat it played online went through two different classes of characters i gave it a chance
traded it in losing about  after two weeks
skip this onei just finished too human and i can only recommend it to players who are dying for a hack n slash for the   this game has some great innovation and some horrendous flawsstorythe story is a mix between the matrix and norse mythology
as the story began i felt like i was reading the th novel in a series because all sorts of epic things were happening and i had no clue what was going on
apparently the norse gods live in the matrix fight monsters with swords and laser guns and travel through cyber space
my friends told me the story was awful and i really tried to like it but i just couldnt
the main character baldur is voiced by crispin freeman of hellsing
im a big fan of hellsing still couldnt get into the storygameplaythe gameplay basically sucks
you use the triggers to fire your long range weapons and the right analog stick to point to the enemy that you want to attack with a melee weapon
sword hammer  if you double tap the stick you launch the enemy into the air and you can jump combo them or shoot them as they fall
this is pretty fun
however often times you target enemies that you dont want to target
to make matters worse some enemies explode or poison you
so you end up dying from time to time by accident
what really breaks the game is that unless you play the bioops class you cannot heal yourself
thats right
no health potions regeneration heal spells nothing
the only way to get health is from random enemy drops
sometimes you can kill  guys and they dont drop anything
other times you can kill  and  of them drop health
this is extremely frustrating because you may be near death and theres nothing that you can do
there are crystals that you can destroy in the environment that drop health money or weapons but those are random as well
with no consistent way to regain health you end up dying repeatedly
this is no fundeathdying takes about  seconds to a minute
an angel comes down and takes your body away
there are times in this game where i saw the angel more than i was playing
this was very frustratingeconomythe economy of the game is pretty good
you never have too much money and you need to make decisions on what weapons you wantinventorythis game may feature the best rpg inventory system of all time
its incredibly easy to sell buy and customize your weapons and armor
you dont have to waste hours in cities like most other rpgs
its all done with the start button and a few inventory screensartthe art style of the game is very cool
a nice blend of warhammer k and norse mythologycamerathe camera is your friend most of the time
however sometimes the camera is not your friend
when you are in combat it is difficult to target enemies and you often target the wrong enemy
the camera points to that enemy allowing you to get killed from behind
this is no funrpgyou get new gear and level up quite often and that gives you a good sense of accomplishment
however the enemies level up with you so most of the encounters feel exactly the sameoverallplaying through the game once takes about  hours
about  of those hours are fun
 of those hours are nonsensical cutscenes
 of those hours are spent leveling up and getting new gear
the other  or  hours are painfulso if youre a big fan of hack and slash games dont mind a weird story want to play diablo without health potions and know a bit about norse mythology pick it upanyone else youve been warned
youre in for a confusing and frustrating timei was hestitant after playing the demo and my disappointments were confirmed after i played this at a friends place
and since i just finished ninja gaiden  and vikings battle of asgard th was particularly disappointingmy views concur with many of the reviews here
the good points include fairly impressive graphics
visually its quite a treat but thats about the only thing it has going for iti really wanted to like this game but it was hard
to cut a long story short this game will put you to sleep
there are promising features  five classes of characters to play skills trees upgrades and loads of loot to pick up but the core aspect of the gameplay is repetitive
while repetition can be fun there is little real innovation to the fighting of th and when this is combined with level designs and enemies that replay again and again as the game progresses its rather hard to sustain ones interest level
as everyone already knows the melee fighting is done via right stick movement this just doesnt do it for me
i was yawning by the rd level
not that it was easy the waves upon waves of assaulting enemies will overwhelm you but the way the fighting controls are done i dont find it entertaining and there was little satisfaction in the slaughter
and as already highlighted by others the camera is problematic while the audio is averageapart from the graphics all other aspects of the game seem like xboxps standard and the game certainly doesnt match its peers on the  im actually quite curious as to the affairs of the games development
i heard the prolonged development was due to legal issues perhaps the people at silicon knight were too occupied with these issues raher than devoted fully to make the game greatand before you know it its over omg i waited  years  years for this bsbeing as im something of a cynical jerk and usually anything with the attached phrases of badass or kickass set off my anger button i had absolutely low expectations for this game whereas i also hoped it could convert me similar to how jedi knights ii and iii had much of the attached phrases of badass and kickass attached to them yet i found them enjoyable by themselves without the uninteresting storiesbecause im a cynical jerk i have to get out of the way the unimportant complaints first the game trailers did absolutely nothing to convince me to want to try this game commercial one featuring generic loner badass  as i call him doing some kind of kamehamehameha
on a wookiee that destroys half the map
i figured this was kind of ridiculously overpowered but ill get to that lateron another unfair point generic loner badass  lives up to his name in both appearance and power
he is about as unremarkable and boring a character as kyle katarn without the frilly beard or the im just an honest exassassin bartender jerk from assassins creed
his outfit is a random mishmashing of robes and other dark things youd likely find at a robeversion of hot topic to likely appeal as much as possible to the dude this game is so badass crowd of gamers who set off my anger buttonbut back to the game itself graphically its as expectedthe pros first the environment is highly interactive and one of my favorite things to do in space levels is to use the force to throw objects at the plasteel windows sending atmosphere and objects out into space before blastdoors close shut on themdespite being completely against the star wars canon of the force being a mystical force whose ominence was in its invisibility it is fun to do things like use it to grab objects and move them around with amazing control and amazing reactionenemy troopers will leap out of the way of flying crates but if caught will be swept off their feet or smacked aside
its amazing to see the force used to pull tie fighters off their racks or bed metal girders to block the path of flyby starfighters and cause them to crashmy primary aesthetic complaint is the force itself
the use of the force in the movies and tv shows and most of the games is most memorable for having no appearance and mostly no sound save for that eardrum crushing hum it makes such as when darth vader chokes admiral motti on the death star for a few seconds
that makes it terrifying
here it is given loud sounds when used force push in particular sounding like a huge laser cannon and given purple waves to accompany it so you can always see where it is and what its doingthen the action itself if youve played the video games for star wars clone wars  or star wars revenge of the sith  then youll pretty much get this game right away
its the exact same format rather god of war style in which the only controls needed for your lightsaber are to hit the attack button as many times as you can and generic loner badass  will swing it all which ways nonstop in a combo that can get you killed if you dont stop long enough to deflect blaster boltsthis is compared to a game like jedi outcastacademy where specific lightsaber attacks differed depending on a combination of buttons used and gave it a far more interactive feeling
here it just feels like giving a command use your lightsaber to kill this guy and generic loner badass  will fight his own way without your inputfor all its beautiful spit and polish in lightsaber combat they really badly cut back on blaster deflection you absolutely cannot deflect blaster bolts unless you stop and press one of the buttons i think it was b and hold it
then generic loner badass  proceeds to do the exact same lightsaber swinging loop to deflect bolts nonstop until you let go
this same loop is reused and never changesthe lightsaber itself that he starts with seems to be pretty weak as most enemies ive found are taken out with usually one powerful swing but a fairly large amount take more than that to be killed
and considering the stilted monotonous actions the lightsaber combat takes its impossible to easily attack and kill multiple opponents firing on you youre better off just using your force powersand then come the force powers
if lucasarts is trying to sell this generic loner badass as the omfg bestest most uber jedi sith in the evar
then they succeeded too well he is grossly overpowered to a point where he is more powerful than yoda darth sidious darth vader and mace windu combined
its utterly ridiculous to see him slice an atst in half with one swoop or press and hold the force push button for half a second to unleash a kamehamehaaa
 type blast which kills the crap out of everything in its path guaranteed and takes up very little force energy to useso the game has little lasting appeal beyond a oneday rental that will see longtime lucasarts gamers feel a blinding gush of dejavu from the days of clone wars and episode iii video game and ultimately disappointed at how heavily hyped this rental game was only to end up being just another lucasarts release that will likely be forgotten within a year or morealthough fun at first unfortunately sw force unleashed just doesnt ever get far enough off the ground to be anything memorable
im in the unusual position of having played this game right after finishing up ninja gaiden ii
im afraid that may have made the problems with this game shine even more for me
first off is the combat
its not bad but its not great either
everything felt bogged down and slow
many things i would make my character do felt delayed
for action games like this you need complete control and i never felt like i had it in this game
the camera was also really bad
i could deal if there were an easier way of positioning it but when you move the camera yourself with the thumb stick it moves really slow like the rest of the combat
theres a way to snap the camera to the players back instantly which is great except that you have to click the left thumb stick to do it
too often im running around and if i click the thumb stick the camera snaps to my back and immediately moves the direction im running so its still not centered on my back
i found it better to start throwing force pushes and lightning in the opposite direction i couldnt see and hope id get lucky before trying to move the camera
the lockon feature sucks but thats okay with me because if developers make these games right you wont need one anyway
the engine also seemed glitchy
there were plenty of times where id hang in the air
sometimes the frame rate would drop and things would get choppy although that didnt happen that much
also i know its a star wars game and you dont want blood but give me something that helps me realize when im hitting something
especially the bigger enemies
give me some particle effects or something
half the time it doesnt look like youre hitting anything at all in this game
its also difficult to distinguish when something is hitting you as well
there were plenty of times where i felt i was doing good and all of the sudden i died
only then do i realize wow i was getting hit by something the whole time
this is offset by the feature of getting health back for every kill which is a must have for this game
you wouldnt need that feature if the combat elements were polished enough that a player could keep from getting hit provided he was skillful enough
screw it im just gonna post the pros and cons
if you are a big fan of star wars id add one more star to my rating and thats probably the extent youll enjoy this gameprosforce powers are fun to play withstory is a decent tie in to the moviesconscombat is slow and repetitivecontrols are iffy and slow to respondgame is short with little reason to play againthe platforming elements are not goodyou feel like a weaklingthe force throw is just about brokenits just not fun
sorryi really cant believe some of the high marks some people have given this game
it glitches out so many times at least two or three times i had to manually turn off my xbox and restart because of a glitch
many other times i got stuck on some invisible wall
the ai is horrible and does not live up to the hypeits not all bad  its always fun to kill storm troopers with a lightsaber
the cutscenes look pretty and the voice acting and music are goodthis game tries to follow the god of war formula and apply it to star wars slash and hack and level up with new combos
its not a bad idea but its so poorly executed youll wish you were playing the old wireframe xwing gamei love anything set in the star wars universe
this game is no exception to the point that its only saving grace is just that
if this werent a star wars game it wouldnt even have gotten the nd star
the controls are clumsy awkward and just plain maddening at times
especially when you are trying to use your force grip on a group of enemies that have bunched up on you to beat the crap out of you only to grip some object nowhere near where you are facing causing you to take damage or get killed entirely
when you get hit your character gets stunned for what feels like forever so the faster enemies will just get combo after combo in on you without you being able to do anything to counterthe camera angles are awful as well where you find yourself constantly fighting the camera floating around to a different vantage point that is the complete opposite of helpful for you at the moment
this is especially poor when you have your back against a wall and are fighting enemies in that the camera becomes smashed against the wall with you giving you an awkward tight over the shoulder view where you can hardly see what you are doingthe storyline is very short making it so that is it has any replay value it will have to be because the harder difficulties are worth playing through
to some extent they are but at the hardest difficulty the aforementioned issues are far more pronounced and make you want to throw your console through the windowanother issue i had with this game was the useless cut scenes that were put in the most irritating places most times right after a save point so that if you died you would have to watch the cut scene over and over without being able to skip it
tremendously aggravating when playing on the harder difficulties where you are dyeing more often
i had to literally turn the game off and do something else i would get so pissed about watching the same stupid cut scene over and over at times
on top of the cut scene and loading screen you could stand to add approximately an entire minute to each and every death which may not seem a big deal to start with but once you die  or so times at a difficult part of the game you just wasted  minutes of gaming merely watching a loading screen or a repeated cut scene
they could have at least made them skippable after the first viewingall in all this is certainly not the worst game i have ever played but it is far from the best in so many ways
just a below average game in my opinion that is maybe worth a rent more so than even the  price tag to be stuck with it foreveri cant honestly remember a time when i wasnt a huge star wars geek
one of the first games i fell in love with was super star wars for snes back in the early s
i loved everything about it
it took the aesthetics of the beloved film series and placed it within the confines of a ridiculously overthetop side scrolling shooter
though i died countless times i managed to beat the original get to cloud city on empire and with luck i managed to complete super return of the jedienter star wars the force unleashedin many ways the force unleashed attempts to do what the former series did in the s it takes the franchise and asks what if we gave it steroids
only for this title it actually takes the notion of the force and brings it to near dragon ball z levels of testosterone
unfortunately its efforts though well intentioned are undermined by some serious design flawsvisuals and audio this is easily the games main success
its simply beautiful even for a title released several years prior to this review
the environments literally look like they came straight out of the most extravagant concept art possible
while the level design itself is mundane in terms of its layout the visual design is ingenious and manages to balance a kind of realism with a comic booklike flair
the music and sound effects are what weve come to expect in a star wars title adding nothing but not taking anything away either
it feels like star wars
the voice acting is likewise competent and i was surprised at how much matt sloan sounds like james earl jones darth vaderstory though ive never read the accompanying book i felt that the story is promising from what ive seen
as this is not an rpg the story segments are not integrated in the game very smoothly but thats to be expected in an action game
the cutscenes and characters are presented nicely and were enjoyablegameplay heres where things fall apart
despite the developers best intentions the awesome levels of destruction on display the controls for this title are simply horrendous
the force unleashed tries to make its gameplay similar to god of wars with the overthetop violence and quick time events though no gore or gratuitous nudity
however unlike that series force unleashed has some of the sloppiest controls ive encountered in a modern day hack n slash
this becomes readily apparent when the difficulty level suddenly spikes
most of the typical hordes are easily dispatched and its tempting to try and toy with the many stormtroopers youll face and then watch with glee as they are pulverized by the dozens
at first youll probably be too distracted by the novelty to notice that the controls for some of starkillers actions are awkward and in the end unsatisfying in their feel
it is a very strange dichotomy
on the one hand you are entertained by the visuals but have to endure the sloppy controls and animations to see themthe lightsabers are also handled strangely
regardless of the difficulty level by the time one had spent roughly thirty minutes into kratoss adventures his weapons felt like an extension of his body and likewise the gamepad thus giving players hugely satisfying combat
for whatever reason be it the rough animation or simply starkillers moves the lightsibers in the force unleashed are awkward to the extent that they feel like one is wielding glowing chopsticks
this is partially due to the fact that with every hit there is a slight pause in the game not a framerate issue mind you but a feature that is simply a part of the design
in short it is very distracting and takes away from the game immenselythe loading screens loading screens typically arent much of a concern for me and they almost never deserve their own paragraph but the force unleashed is a special case
never have i seen so many awkwardly placed loading screens within a game and an action game to boot where presentation flaws like this tend to severely affect ones enjoyment
the fact that there are loading screens for the in game menus including the level up screen is inexcusableconclusion i really wanted to enjoy this title and given its faint praise from fans and some critics my expectations were not unreasonably high
i expected a guilty pleasure and something i could complete over a weekend
instead my already low expectations were met with a game that almost seems like it is trying to not be fun
and other than its novelty and some of its visuals this game is hardly any fun at all
in a game where its most basic and frequent mechanics are plagued with control issues i cant recommend this title to just anyone
but if one is still curious rent or try a demo firsti think this game is a good buy at  or less but not 
the reason is that the game is nothing really detailed or depth to it
it is running around killing anything that moves and moving on to the next mission
although you can customize the abilities they do not seem to make that much of a difference
as you go you unlock more abilities that make for more fun ways of killing the opponents but even then it is just more of the same
the game is very linear and not that imaginative for a star wars game
you really just do not feel your a jedi any more than you feel your the god of war since they both feel much the same except this one has a light saber and only half as goodin short your money is better spent buying god of war for less than half the price and get more gameimma give them props for the story
i read the novel the force unleashed two and a half years ago before i played the video game and i really liked the story
however now that i finally got around to playing the game itself when it comes to the video game the gameplay sucks major donkey doo doo
i think the two other star wars games that i have jedi outcast  jedi academy are better in terms of gameplay
force unleashed is prettier but outcast and academys gameplay is wayyy better and they are much longer games too
force unleashed took two days to complete
but thats ok im not gonna complain so much about the game so much though since it only cost me  bucks brand new anyway
but i still wish lucasarts people would put more effort into developing their games
with star wars being the successful franchise that it is the name star wars alone is not enough to get the job done
lucasarts need to back up the name star wars with better substance and tech in their video game
the substance was there because the story was great
its just that the tech was not because the game play wasnt all that greatthe very first level of this game finds you darth vader striding through the wookie planet kashyyk blasting wookies architecture and the forest to smithereens with an impressive array of force powers
you finally confront and defeat a quavering jedi
freaking awesome
that all lasts about  minutes
then the real game begins and the most enjoyable part of it which youve just experienced gets left far behind
dont get me wrong this game has enjoyable aspects most significantly the simple experience of being able to act out as a superpowerful jedi while rousing star wars themes play in the background
for that alone many people will want to give this a look
just dont get your hopes up that it is some amazing gamethere are games that pull you into the story in which you have to use your mind as well as your hands to get through the game where the choices you make along the way greatly effect the game play and even better the story and outcome
this is not one of those gamesthis game attempts to be the kind that relies on memorizing combos and a whole lot of handeye coordination some jumping around on various platforms and confronting bosses etc
the game that comes to mind in comparison is ninja gaiden or god of war
i say attempts because of the pretty ridiculous mishmash of camera and targeting problems imbalanced powers awful boss battles and repetitive levelsgame play which add up to an experience that is only briefly redeemed by the cool factor of charging around familiar star wars settingsthe game is highly conventional even old school
the game play relies on learning combos jumping around on various platforms and manipulating various environmental elements to solve what are supposed to be puzzles or complete various objectives like destroy  tie fighters on this level
you dont participate in the story you watch it unfold until the action kicks in and then you get to run around smashing crap up with your wacky load of force powersyour main concern will be not falling to your death
it is ridiculously easy to fall off the various catwalks platforms and even many normal walkwayssimple things like executing lightsaber moves that cause the character to lunge forward can lead you right off the edge of a platform
your character has an incredibly powerful jump he can jump high and far but that usually leads to the impossibility of judging the distances properly and he lands very sloppily so you just slip off whatever you were trying to land on and fall to your death
on many levels you spend a ton of time running around wiping out the zillions of enemies then have to backtrack to try to jump to reach a floating sphere in order to acquire your jedi pointsand then you slip and fall to your death requiring you to restart the entire level and kill all those same enemies again and then most likely slip to your death another time
i ended up playing the game through on apprentice mode simply because i found the incidents of getting killed by falling to be more than enough of a challenge and source of numerous reloadsthere is some leveling up but it mostly consists of unlocking various combos
nothing intellectually or strategically challenging just arbitrary based on your playing preferencesthe learning of combos and the combiningproper use of various force powers i found a bit frustrating
maybe someone out there likes combos pressing a sequence of buttons in order to skillfully execute a powerful move
im not one of those people
to me it is simply a waste of brain power to memorize these stupid comboseven worse is the necessity of hitting certain buttons to execute finishing moves at the end of a boss fight
you beat the boss down to zero health then the game forces you to press a sequence of buttons to finish him off in a supposedly cool cinematic and if you dont he returns to partial health
this is utterly annoying and makes no sense
theres no real world corollary to a finishing move
what aspect of life does it represent
stupidthen theres the targeting and camera chaos
you can throw zillions of objects and enemies around but locking on and targeting them is a mess
some stormtrooper will be blasting you with a cannon from a far platform and youll try to zap him with lightning or a force push but there are so many rocks power cells r units and storage boxes littering the landscape that the targeting system will blast everything but the guy you are trying to actually hit
and good luck trying to use your powers to pick up and throw an object at the guythe lock onpick upaimthrow sequence is so cumbersome and sloppy and moving objects with the force is so painfully slow hell waste you before you get your shot lined upthe graphics are as they should be in a next gen game very good
seeing the various levels planets creatures and environments is probably what makes this game worth playing
it is fun to just live in the star wars world especially as most of the environments are made to seem enormous
but that doesnt mean too many extra points in my book like i said the graphics should be amazing its the i disregarded all the negative reviews when i purchased this thinking as a big star wars fan that i would appreciate it anyway
i was wrong
then i thought maybe im just the wrong kind of gamer maybe someone who appreciates combo and platforming games more straight ahead action games would like this and i should soldier on maybe if you are that kind of gamer you would give this  stars instead of two
after some time i realized that the flaws were in the game itself that the game play was unbalanced the camera and targeting were deeply flawed the boss fights were stupid and pointless and that the entire premise of the game was just flimsy
i wish i would have taken those negative reviews more seriouslyi was really looking forward to this game and the demo was good on live but the overall game play is just bad
the story is good but the game play and level up are bad
theres alot of spots where you just get stuck and cant find where to go or how to shut off laser fields
im sick of buying strategy guides so my advice is to wait and buy a used copy and get the guide or save your money there are alot of cool games coming out this fallthe story of the game is sound
there are a few things that sorta clash with the movies but for the most part it worksthe game play is horrible
this game was rushed
the ai is borderline too good  on the normal setting
there are levels where you cant ever get up because the ai shoot you and you fall down and by the time you recover they shoot you again
the whole force powers are great except as soon as you get one set of force powers theres a bad guy that cancels them out  and oh yea they are the only type of bad guy on that leveli understand the point of having bad guy types that can resist your force powers but there not as bad as the game isthe star destroyer level is perhaps the single most frustrating part of video gaming i have ever played
this part is the reason why i give the game  stars instead of i got the game for two reasons i thought it would be fun to run around and use force powers on storm troopers  it is for the first half of the game anyway
 i wanted to know more of the story of what happened between episodes iii and iv
it fills that part in well i thinkgodzilla unleashed is like dating a supermodel with a serious amount of baggage
she looks great on the outside but once you start peeling back layers you can see shes not all shes cracked up to be
the graphics and look of this game are great
with the graphical ability of todays games you can make a game that is very eye appealing and not spend any time on the gameplay or ai of the game itself
this is exactly what is going on here
the writing is poor the premise is boring but having said all that its great to look at
if you are looking for a fun game with great gameplay this isnt it
if you love monster premise games and are more concerned with the look you will probably be happy but dont say you werent warned
 not recommendedi lasted a total of maybe  hours before i had the base game beat
i then let my daughter have her fun with it and she lost interest after not even an hour
since then it has been collecting dust in our library
although it is somewhat fun for a while this game shouldve been released with a  price taggodzilla unleashed is a fun game for a short amount of time
not really much different that the  gamecube game godzilla destroy all monsters unleashed has about the same graphics same game play and same sound quality
i expected more as these two games are six years apart in development
but no developer pipeworks software inc simply took the old game added a few more cities which resemble their realworld locations not at all slapped on clunky and unintuitive wii controls and put it out there in the hopes of getting some of that crazy wii actiondont buy this game
if you have a wii and a gamecube controller just pick up the old godzilla destroy all monsters game for five bucks used
really you are getting almost the exact same game save a few monsters and cities
the story line is dull and boring but you have to play through it to unlock other playable monsters
yes a game you paid for and you cant play all the advertised characters unless you trudge through the single player story for a few hoursthe wii controls are completely unintuitive
clunky and many times unresponsive
you would think fighting games on the wii would be a cool novelty but godzilla unleashed shows how not to implement the wii controlshorrible game that does nothing over a six year old game of similar name by the same developer
dont bother with this title
or if you really would like to own it wait a few months and it will be in the five buck bargain bin in no timethis game sucksany way you look at it it is completly stupidi was disapointed with the ps version of godzilla unleashed but with this version im beyond madits a total waste of moneyif you realy realy realy like godzilla then you might like itdefinitly one of the worst godzilla games everthe only reason it has the double smash sighn is because the first  letters are d and sits a good game to play then ignore for a while and come back to when you have nothing else to do
but its not engaging enough to hold your attention for too long
theres no customization except of the dungeon
there is definitely no replay value and when you get to the higher levels its annoying when you have to replay the lower levels of the dungeon because you have to have something in order to continoue on or fight your foe
graphics arent the greatest either but youd hope the storyline would help but it doesnt
just not the best gamemy copy of this game worked ok after some initial bugginess so i do not share the same concerns expressed by the earlier reviewi guess my concern is that even the fullyfunctional version is not highly playable
once you run through the play scenarios which honestly does not take all that long you end up in sandbox mode which is highly repetitive and does not contain many variationson the plus side the animations and graphics are fun and the diseases and equipment are witty tookeep your money in your pocket  at least until the developers come up with something much more variegated and playable than this isi played this game in storymode for a day or two
here are my main points of criticism there is an aerial view but you cant use it to place new rooms
 staff is hard to direct you cant just pick them up and place them where theyre needed
 the music is unimaginative and the assistants simslike jabbering very annoying
 you cant speed up a patients progress through the hospital by moving them up in the queue
 the cutscenes are too long and have little to do with what youre trying to accomplish
 you have no influence on how funds are spentall in all the game is rather unchallenging at least in storymode
you dont really have to manage the hospital
once you have built the required rooms and staffed it it basically runs itself although that might be different in other game modesalthough it is much older theme hospital is much more fun to play
i wish theyd come out with an updated versionbut a game
sure if it was done right horrible portmax res of x
what is this this was a great idea for a game and more time and effort should have been put into it
alt history games are really a blast
unfortunately i wish i would have passed this one byit is said that the road to hell is paved with the best intentions
that maybe explains why the road to gaming mediocrity is littered with the relics of games with high ambitions and low production success
unfortunately tpfol is the latest additioni am a sucker for alternative history games such as the exceptional warfront and iron storm so i really wanted to like tpfol
the story explores the repercussions of winston churchill actually getting killed when hit by a ny cab in  instead of surviving with a lifelong limp
consequently england never prepares for the nazi invasion and succumbs seven years later
but the nazi are insatiable
after consolidating their european conquests in  they together with their japanese allies invade the us
and this is our heros moment to shineyou fill the shoes of a blue collar worker who has fate drop on his head in the form of a german paratrooper
he kills him and grabs his weapon
the rest is up to you
from nyc to washington dc and from there on to london his place in history awaits himthe weapons from machine guns to tanks are a mix of old and new
the new are reconstructions of late wwii prototypes that never had the chance to actually be developed
and that together with the interesting background story concludes this games good pointscontrolling the above mentioned weapons is not an easy task and the learning curve never seems to leave the ground
every weapon handles differently  but not in any realistic or even logical way
heavier weapons should be harder to aim but exactly the opposite seems to be truegraphically the game is still inearly beta
i am being overly generous
this is a first person shooter  and yet every time your character uses a ladder a third person perspective creeps in  ruining any immersion achieved
your character can carry up to two guns  which nevertheless mysteriously disappear when the third person perspective appears
bad design pure and simpleboth the backgrounds and the environments as well as the explosions are well bellow par
and gore fans be warned no matter how many new holes you tore on the nazi bodies no blood will ever come out no there is no goretoggle option i checked
as to the bodies they disappear ala  fashionand do not get me started on clipping and stutteringall in all another overhyped game that fails to meet expectationsthis is a fun game to begin with
you run around finding minions who do your bidding out in the world while your character stands around pointing
but thenthings start to get annoying you cannot save your progress
there is an autosave function
it only works when you leave a mission
and when you returnyou have to replay the whole thing
just boring and feels like a waste of time your minions are hard to move about
yes theyre fun as an idea
but the only way to move them is by moving your mouse
they end up all over the place
clearly this was designed for game controllers and then adapted to pc and the irritation just keeps accumulatingso yes it is fun for a while and then it just gets annoying
i would not buy it againflat
its very much a game for twitch oriented shooter for a console targeted for a younger crowdjust about every thing from doom to halflife to crysis do both the game game genre and overall theme better
the story is  lacking for an author of barkers abilitiesthe idea of a squad is a bit of a joke there are no real squad elements in the game
plus there are enough console game elements and forced action to make someone without a ritalin iv and add feel old and slow
only until you realize it was forced action and designed to pump life into a dead spot in plot and game play
this is not a pc fps it is a console shooter
a poor port of a console shooterif you are here reading this review for the pc version
you can do better by a large margin with a number of releases that have come out the past  yearsran this on a  running vista ultimate with twin s for graphics
so ymmva horror themed fpsafter viewing the trailer i decided to purchase this game it the trailer had an interesting spooky doom  look to it
being a longtime fps fan i was cautiously optimistic however the game did not live up to my expectationslet me comment on some of the good and the badthe pros
smooth flowing graphics if you have the hardware and video card to run this game as it was meant to been played
also the ambient sound effects were well done adding to the creepy atmosphere
short levels with fairly frequent checkpoint saves
your team is composed of  different  members each with their own unique special abilities but these abilities are locked in and are not the rpg type where you can pick and choose between upgrades
the game has the interesting concept of allowing you to switch between characters to become any one of the other team members thus giving you the use of their special talents to help get through different situations
initially this looked intriguing butsee cons 
belowthe cons from minor to more important
you cant save the game except at game generated checkpoints
very linear game play
you must follow a tight specific path there is no other place to go because walls rubble ditches etc
hem you in
there are times in what appeared to be a short separate minigame when you must press the arrow keys on your keyboard  in a specific sequence to escape a situation and you keep repeating this exercise until you get it correct or you cant progress any further
this seemed senseless to me and had no real bearing on the gamebecause the colors textures were so uniformly muted and dark it was sometimes hard to tell in the heat of battle if you were shooting the enemy or your own teammate
although the game play from the trailer looked promising it was disappointing to say the least fighting techniques that initially seemed cool quickly became extremely repetitious kill the enemy move on kill the enemy etcminimal thinking required
this game features a team so youd naturally think a team concept for play would be used but yet in battle although you can switch to become one of your teammates to use his particular skills you have no real control over the rest your team players which leads into
my biggest concern with this game was the ai of your teammatesthere was none
in battles which tended to be intense and chaotic almost arcadelike in quality your fighters just stand there out in the open and fire away with the end resultthey get killed
standing behind cover for protection would never occur to this group of heroes dumb unrealistic aiconclusiona game that really looked promising but missed the mark
it had great graphics and good audio but just didnt deliver where it really countedin game play
i gave up on this game after about a dozen levels boring very repetitive and a frustrating teammate aithe game is great ifonce you can get it working
as it is an older game there is no longer any support for the game and actually caused some issues with my computer
the issues can be solved by creating a partition on your pc dedicated to this game as then it wont affect any other areas of your computer
to do this correctly tho you need to have quite a bit of computer knowledge
overall the game was great but because of the hassle of getting it to work you better make sure you know your computer before buying this gamethe spirit energy angle ruined it for me
would like to have spent more time in the adventure and less time looking for spirit energyafter watching a number of video reviews and previews for the game and after veiw the simply incredible screenshots i decieded i had to have this game
all the reviews and previews promised fasxt paced and innovative combat deep character customization and a large explorable game worldsimply none of this was trueto begin with the combat just doesnt feel right
it consists of simply clicking your opponent watching some rather cheesy combat animations and then trying to time your next click so that your character performs a combo
thats it
that is simply not innovative but rather repettive after the first few battlesnext comes the camera
where to begin
none of the camera angels feel right and all of them have defects
the up close camera constantly gets caught faces the wrong way or simply impossible to maneuver
the mid range camera is too far out making you miss out on the graphics while the even further out camera makes your character look like little more than an animated dotnext traveling
walking around in this game is problematic due to the camera which gets caughtload times
load times are ludicrous in length and ruin the feel of the gamethis game is simply not worth it i gave it two stars for the decent graphicsi am interested in why most people are happy with this game
i can not stand the combat it is for me a game killer
combat is as follows left click the mouse wait  seconds left click the mouse wait  seconds left click the mouse wait  secondsleft click the mouse crap clicked too soonleft click mouse oh lets cast a spell right click the mouseect ect
it ruins whatever else maybe good about it
its a rpg for dummies with half baked moral dilemas that everyone raves about seen them played them in much better packages not exactly ground breaking
if you think fable was a great game this one will make you happyif you prefer games like planescape torment i would avoid iti start this review with a confession  i havent finished the game yet
in fact ive only played through most of the quests outside vizima im not yet into the city proper
alledgedly the game picks up but im seriously running out of patience after investing many hours bored out of my skull
here are a list of observationsthe graphics engine is really lovely excepting a lot of random aliasing at night which i try to tell myself are fireflies and so are the sounds
the voice acting is above average but the conversations are often structured poorly and are therefore not believable
people offer the same dialog choices over and over even though previous conversations should have made them obsolete resulting in conversations that make no sense
especially annoying the conversation trees frequently dump you out when you intend to continue speaking so you have to click on a character again to hear hisher oddly identical opening phrases once more
this game ships with a hefty manual but it is amazing how little information is actually provided
like most recent game manuals its just installation instructions a pile of spoilers for those interested and not much else
this comes to your attention as you level up and find yourself navigating the most senseless skill tree of all time
prerequisites are unclear skill distinctions are unclear so what the heck why not just select them all at random
that will be really funso character customization is out the window
 hours into the game inventory has proven mostly useless so trading is equally uninteresting
gameplay is reduced to repetetive combat and walking from place to place waiting for the odd conversations to spawn new quests and or cutscenes
oh had i forgotten to mention the walking
the outdoor environments are relatively large and walking from point a to b happens essentially in realtime which again is insanely boring
never have i seen a game so desperately in need of a fast travel solution
top it all off with long fences your inability to jump over a fence or even step off a ledge without a staircase and the whole world becomes a big dull maze
when you do finally get to where your going the boredom theme reaches its apex  eternal load screens
everytime you enter or leave an indoor location youll see as many as four delays
the current screen will pause for a few seconds followed by a saving screen followed by a generic loading screen followed by i couldnt make this up a locationspecific loading screen
and each of these are longer than any loading screen ive seen in any video game ever
if you suffer through this only to find your destination less interesting than you hoped quite likely youll have to turn around and wait for it all over again just to go back outside
enjoyother niggles  if you expect the map to aid in your travels note that there are no notations on it
youll need to mouse over every location waiting for text to popup over its mysteriously identical dot markers
after youve waited a couple of seconds for it to  you guessed it  loadi could go on and on with the little niggles but in many ways the game is very polished
the real issues are pacing and the nearly meaningless skill tree
as for pacing how many hours are we expected to invest before a game begins to entertain or even make a point
i started to think about this during one of the minigames essentially rolling dice with the locals
i guess this is somewhat appropriate for a simulation of a boring rainy night in a medievel burb but you know ive got a playstation in the next room and could probably find something more fun to do
failing that maybe i could get some chores doneunless something miraculous happens in the next  minutes of gameplay im giving up on the witcher
even worse this is the sort of game that makes me wonder whether i still like rpgs after  years of considering them my genremaybe it is just that oblivion set the standard so high for rpg games but i am disappointed with this game
graphics are only average the game is pretty linear combat not that fun and much to my disappointment i just could not get into it
maybe you will have a different experience but i would be cautious about spending over fifty bucks for this game like i didi played this through chapter  and lost interest
there is alot to it and it kept my interest until i realized that some of the quests are outright boring
i really wanted to like this game but the dialog is boring
the dialog option you get to choose do not flow well with the conversation
the game is very buggy as well
save a lot because it will crash
there was a part when i just kept going up to this gate and i got some dialog and then the game camera was stuck i couldnt do anythingi gave up after that
it seems that developers need to fix a few things still as i am playing the newest version
the fun part is the fighting and building your character
the stat tree is kinda cool
making potions from herbs is cool
i wish they would have made more of a way to blacksmith
you only get to switch between  piece of armor
the game is just kinda boring
i bet it was pretty darn cool back in  thoughsomething not mentioned enough during the writers guild strike was that the difference between the deservedly successful terminator  and the deservedly flopped last action hero was their writing
one can have all the star power possible manage to incorporate a megaexplosion every sec enjoy more hype that can be handled  and yet fail to sell even matineacutees tickets if the writing is not up to pargames are not that different
visually and graphically beautiful games can fall flat on their face if not backed by a good story  see dawn of magic and dungeon siege ii
the club suffers not from story problems  because itdoes not pretend to have one worth mentioningin this thirdperson shooter one fights to survive the bloodsport organized by an elitist club of uberrich
assuming one of  characters each with his own story that led him to bloodlust with an interesting arsenal at his disposal this is a cross between a shooter and a racing game unless you keep shooting at and hitting your targets your bonus multipliers drop fast
unless you gain enough bonuses to augment your effectiveness there is no chance to winsimilar to most fastpaced shooters there are  single player game modes standard time attack survivor siege and run the gauntlet
sure all concepts have been done to death ever since ut  but that is not the clubs main problemgames are not exactly the same as movies
writing is important but if the gameplay suffers the whole effort is in vain
the club is another game clumsily ported from the xbox
similar to the gears of war the controls do not work well on a pc
moreover the environments are wellmade and mostly interactive ala strangehold manner but this in effect fails to add anything to the gamethis is a game that aimed to create an online multiplayer following
if unreal tournament iii a much better game failed to do so one can imagine what chances the club hasi gave up after the first  batttleslater i read a summary of the story and found it interesting
also i like the anime cutscenes
thats all the positive things i can say about this gamethe battle system is kinda like trails in the sky but much slower and simplerthe frequent switch between enemy phase and ally phase is very annoyingsome mechanics are frustrating
in trails in the sky you just click on an enemy
the character will move close to an enemy and attack
here you have to first select move then wait for the character to move then select attack
overall the battle system is just very slow and unenjoyablein terms of strategy games its kinda a lightweight
mainly you have three elements that are sorta like rockpaperscissors sola sun luna moon and stella star with sun weak to moon but strong to star etc
you can boost abilities or use techniques by equipping skills that you find in battle to slots or buy them in shops
theres a few problems though
the slots arent separate for abilities and skills so you need to choose between having heal and having defensive abilities
the mp meter fills each turn but always starts at  making battles a pain in terms of special abilities
but what made this thing ridiculous to the point that i quit playing was the limited turns system
you have a certain number of turns the battle is to be finished sometimes this makes sense but usually it really doesnt
ultimately i stopped around the point where i not only had ten turns but was supposed to protect these two soldiers on the other side of the field
soldier  died on the first enemy turn soldier  died at the beginning of my third turni like the anime style graphics but theyre often absurdly cute
the monsters shown in the opening scene the skeleton in the army looks like a lego style one and the big bad demon is just a dark shadow that possesses the prince who looks suspiciously more like a girl and here you thought jeanne was a crossdresser
the conversation is trite in places and inconsistent jeannes friend lianne is the only one in france apparently that has a noticeable accent
its certainly funny but not at all fun after the third battlewe didnt spend very long playing this game but what we did was not very compelling
beyond the gimmicks of being lego and star wars theres not much there
just running around repeating basic actions and poking things at random to see what you can do with almost no guidance about what youre supposed to be doing or how anything works
when theres nothing rewarding you you dont need a lot of frustration to stop playing and do something else
maybe a little more exploration would have revealed a great game but maybe not
didnt seem worth it to keep tryingi heard really good things about this game and i really wanted to like it
after about an hour of play time i grew disgusted on how bad the game mechanics were
id try to strike an enemy but end up facing a wall and fighting the wall
i mean really
the graphics were pretty decent for the most part but i hated the fact that the characters movements were very robot like
i couldnt even finish the game because i dont feel like spending k on a new tv
frustrating isnt even the word for this game
im just curious to know who tested the combat system before it was released and it passed
if it wasnt for this major flaw and a few other minor issues this game wouldnt be half bad
maybe it would be fun to play and now im real skeptical about playing unleashed  someday ill finish itsomeday but i doubt it
if you like dying repeatedly then this game is for you
if you wanna save your sanity then stay far away from this game as possiblei always wonder why star wars games for the most part end up being crap i mean some for sure are good but for the most part theyre either bad or barely slightly above average
with some notable exceptions of course which ill mention in a bitthis game fails in so many different ways there was so much potential in it but somehow at each point in the game where you smell the potential it somehow manages to not only disappear but you basically forget it was even there
the developers here succeeded in ruining almost every possible piece of this game that could have been fun and in many cases i dont understand why
lets go into the detailsthere is some good lets start with it first and get it out of the waygraphics game has generally attractive graphics may not up to par with some big dogs we have on the ps but it looks very well specially lightsaber effects as well as force effects
there are some levels though that seem kind of messy particularly the junk  jungle type of levels personally i felt the ship type levels were the most visually attractivestory the story is kind of simple but it works well some voice acting couldve been better i particularly found the main character dull and boring but overall it gets the job donenow with the badbrace yourselvesgameplay my my where to begin
how i hate you let me count the waysthere is just so many things wrong here its hard to focus on a single thing
for starters youre supposed to be this huge powerful sith and the force powers you acquire are supposed to reflect that but throughout the entire game you dont feel like one at all
even the most simple of enemies like the stormtroopers can kick your ass it just doesnt make sense at all with the power the game tries to establish
every hack and slash game has its share of low level and high level enemies in the case of god of war for example you have your share that give you trouble and you have your share that you mop the floor with but god of war manages to make you feel like the powerful being that you arenot here though here you slash at a storm trooper  times and he gets up you stab him with your saber and he gets up i mean what the hell and it only gets worse as your force powers increase
yes you have the amazing power to bring a star destroyer down with your bare hands but a storm trooper with some silly shield can take every force power you can throw at him
lighting force push grip nothing works on many these guys its like the game makes you a god and then sets everything up so your power is useless what the hell is the point of doing it thenevery part of this game that could have been fun ends up being ruined by extremely horrible design everything ends up being just unbearably frustrating not fun the star destroyer example above is one example one of the most horrible gaming experiences i have ever gone through
that particular piece couldve been made great but its just one of many things that end up getting screwed up and you just dont wanna have to go through it ever againanother thing that sucks big time is the fighting mechanics often youll find yourself dying and its not obvious at all how it happened youre slashing here slashing there and all of a sudden you see  percent of your life went away no explosion no nothing you died this happens very very often particularly in jedi fights where the mechanics are the most horriblethis is one of the places where the wasted potential is more obvious the fights dont make sense you cant even clearly tell when your opponent is blocking or not or if youre actually hitting him if youre being effective at all
jedi knight series is very old and even the fights there were much better than the ones here
what happened here
this is where the game needs to thrive
camera view also doesnt help herei could go on forever with the gameplay shortcomings of this game but let me move on to even another area where this games shines
and its bugs this game has many many bugs
they range from frustrating clipping problems all of the sudden you cant move and nothing is on your way sometimes you get frozen in mid air while you jump there are platforms youre supposed to be able to climb onto but when you try you keep slipping off over and over makes you think like you really cant get on there but you can  attempts later you do get on its just stupid
also when you pause and then unpause theres a small delay many times of  seconds for some reason before you can actually move unfortunately though enemies can move while youre frozen like a bitch so many times theyll end you in those  seconds
bosses vader for example sometimes freeze and you need to die in order to start over again
also ive died one or two times because when a real time video occurs of enemies coming into play sometimes they fire at me before the video is actually overso when it is youre already less than half healthdid they bother hiring testers for thisi could say much more but the above probably covers enough
thankfully the pain only cost  dollars for me but feel sorry for those who bought at full price
hopefully the sequel will improve this a lot much like assassins creed  was a huge improvement of the first one we shall find out soon enoughout of all the star wars games i have played this one is the worst
all of your force powers look better then in any movie
the secret apprentice is even stronger in this then he was in soul calibur iv
the controls are very responsive and make the apprentice seem realistic
the graphics make it seem like youre watching one of the movies
all of the characters are accurate to the star wars universe and the movies
but aside of that the game cannot be completed past the star destroyer level
you should only rent this game or you will waist your money on this incomplete impossible to finish gameif you are a star wars fan you have to buy but if you are going to buy just because the ps version was amazing just dont do it i would say the ps version was actually better than this one of course its the same plot but gameplay was diferent the way he defends really sucks you cant walk while you are defending as you could do in the ps version there is no jedi temple fights as there were a lot of them in the ps version it is just better in graphics but of course it is not what we are looking in a star wars gamei have the ps versionwhile the game is very fun i will admit the controls have been a problem throughout the game
i eventually made it to imperial felucia the thirdtothelast level when i ended up deleting my saved game
the battle with the bull rancor had me screaming at my tvthe targeting is bad
flat out bad
you cannot lock onto an enemy and stay locked
many many times i would try to attack only to turn and attack some random crate or rock
occasionally this would happen two or even three times against the same enemy and i would get whomped because i could not make the character turn and use force lightning or push on the enemy actually attacking himthis became a decisive factor in the bull rancor battle made even worse by camera clipping
i would try to turn the camera to face the rancor but the camera vantage would hit a tree or rock and reset to another direction
sometimes the camera would jump so many times that the character would just stagger about and i would have to find the rancor just to know which direction to attack
of course half the time it didnt matter as i would just force lightning or throw the saber at a skeleton or other random direction
the simple ability to hold a lock and force perspective on that lock would fix the problem but that never seemed to worki really liked the story but until i see that there is a bug fix patch i will not regret deleting a saved game three quarters finished and putting the game awayi bought this game last tuesday and let me say that i was not happy with the overall game
however thats based on the fact that i paid full price
heres my breakdownprosgraphics are awesome
very very sweetcustomize your lightsaberadd different abilities and change the color great conceptforce powers really well done
dont expect to beat this game just swinging your lightsaber
if you dont learn to use the force you will not get far and you will be miserable
using force grip charging the target with lightning and throwing it at groups of enemies was amongst the most enjoyable video game experiences ever for mecons too quick
i beat the game in  hours of gameplay and i was taking my timevery glitchy
i got caught in glitches about  times and had to reset
very annoying especially during boss fights spoiler alertltlttargeting sucks
especially on large objects
wait till you need to use the force to grab tie fighters in the second to last level you will know what misery really islack of imagination on the names
starkiller
juno eclipse
mammoth super star destroyer
are you kidding me spoiler alertltlt the ending
easily the most anticlimactic ending ive seen in a long time
are we supposed to believe that this guy who is capable of pulling an entire star destroyer down with force grip and can beat the crap out of vader and the emperor in backtoback battles is just gonna die the way he did
lameoverall i think this is a gaming experience that you should try especially star wars fans
but dont make the mistake of dropping  on it
you can very easily get all the value this game has to give by renting iti bought this at the now much reduced price and just completed the main story today
being a devout fan i will admit to being less than impressed by the story at first although i do think it improves towards the end particularly with the dialogue which starts off fairly horribly and gets a bit more coherent towards the final scenes
overall though i think the telling of this story could have been done very much better  especially as it affects the events in episode ivgraphics and environments are well done i thought although some levels are more boring than others felucia and raxus prime come to mindanother great thing is the sound and music  this definitely improved my enjoyment
all the classic soundbites are here the blaster fire from scout troopers and walkers alike the tractor beam powering down the saber duels
if youre playing this on surround sound turn up the volume because the audio stands outthats where the good ends though
im not sure who the game designers thought would be playing the final product but any pleb could have pointed out that theres probably a massive overlap between star wars fans and people that will play video games of star wars
so why the inconsistency in starkiller
he can pull down a star destroyer with the power of the force but he cant seem to deal with slow moving vader and cackling emperor with any degree of ease
he can double jump and dash through the air but he cant get up or roll out of the way after falling or being hit within  seconds
if youre going to create a compelling character at least lets build up to the final powerful product or at least give a reason for these strange weaknesses
i wasnt impressed with him as a protagonistthe game itself also has several shortcomings that annoyed me to no end unskippable cut scenes
why long load times  even when coming back from start menu operation
what is this a pc inaccurate hittargeting
try to force grip a soldier end up picking up the twisted metal door in front of him
repeat x overall  its worth a play through especially at the current price
once youre done though im not sure if youre going to play it againstar wars the force unleashed is a frustrating mess
meh
while playing it i encountered many glitches and game lockups
whats the opposite of game polish
i hoped that it would get better
but the enemy ai didnt change much throughout the game
appearances by favorites yoda and darth vader werent enough to salvage the game
you are better off skipping this onealthough i havent finished it yet im well into the game no idea how close to the end but with some exceptions ps games tend to be on the short side and have been through several sections when your magical abilities come into playthey ruin the game frankly
its a great idea  each member of the team has unique weapons and magic
it ruins the game for one simple reason  in almost every situation where youd like to make use of magic basically every fight things are happening so fast you dont have time to switch characters and cast
also most of the time half of them are knocked out before you even have the chance
with one characters armmounted minigun which should be a buttkicking weapon it takes  rounds to kill an enemy
and thats just the nonbosses
playing on easyit does look good
some complain the surroundings are a bit repetitive but you are in a desolate ruin not some nearly pristine relic site like in a tomb raider game so to me it fits
the enemies look good and are genuinely mean and the way a swarm of flies appears and whisks their corpses away was a pleasant surprise
its great for fans of the gore factor tooif this had teammates that dont die at the drop of a hat gave you a little more health to work with you die a lot and die and die and die again and again and ag and paused when you bring up the character select it would be a much better game
maybe it would even be better without the magic as a straight ahead shooter
in any case it simply fails to deliver on its conceptill definitely finish it or try to because it certainly does have its good points but wont be keeping it
the team system is badly flawed and what magic they do have isnt all that fun to use anyway
taken simply as a shooter theres nothing special about it
id say rent or buy on the cheapthe story involves the  member team jerichoa supernaturalbased special forces squad that goes to the desert to stop the evil lurking within it
its a solid story with decent graphics thats badly hampered by poor game development
i spent most of the time bringing my fallen comrades back to life and this really drags it down
it quickly grows very repetitive and tiresome
the visuals are pretty good but the backgrounds are mostly unimpressivelots of bland tunnels and stone corridors
although i read the bad reviews i like barkers writing quite a bit and wanted to give it a chance
it wasnt worth it
if youre interested and just have to play it do yourself a favor rent it and then go buy one of the many much better games out therethis is designed as a straight forward kids game but the controls are too difficult to master dewy falls off ledges and cliffs too often
the game becomes frustrating but the idea of a little raindrop changing forms to battle bad guys is pretty cool
this could have been a lot better if the motion controls usage was betterthe visuals are greatthe music is good and dewy is very cute but the controls are badyour always falling off the ledge wich makes this not as fun to playsome of the bosses are hard tooi had to have my brother beat some of themif the controls were better i would have given it  starsdue to the sliding around and bad controls it makes it very frustratingif you have hypertensionthis game will be hazardous to your healththis seemed to be a cool game but was a little too much conversation between characters and it wasnt what i was thinking it would be and i thought my kids could build rides of their choice
its boring honestly but i guess not bad for the price
my kids played it two or three times and havent touched it in over a year
we bought roller coaster tycoon  which more along the lines of what we wanted
i guess it depends on what you want to do with the game
if you want to create your own park place your rides anywhere you want make your own prices and need something for a very creative child this is not the game for you
try tycoon insteadthe thing crashes like  min into the game  everytime
if you dont save as soon as the guy is finally done talking when you are actually in the amusement park youll be sorry
we had to start a new game  picking my sons character and listening to the  min opening  times
finally did get it saved after my son went to bed tried a couple of the storyline missions and was about to save it again and it crashed as i was saving it
there are no directions anywhere online that i can find to fix this
nintendo does not even acknowledge that game crashes on thrillville is an issue despite it being mentioned on the forums of numerous websites
this is obviously very frustratinghowever the game seems really fun when you can actually get it to work
i thought it was fun to go around and tweak the rides talk to people and generally see after the amusement park
also instead of loading our saved game after the last time it froze up i went directly into the minigames and was able to play that for about  whole minutes with no crashes
have we turned the page  who knows  because of course no one wants to tell us how to fix the problem although ive asked lucas arts
the minigames are somewhat simplistic by vary enough in type and style to be enjoyable
a number of them require you to advance in your management role in order to unlock a game  pretty typical stuffso be aware  you are rolling the dice whether you will have thrillville or freezeville when you bring this home
i would not buy it online through ebay or from a store that does not allow returns
as it is office depot will only allow me to return it for the same title  so well either see if i can fix the problem or well see how many copies of the game hae the same issuei would not purchase this game unless you can find it used i will tell you why the multiplayer is awesome
have you ever wanted a game were just you and your buddy can have a exciting gun blazing duel
this is the game you really have to play it to see what i mean
i would not get this for the single player its horribly repetative and difficult
i bought this for about  bucks and love to fight off my friends in iti was excited to play this game but i pretty much ruined it for myself by downloading pictures of cards online
also the multiplayer was pretty bad because i think everyone did the same thing i did
now a days there are much better games on androidiosi got thepsp god of war entertainment pack  redas a warranty replacement for my originalpsp daxter entertainment pack  ice silver
i was looking forward to playing chains of olympus as this was my first experience with the series
i own a ps but never bothered to pick up the two console god of war titlesive played several psp games now and chains of olympus looks great
its possibly the bestlooking game for psp and as a result its a shame that ready at dawn will not be making any more for the system
however thats just about all chains of olympus has going for itthe storyline is subpar combining a weak understanding of greek mythology with a tired tale of deception and revenge
however this is an action game so story can be overlooked somewhat in favor of actual gameplay quality
the game is fun for a while but as you progress through the game you earn spells most of which are useless new moves and a new weapon
once you obtain these certain moves can be repeatedly spammed to kill just about everything including bosses
at this point the fun of the game slowly dies as this formulaic strategy nearly always works and is practically required to beat god mode the highest difficulty
there is no penalty for dying in the game which is good but before almost every boss fight there is an cutscene that cant be skipped
on higher difficulties this becomes very irritating as it may take several strategies before you figure out the boss achilles heelon completing the game which takes  hours at most you earn god mode and can take on special challenges that are at best repetitive and frustrating and at worst mindlessly easy
beating the challenges and the hardest difficulty unlock new costumes and a small amount of behindthescenes content very little of which is worth suffering through the same horrible plot and repetitive gameplay for not to mention that you would then have to play through the game a third time to enjoy the new costumes
i felt no compulsion to replay the game a third time and i only played a second time so i could unlock everythinganything below god mode difficulty the hardest is quite easy and god mode simply requires you to perform the same moves over and over again with better precision and timing than before
some of the challenges are also difficult but there isnt much of a sense of accomplishment after beating the hard ones as all you typically need to do is find out which special move fits the situation best and use it over and over again just like in the actual game
the game itself also contains a few puzzles but for students of actionadventure games with more difficult d puzzles such as any recent installment of the legend of zelda series theyre trivial and hardly worth mentioning useful only to break up the actioni dont think theres any reason to buy this game until its in the bargain bin or at the very least in the greatest hits series
better yet rent it and in a week youll get everything out of the game you could possibly want
with no online play and very limited unlockables the games replay value is near nonexistent
im glad i got it as a packin rather than paying full price for itits also worth mentioning for those with no familiarity with the series that this is not a game parents should be purchasing for young children
the brutal violence and small amount of nudity didnt turn me off at all but could be a bit disturbing for kidsi finish this game in  hours of game play is too easy and too short
the graphics are good but i like games with more play time
if im goin to spend  or  dolars on a game at least i want  or  hours of game play without get boring playingmy boys loved this game around the age of seven
as they have gotten older they have grown less interested in this gamei bought this game for my daughter and i we love playing the wii together we love wii sports carnival games mario party 
i find myself not believing that this game was just terrible for us
it was boring hard to figure out the controls which rarely seemed to work wellleaving you frustrated and either very hard or very easy
the fact you have to redo who you are everytime you change games is awful
plus waiting for all the scenes for the winnerughit offered us no workout at allunlike wii sportsunless we stayed with the same sport
if we wanted to change it seemed to take forever to do something else
after about  hours we gave up
i returned this luckily i bought it used
maybe this is a fun adult party game with a bunch of friends and a  pack or somethingbut for my daughter and i we just cant recommendsince ancient times the olympics have been about competition
for whatever reason when you play with more than one player in mario  sonic it will not save records or medals awarded
ie if you win a gold and set a new world records in sculling with two or more people playing at once none of these scores will be recorded
so much for competition competition brings the best out in people and nintendo failed to realize this which destroys a lot of the fun in competing and suceedingnot to mention no wifi play just uploading scores which is nice but these can only be viewed from the game itself
there is no way to check your scoring as in guitar hero save your money and buy the ds version of this at least you expect that on a smaller more inexpensive version of the gamepoor controls poor graphics poor voice acting there is some visual brilliance to be found but this is not the nights game we were all waiting fornights journey of dreams is a dissapointment in many ways
ive never played nights into dreams before so im new to the series
there are two stories you can play in wills dream and helens dream
both of them are pretty much the same
i hated both of them
nights is a strange character who flies around in circles
all of the characters especially nights had terrible voice coversgraphics dont be fooled by the pictures on the back of the box the cutscene graphics
at first you are introduced to beautiful jawdropping graphics but as soon as the cutscenes are over the game takes a turn for the worse
the graphics in the gameplay arent impressive at all
the graphics look like theyd be bad even for the gamecube
that is unacceptable for a wii game
sometimes the game is blury
sure there are bright colors but that is not enoughgameplay overall the gameplay just wasnt set up well
im sure it wouldnt be as bad if the camera angle was better
the camera should have been from the back of nights instead of the side of her
probably the worst part of the gameplay is the repetitiveness
flying around in circles as nights is very boring and who wants to spend their time chasing birds around in circles anyway
the boss battles are frusturating and are much harder than they need to be
i had no idea what to do on many of them
you also have a time limit on all of the levels and boss battles which stinks
if you fail a boss stage then you need to start the whole level over again
lamecontrols the game gives you the option to choose from four control options nunchuk remote gcube controller and classic controller
in a way this is good because you can choose which one you like the best but i thought they were all confusing
nights is harder to control than she should beto sum it up nights is a boring game that wasnt thought out very well with a dumb storyline and sloppy controls
ive never played the original nights before but im sure this must be a dissapointmenthaving enjoyed the first nights the few times i was able to play it and reading the considerable hype around the release mostly from nintendo power who seem to be fully blind to this games faultsi was excited for this release
what i found in this game was basically an onrails bird chasing game sure they throw in some other levels like an on rails octopus chasing level or twoactually the boss levels are fun and unique but they are over far too quickly and you are back to chasing birds around the levels may look lush and fun but you will be too busy chasing down birds to notice
there may be some neat places to explore and hidden items to find but you wont get to them you will be too busy chasing birds aroundif more of the game were like the boss fights or some of the other unique and fun levels it would be a great game or if there was time to really have some free roaming fun in the lush environments but there isnt you just have to chase birdsthis game is too difficult for children and too tedious for adults those with an irrational nostalgia for segas hey day yes im talking to you nintendo power might pretend this is a fun game but i was disappointed
rent before you buy the boss fights are really funi could understand guitar hero and rock band not having any non rock  roll songs
but singstar has no excuse with this kind of song selection since it is being marketed as a karaoke gameno motown no classics just bunch of songs that the guitar hero and rock band demographics might be familiar withi try to pick up multiplayer coop games to play with my nephew when he comes to visit and picked this one up from the bargain bin at a local retailer
it clearly says  players  onlineat least in the ps version there is no cooperative play
and the online play is nonexistent
literally if you go online there are no multiplayer games going
you can start one  and perhaps someone else will stumble in and join  but there is no community
furthermore the official community at communityfracturegamecom is a dead link  ie
the site no longer existsfor single player its not a bad game
the terrain changing has some neat effects on game play just be comfortable playing the game alone  or with someone else watching youthe game lacks a sense of viscerality when killing off enemies and the weapons that you use for kills are not all that exciting either
this game has the feel of something that was decided upon in a corporate boardroom while the environment altering weapons are kinda cool the shooting and killing part are very lacking and not all that satisfying
the ai seems like it is on crack in this game as they pretty much run all over the place and the scenarios for killing them is tediously repetitive
but what do you expect out of a less then  dollar gamethis game has overall great graphics and ok story
the problem of this game is the experience of the gameplay when you shoot the enemies you have to shoot like a  shots so you can hit them because the shots go everywhere but where they need to go
i misspent my money on thisthe good great catchy graphics and songsthe bad demanding precision makes playing extremely frustrating simple game play doesnt hold up passable downloadable trackswhile parappa was a huge success back in the s it doesnt hold up to todays standards
what mostly kills this game is its extreme difficulty due to the fact that it demands such precise timing
i found myself restarting the first level  times because you have to hit the button exactly when you need to unlike most rhythm gameswhile the songs and graphics are catchy and light hearted you dont care because the game is so difficult
the game doesnt have that many songs either and the downloadable ones are a waste of time
if you liked parappa back in the day then you might be disappointed now because it just doesnt hold upgame wasnt worth buying
it really sucked
i didnt like it at all
gave it to the children to playnot as good as the reviews maybe they are old or something the reviews either way i tried it did not like it neither did my grandsonwe were very excited when we got this game for our ds but from the first time we put it in we hated it
the graffics were very bad and the game was boring
if you get this game get it for xbox  or wii
both he xbox  and wii versions are greatim not a die hard gamer but i do own several systems nes playstation that type of thing
this game is not as near as fun as return of the jedi for the super nintendo or the pod race game for  im captivated by games like pac man and space invaders  so for people who like higher graphics and slower rpg games this is probably their type of game
not so fun for people who require continuous action
i like we can use  the force with their stylusfingers
maybe this game would be more fun for me if i played it on the wii and not the ds
sometimes certain elements get lost in the transition of systems
so ill give it another chance when i get it for the wii sometimethe nice feature is the easy switch between lego characters
some games one has to stop and switch through a menu
all  one does is communicate with the touch of a button
so that is a perk
when i got bored playing i would drop the characters off the side and watch them break apart
as i said kind of slow as you make itgot this for christmas it was really fun until a hour later then got boring 
i would not get if i was youbought for my yr grand daughter but it took my daughter several times to figure this game out
very difficult for young onesi dont recommend this remote unless you need the ir receiver so you can use a universal remote such as a harmony remote
the remote control that comes in this package is very cheap feeling and also does not give you that much control over your psunless you absolutely need the ir receiver i recommend thesony playstation  bluray disc remoteinstead
it gives you a ps button as well as additional buttons such as audiosubtitle and eject all buttons that the nyko remote does not have
also with the sony one you do not need any usb dongle plugged into the front of the ps which looks sorta of weirdwe had hoped that this battery pack woud work with our standard nyko charging station as we have  of them but they dont workarent compitable
i think this is par for nyko as i havent been able to buy a battery pack that will sustain recharges over the test of time and by the time you go to purchase a replacement battery pack you have to buy another charging station
in the long run were probably saving by not having to purchase batteries but its crazywii charger stat battery kit was order because my wii controller was working right
my wii controller still didnt work with the battery kit so it was a waste of moneyfirst off i should let you guys know that i own  of these
yes thats right  i had to buy  replacments for batteries
i originaly purchases these and the charge station back in  currenlty its year  only  battery has managed to survive
if you dont use the batteries fairly offen they just go stale
the only one left that still works for me is the p conroller battery
here are some pros  consconscolors are random
some batteries dont live as long as others
must recharge frequenlty
or prior to gameplayhave to move it around on the charger to get charge to take
if not used offen batteries that get removed after playing are cheaper
i use doller store batteries in mine nowprosif used offen saves money on batteries
adds a collored back strip to your controller to help distinguish your controllers from friends
charge simply by putting on chargeras some have already mentioned it does not fit elite correctly
you can force it by breaking off the inside piece inside the cooler but hey maybe its trying to tell you something  if you use it you void your warranty
dont believe me
call up microsoft and see for yourself
its easy to tell if you used it as well
so if you want to void the warranty and roll the dice then by all means
your xbox really doesnt need it if you just take xbox out and give it plenty of air and ventilation from all sides
i take my out and then put it back into the storage space after im doneand yes i bought this product
why did i buy it
when i bought my elite package i also bought about  accessories to go along with it and this was one of them
i was in a hurry so i didnt do much research
once i learned that it wont fit with my xbox i then did some research
while every other accessory works like a charm this is definitely the bottom of the barreli bought this product in  and started having issues with the fans about  year later
i stopped using it in  since it provided no value for my game console
i replace this unit with a different air coolerwhen i got this the first thing that i noticed is that all of the individual screws the plastic that the screws were on were broken
i would have given it a  star but the reason i gave it  is because even though the screws were broken i could still use this intercooler for about  weeks
then one day i heard a weird high pitched screeching sound in the back of my xbox  and quickly took it offthe fan is very loud compared to no fan and since the screws were broken i cant tighten them to fix the screeching noise so i cannot use it anymore
it was pretty useful while it lasted because it did keep the xbox cold but it was not worth the sound it gave offa good alternative to getting this item is to turn your xbox  vertical instead of laying on the ground
this was it would take days for it to overheat instead of just hours and you never scratch your disk putting it in unless you just jam it in recklesslyi wont try to explain the physics behind the problem just try the following experiment and you will regret putting the intercooler on the  get a copy of ninja gaiden why this game in particular
because lots of enemies in the screen simultaneously causes great stress on the drives and motherboard
try the game for a few stages with the intercooleryou will notice how cool to the touch your  is with this accessory
play through the same stages without the intercoolerseeing is believingi beg for anyone that performs this experiment and does not notice any difference to reply  i am pretty sure that no one will replymy intercooler arrived today but after a few excited moments i quickly realized that the problem wasnt my lack of upper arm strength but rather the intercooler having a plug interface that is not compatible with the power cord on the xbox the intercooler has a small bit of plastic in the center that will not allow  the power cord to be inserted
unwilling to break it off and risk having a bad unit im returning it as is
admittedly im nervous about some of the reviews here sighting broken machines though its hard to believe some of them when there are problems with early xbox s that could have been the issue
im just not willing to find out with my machine until i hear differently from reputable independent sources consumer reports anyonethe game is five stars and this is not a review of the game
first this is not amazons fault and they quickly shipped a second game within one day so bravo to amazon
this is however thq fault
i recieved the game and tried to install but the game was asking for a  digit key code for winter assault
the booklet only had a  digit key code for winter assault and so it was giving an invalid key code error and i could not install the the original warhammer or winter assaulti contacted thq and they informed me it was a missprint on the booklet and to send the game back to amazon for a replacement
amazon promptly sent me a new gameguess whatsame problem with only a  digit key code for winter assault and its asking for a  digit key code
again i called thq and again they said it was a missprint on the bookletnot all was lost i did get to load dark crusade which seems like a fun game but very dissapointed in the fact that  times i recieved defective game codes and could not load all  games
im giving it  stars due to the frustration of buying a game that is defective and having thq their is nothing they can do but have me return the game to amazon
i think thq should be reimbursing amazon for shipping coststhis is rediculousthq get your act togetherfollow up this is not a review of the warhammer platinum game pack however just to point out a widespread problem with the key codes issues thq is aware of this and acknowledges
also to give other possible warhammer players a heads up and to maybe buy locally in case you do have a key code problemamazon has taken great care of me with this issue twice now
although it would have been much easier to have purchased locally and been able to run back to the store to replace the gameroll the dice if you buy onlinebut just buy the game im having a blast playing the dark crusades portion of the game and cant wait to get the correct key code to be able to laod dawn of war and winter assaulthave funi bought this game a while ago because i finally submitted to the nerd part of me that said anything with giant robot battles is cool
sadly that was a bad decision on my nerd part
this game is identical to every other dynasty warriors game but with giant robots
also its way too hard to beat any levels
this game sucks and i sold it a long time agoin the past week since this review was written i have been checking out all the chess games available on the ds including ones not listed on amazoncom
this particular title seems rather popular but i suspect that is due to there only previously having been a limited amount of chess titles available for the ds at the timethere is a much better one from europe simply titled chess or schach if you where to play that one instead of this one as i have you would see that this particular version here called chessmaster really lacks in multiple options to keep you from getting tired of the game
however i much user friendly and simpler version has now been released on the ds under the title fritz chess where not only is the layout a little more userfriendly then this title you also have options to change the board colors and the look of the pieces
everything is customisable from wood marble stone gold  silver peices as well as even egyption and a few other different pieces to change it to as well as colors like blue red green and the usual brown and white or black and white etc for the board also in that other version if you select easy the computer ai really is easy and if you select more harder levels it gradually gets harder
unlike this version where i found on easy it still seemed pretty hard and i would not suggest that to a beginner who wants to learn how to play chess especially when it becomes frustrating that the computer ai is just set to stomp a mudhole in your rear end
i myself am not the greatest chess player but i do know a thing or two and i can tell you even after all the years i have been playing this particular title was not much fun and become irritating after a while with its supposed easy levels to start off withwhat also was a wtf moment the mini games
the first one is called fork my fruit where you move a queen piece to a position of the board to let it stop and shoot out forks and apples and oranges why
if i wanted to play something like that id get ataris greatest hits and play asteroids which is much more fun then having to go to a position to fire away on autopilot at for fruit
seriously
fruit
the rest of the minigames are locked and you have to complete a certain time or score in the first one to open the next sorry but this is chess if you the game designers have developed some rubbish additional garbage to a game that is no fun then chess players wonder wtf this is doing on the game in the first place then you the game designers try to make them suffer through each one just to open the next
its just not supposed to be one of those annoying type of games where you unlock about  minigames one by one and there is a slight chance someone somewhere might think its decent to play in other words the minigames are useless being on this gamei suppose maybe if you do want to learn to play chess you can read what other reviewers had to say about it and read about if it helped them or not but as someone who already does know how to play the game i really would not recommend this and i really do urge you to try and track down the other one i mentioned fritz chessit surprises me that chessscach hasnt had a u release yet but i assure you if you can track that game down it will play on your ds and is in english however that game is slightly better then chessmaster but i am much more inclined to recommend fritz chess as being the best ds chess game available so farthe other game i speak of also has some games you can watch of the best chess games on record and a few checkmate in  moves puzzleminigames which will really test your chess skills unlike the lack of something like that in this game here which included multiple boring and pointless minigames that will not improve anyones chess skillsi would only suggest you buy this game if you have no way of purchasing or refuse to use a credit card online etc and can not track chess or fritz chess down and also only if you find this title rather cheap because i do not think it is worth even half of what the ridicules prices of amazon sellers are asking for this title
if you run into any other chess titles be sure to avoid one called super fun chess which is not even listed on amazoncom because it was so bad and dont try to venture into any of those  in  or  alltime classics games unless you are a very good chess player and are decent enough to beat an ai that much like this game seems like it cheats to win even on easy difficultiesso to quit talking about the other games and specify on why i dont recommend this game
ai is too hard which is great for master players of chess but for a beginner to the casual players you will not enjoy losing every game
it may improve your skills that way but it is very frustrating and the ai should be made easier for people just starting out
lack of options both graphic and extras
although the ai is never easy you do figure out that the ai uses the same moves every time depending on which profile you go up against
its overrated and getting reviews better then it deserves due to people not having access or even knowing about the much better games of chess
so take it from someone who has played all known chess games on ds available so far
no wifithis isnt an fps as much as it was a hogans ally type of game
cheesey and corny dont even come close though kinda funny because it sounds and looks more like what you would find at an arcade with light guns
not worth the fps players timethe good feels just like an arcade game lots of unlockablesthe bad feels more like a demo than a full game not enough wiiness subpar graphics and audio no online playi heard about ghost squad a long time ago and i knew it was going to be a failure and i was right
the biggest disappointment with this game is theres only three levels
thats right
three whole levels
while the first two are easy the third is almost impossible to beat
the game plays light arcade light guns games of old and the zapper works really well here
while everything feels just like an arcade game its more like a sample than a whole gamei honestly felt like i was playing a demo more than anything
the only good thing about this game is the multiplayer
there really isnt much to say about this game really
the graphics arent very good the sound is pretty lame and theres not much wiiness as i like to say to the game
i wish this had online play but nopenot therei was really interested in a mystery type game with nancy drew in it especially since i grew up on the nancy drew mystery booksi guess i expected too much from this game  like more real clues and more sleuthing
after fiddling around with the repetitive games for several hours i decided to save the game and shut it down and couldnt find any way to save it
most games like this have a save feature
the manual wasnt any help eithera couple of days later i got back to it and it wanted to start all over again from the beginningugh
i havent touched it since
i figure ill trade it in at game stop next time i pass thereit wasnt what i had hoped for but children might find it more entertainingid love to see some good mind boggling mysteries with perhaps hercule poirot or sherlock holmes
even this nancy drew one would have been terrific if more thought had been put into itapparently it was designed for kids and not adults
oh well
i guess i suckered in for the nancy drew name and the interesting picture on the boxi picked up this game with a gift card as there was almost nothing else in the store that caught my eye and i was already a fan of the her interactive pc titles
initially i was hoping it would be more of the same but on a handheld console but i quickly discovered that ds is apparently code for dumbeddown stuff and why i had barely heard of it before seeing it at the storethe short of it is that the most difficult aspect of the game is possibly navigation as i had some minor difficulty getting nancy to go where i wanted
the story is linear to a fault with no deviation except the rare times nancy gets to walk between rooms to choose who to talk to next
solving problems is done via tenuously believable minigamesfor instance picking a lock involves clicking on dots that follow a keyshaped path and sneaking around without being seen involves standing in a slight amount of shade in an otherwise completely welllit area
its also not a very long game i finished the game in about an hour and change even without trying very hard to do iti think the ds has great potential for great pointandclick adventure games as games likehotel dusk room prove but this is a title that even kids might passsure the games might be better for younger audiences but theyll be lost on the story and the story alone isnt enough to hold older audiencesi was looking for a walkthrough for this game online
there arent any
after playing it i know whyi thought the human campaign was sort of fun and kind of easy once you learn that you can blow up all of your enemies with cannons
but after playing  missions into the orc campaign i couldnt take it anymoreconcept  make a real time strategy war game with heavy rpg elements so you can upgrade your armies and heroes
include  fully developed campaigns with approximately  missions each
include an online battle mode where you can create armies of humans dark elves high elves orcs chaos and skaven
this is a great idea on paper
what went wrong
story  the story for the human campaign and the beginning of the orc campaign are pretty good
they involve battle campaigns across a fantasy world
there are interesting characters and twists in the plot
if you enjoy fantasy you will like the storygraphics  aside from the beautifully rendered opening movies from each campaign the graphics are horrendous
i know this is a pc port and that were not talking assassins creed brotherhood or call of duty here but the graphics are ps qualitygameplay  there is a world map and you can choose to stop and equip your soldiers or continue on to a battlethere are two basic types of unitshero characters and soldiersheroes are a single unit with about  hit pointsthe soldiers are about  units arranged in a formation with  hit point eachthe heroes can be equipped with magic items that improve their stats and potions that replenish their health
on the battlefield they have lots of hit points and have three types of special abilities
combat abilities enable your hero to fight on the battle map
there are spells that improve your defense allow you to hit multiple enemies at a time  dueling abilities enable your hero to fight against an enemy hero  on   these are spells that only appear in hero vs hero duels
your hero can also be attached to a unit of troops an elf can join  archers
leadership abilities give the hero and everyone in that unit bonuses to hit move faster attack faster resist damage  as your heroes perform in battle they earn xp which is used to buy abilities on a skill tree
its best to figure out if your hero is going to be a warrior a duelist or a leader and equip them for that purposethe soldiers can be equipped with  types of improved armor  types of improved weapons and morale boosting banners that keep them from fleeing the battlefield
there are melee units like spearmen who are good against cavalry swordsmen who are good against spearmen and cavalry who are good against swordsmen
there are also troops that attack with ranged weapons like archers gunners muskets or cannonsonce you equip your army you can advance to the next missionmissions  there are assault missions defend missions siege missions duels and escort missions
all of the missions have a primary objective and some secondary objectives
to win complete the primary objective to gain more gold complete the secondary objectives
the missions also have conditions for failure
if your army dies you lose
if a hero dies you lose even though there is resurrection in the game fiction if your hero dies in battle you fail
this makes no sense to me  why cant the hero be resurrected just like everybody else on the battlefieldwhat you need to do is very clear most of the timebut sometimes you fail a mission because a hero character gets stuck somewhere and killedor your heroes are far apart on the map and you cant micromanage both of them at the same time and one diesor you arent exactly sure how to trigger an event in the mission and you failor you cant click on one of your units because it is surrounded by  other units who are all moving and fightingthere is no saving your game during or right before a battle so one of these little mistakes means that you have to play a  minute battle over againcontrols  failit is obvious that this game would be more fun with a mouse and keyboard
the control scheme often relies on moving around the map with one analog then pushing up down left or right with the other analog then pressing the right button a b x y to issue commands
so to select a hero hold down rt then push the left analog stick up then press y to cast a spell with that hero
to change a formation of units hold down rt push the dpad right then press b  it takes a long time to get used to but once you get used to it it isnt that bad
but when you combine the convoluted controls with trying to select a unit in the middle of a battle with a super sensitive mouse pointer controlled by an analog stick it becomes incredibly frustratinginterface  failthese are the most convoluted interface screens that i have seen
the game hates to give you the information that you need
if a new hero joins your party you must hold rt press the left stick down then press the back button to pause the game select skill tree from a menu highlight the skill icon then hold rt to see what it does
the game also assumes that you know about warhammer because it never teaches you anythingmaturity  teenthere is no sex or swearing
its basically like watching lord of the rings with really bad graphicsoverall  failavoid this game like herpes
play the pc version warhammer mark of chaos instead
i did finish the human campaign and it was kind of fun because the maps are fairly linear
the enemies only come at you from the front and you can weaken them with cannons
but in the orc campaign you are being attacked from everywhere and the controls arent responsive enough for you to save yourself from failingif you like games like this check out the total war series or other warhammer games on the pc
but there is no reason to play this game at alli bought this game for my nephew who is  and he played it over at my house
first offthe graphics in the first scene to start the game were great
they were like the pictures that amazon has shown
but then the game started and the graphics changed
on my parents standard tube tv they were horrible
on my plasma they were better but still not very good at all
and then the cutscenes during the games were hideouseven on my plasma
i have no idea why they wouldnt use the same type of graphics for all the cutscenes
now he hasnt played a whole lot of it bc he doesnt even like the game playbut maybe it includes some more good graphics laterthe game playso lousy
it was boring and so repetitive
it is a warbattle simand not a good one
granted like i said before he hasnt played very far into the game
but that was because he got so bored and disliked the graphics especially the horrible cutscenes that he had no desire to play it any further
ive played battle sims before and i couldnt even watch this one for very longthe voicesincredibly annoying
they repeat the same thing  times in a rowand the same voice cuts itself off
i had to turn the sound down while it was being played
and sometimes when they talkit looks like the old japanese voice overs where their mouths are moving and it doesnt go with the voices at all
it reminded me of old school video gamesand not good onesi would definitely recommend renting this game before you buy it
it may just save you 
or if you really want to buy it to try it definitely get it used
its not worth the full price at all
you can get it used for around  on ebay if nothing else i checked bc he disliked it so much he doesnt want to keep itwhy not allow saving during the mission
i had to turn this off because after the nd time i died right before the end of the mission im taken back to the very beginning of the mission
wtfrick n frack
i dont want to memorize missions i want to kill aiwas not impressed had this come out before wii resort then yea this would have been better rating
pass if you have wii resort alreadyin a gaming world that is inundated with shooters it takes something special for a game in the shooter genre to really stand out
army of two has an appealing idea the aggro systemthe game is designed to be played with a human partner coop as the title suggests
the aggro meter is basically an aggression meter
whoever has the most aggro is doing the most damage firing off the most rounds etc
will draw the enemy fire
this means you can coordinate attacks with your friend one draws the fire while the other can sneak around and take everybody out
the aggro system sounds like a good idea and it isthe problem is that everything surrounding the aggro style of play is flawedthe gameplay itself is frustrating
your accuracy while on the move is terriblemeanwhile enemies have no problems with their accuracy from even greater distances than you
accuracy while stationary and aiming is fine its just that standing still for long isnt a very healthy option
to add to this the thirdperson camera often doesnt do well when you are crouching behind cover or in close quarters areas especially when you are trying to swivel around to see if anyone is attacking you from behindthen we have the story and characters
salem and rios the two main characters are brainless brawny idiots
their wisecracking would be more appropriate amongst preteens at a skate park than two soldiers on a battlefield
and much of the story set in the middle east is not handled well at all
salem and rios poke fun and gripe about the army but it is all off base and inaccurate if we are supposing this is the realworld army their comments are targeting which it is
there are no civilians encountered in the gameit is populated entirely by badguy terrorists that perpetuate certain stereotypes and preconceptions that often made me wince
there is no feel of a real world in a game that is trying to address a realworld issuei tried playing this game with my roommate and then my brother
both times i couldnt get past all the problems i had with the game
my brother is a much bigger fan of shooters than i and even he lost interest
this game will be enjoyed mostly by the most hardcore shooter fans who want to check out the aggro systembeyond that there is not a whole lot of valueplay control makes or breaks firstperson shooter games
i like most of these types of games even though they come at a dime a dozen but this one is really terrible
first of all the play control is very weak
if a person with all the characters abilities could do something in real life with relative ease and a game makes this type of activity execution almost as easy for the character onscreen then i count it as a bonus for play control
but this is not the case at all with army of two for the players characters have trouble punching or shooting enemies right in front of them
controls are not intuitive in the least and the need for fastpaced battlefield decisions does not integrate well with characters abilities menussecondly the overtheshoulder perspective and a tiny target site makes it very difficult to aim at enemies and the contrast of the onscreen target site is absolutely deplorable
there is no way to lockon to a target and player characters abilities to fight in close quarters is downright embarrassing
when enemies are close players press a button and just sort of hope that their character will do something
it works about  of the time before the enemy shoots you or body slams youthirdly in many situations there is no way to clear a battlefield
enemies will keep regenerating in various stages if players mill around even if there is no realistic place that these enemies could have come from
lamefinally in my list of criticisms is the games stupid actions and unnecessarily vulgar dialogue
the characters make liberal use of the worst curse words in the book
its enough to make a sailor blush and it adds nothing to the games storyline or character development
its just there to be there and i got sick of it after a single gaming session
secondly the soldiers bro phraseology airguitar solos and fistbumps are reminiscent of what i would expect from a game designed by juniorhigh boys but not a reputable gaming scompany like electronic artshowever to the games credit it does offer a nice variety of weapons almost to a level that rivals metal gear solid  and the customization options are equally impressive
also the player characters body armor is very forgiving especially in the recruit and contractor modes
this almost makes up for the characters gumbylike movements and lack of abilities
lastly i think that electronic arts did a fair job at creating a video game that makes use of a twosoldier firstperson shooter that requires teamwork and syncopation
most dualscreen shooters dont offer such innovative coordination between playercharacters and that is worthy of mentionall told however i would recommend that people steer clear of the army of two series its just not worth the money or frustration when there are so many better shootergames for current gaming consoles
bottom line the characters are immature and the play control totally sucksthanks for reading mec lambethim really surprised by the high scores on this clunky shooter
the main mechanic of the game was a novel idea when it was first release you can play couch coop with a friend you duck cover and shoot
very reminiscent of gears of wararmy of two has an agro meter
the player that is being the most agressive by firing too much killing lots of enemies and even the type of weapon their using will determine the amount of agro they build up
thus the enemy ai
responds more aggressively to this player while pratically ignoring the other player that has agro
this agro feature allows for flanking maneuvers and allows for good strategic gameplay
at the same time it is limited by the level designs which are very linear
you can only go to certain paths on the game mapthe cover system in inconsistent
sometimes youll stick to cover
other times youll have a hard time hiding as your character doesnt seem to cling and instead youll slide out to get shot atto make matters worse
the shooting mechanic the main point of all shooters feels slow and clumsy
its frustrating to aim a spot and have the enemy move away because thats how slow it really is even on the highest control sensitivityalthough the music is very good the sound effects of all the gunfire sound very similar
thats just plain laziness on whomever did the sound effectsthe enemy ai
is rather competent other times it can be absolutely brain dead by not reacting to you even though you are in front of them or running in their general directionyoure partner ai
has the ability to heal you if your wounded but sometimes it will drag you into the line of fire resulting in both of your deaths
sometimes it gets preoccupied in shooting the enemy even though you order it to heal you
instead you will bleed out and die due to its stupidityplaying with your friend coop is almost a must so you dont have to experience that type of ai stupidity
and there are a couple of fun levels where you pilot a hover craft or that require that do a backtoback shooting frenzyusing the agro feature is even better when playing with a friend but it still has a finicky cover system slow aiming and shooting which really hinder the gameplaybecause of these major flaws i cannot recommend the purchase of army of two especially now that better coverbased shooters are available on ps including the two sequels army of two th day and devils cartelprosagro metercover based shootercouch coopweapon customizationconsclumsy controlsslow aimingall gunfire sound similarbrain dead ai
partnercover system is inconstantugly old school graphicsusually im a pretty good judge of games for my taste
i get somewhat of a sixth sense for a game that i feel i should pick up
i will tell ya what my spider sense failed me on this one
the game starts out ok and the premise is great
where the game fails is the purely in the execution
using aggro the main hook of the gameplay becomes stale as you have to use it about every single firefight
not to mention the aiming is terrible
i actually got to the point where i would rather just run up and melee the baddies as it seemed to be more effectivenot that im the best at shooter games actually i suck horribly but i still enjoy the good ones but this one definitely is not good
when the core mechanic of the gameplay is faulty how can you enjoy it
imagine a fighting game where punches and kicks are totally ineffective
sounds pretty crappy right
exactly
im sure there are people that will love this game for the coop but even that couldnt save it for me
rent first before you buyi dont want to waste my time saying too much but this game sucksthe graphics are horrible
i like the idea of army of two but it was just blandthe controls arent that good for a shooter game
the characters are not very interestingthe story iswhat is the story
army of two people being a revolutionary military thingi only bought it because it was cheap and i wanted to play a coop campaign game with my brother
what a dull experiencemaybe because it was released in 
that cant be rightwe both disliked the game and lost interest very quick
long story short i sold iti have played much better games than this
i thought it looked cool on the box but the graphics are subpar
the vocals are kindve annoying too as well
for some reason or another i just did not stay interested and am glad it only cost me 
this is a rental at best imo
there are much better games out there than this such as resistance and cod
spend your money on thatthe only thing i enjoyed about this game was being able to customize your weapons and the humor between the  characters
other than that it was just the same like every other fps rd person shooter
the cut scenes of opening door after door got real old tooafter playing cod its very difficult to play anything else without comparingthe graphics and the cut scenes in army of  are great
the story line is pretty good and the selection of weapons is coolbut thats about all i liked about it
the fact that you cant pick up enemy weapons on the fly is a bummer
the controls are crappy
it feels like your fighting against the controller the whole time
the targetting reticle sucks to say the leastthe game does have some merit but like a lot of games its rushed out sometimes to meet a deadline and the consumer ends up paying the price
good idea good story poor executionnormally i like to see games through until the end even if they are mediocre
i just ended up putting this one down out of boredom
army of two has all the elements to make a good game but they are all arranged and executed poorlyaot has a few key features and the game basically beats you in the head with them repeatedly
in fact if you dont play the game precisely how the developers intended you wont do very well
its really very constricting
the aggro system doesnt really translate into fun it translates into a monotonous repetitive sequence that you will be required to perform
a prime example of this the ridiculously useless except for specific parts coop sniping mode
traversing the game really is a matter of executing the exact same formula
all the main bosses require you basically flank them and then shoot them because they are invincible from the frontaiming your weapon doesnt seem to make it all that much more accurate and it usually takes an impressive number of shots to drop the average enemy
regularly i had to put two high caliber rounds into the average enemy grunts face even at very close rangethe voice acting and dialog are utter garbage and are physically irritating to have to suffer through
it isnt the foul language because im like a sailor with my colorful words but its just the idiotic content of their conversations
over and over again the basically same idiocyaot does have an interesting variation on the cover systems weve seen in these types of game  implied cover
anytime you are near cover and you try to shoot at something where the cover is in the way your character will move his gun around to clear the cover
its kind of fluid but there can be perspective issues
the environment therefore takes on that gears of war syndrome  where everything is pretty much full height crouching cover height or too round to utilizeoverall i would say it probably wouldnt be a bad rent but buying it is something id only consider if you really enjoyed renting it
or found it very for cheap and didnt have any other game on your plate
one last note  to be fair i never bothered to play it coop
i literally couldnt find anyone else interested for one and i dont really feel the addition of a human player would change how you played the game at all
the only benefit to a human player would be the social aspecttoo ridiculous not for me and i only brought it because my friend said it was super awesome and funthis game is the same thing over and over and over
run and shoot
the graphics are great
the dialogue is horrible to say the least and the game is extremely easy
you can literally get shot dozens and dozens of times before you go down and then your partnet can come and revive you
i mus have played through half the game on my first go before i finally died and that was because i wanted to see what it took to finally get killed
man i was disappointed with this crappy game
please spend you money of cod if you dont already have it if this game is worth  cod is worth  in comparisoni absolutely love first person shooter games
ive been an avid fan of them since the early days of doom
and i usually play them alli was excited when this game came out it sounded really interesting because of the coop
well save your moneywhile the graphics are not too bad and the storyline is at least average if not better the controls are absolutely horrible
in my opinion the thing that makes or breaks a fps is the ability to control your characters movement intuitively
having to snap back to back to keep a circle cleared may work really well in real life but it is so confusing in a game that i literally sold the game after playing it for  hours
i tried really hard to get into the controller and get used to it and im a pretty patient person but try as i did i just couldnt get good at the controlsmy advice is to rent this game first
try it out see if you are okay with the control layout before you invest your moneyi hope this was helpfularmy of two is a coop thirdperson coverandfire shooter which insists of two army soldiers named salem and rios that go on adventures to eliminate terrorists all around the world
you can pick either character and play through the game with that selected character
also the game includes a large variety of weapons to choose from ranging from submachine guns and assault rifles to miniguns and grenade launchers
not only can you choose your weapons but you can also customize them such as extending barrels magazines and stocks adding scopes and underbarrel attachments and choosing a paint scheme for your weapon
while its difficult to choose and customize what weapon you want its also the same when sitting behind cover and being shot at by triggerhappy terrorists armed with aks and rpgs
a special feature in this game is called aggro and what it does is when you are firing at the enemy the enemy focuses their attention to you rather than your partner
this gives your partner a good opportunity to flank or snipe the enemy clearing a path for both of you to continue your objective
its quite an impressive cooperative game nothing like ive ever seen before but it does have its flawsprosvisuals are pretty impressive for a  gamesounds are quite realisticthe variety of weapons and customization will keep the player occupiedthe idea of a twoman teambased game is rare nowadays in video gamesconsyour ai teammate can be a little idiotic at timesthe covering system isnt easy youd have to know when you are in cover and when youre notwhats the point of having only one vehicle when you cant even use the turretcontrols arent solid your character runs so fast you cant even crouch appropriately behind coversensitivity is so low that even i had to put it on high just to make it decenthonestly i liked the game
its not bad but it could use some work
i wish the teammate ai was a little smarter than the ones in brink out of  at bestholy ea fault batman
somebody needs to sue ea for false advertising
prostreet
sorry there is no street on the game
if anybody has seen those car commercials where someone is driving around and a disclaimer shows up  professional driver on a close course you will understand what it means when you play this game
there is no public driving in this game
everything is done on a closed course
ea needs to rename this game need for speed protrack
because thats what it is
competing with forza
why
nfs fans look forward to the arcade style racing
go faster than sound and crash into a wall without damage
that is the nfs we all want and enjoy
leave the realism to forza
let them monopolize the realistic racing games while nfs monopolizes the arcade style racing games
there are two things saving this game from getting one star from me  it is a member of the nfs series and it is very realistic
they did a good job of making it realistic its just the fact that it shouldnt be that made me so disappointed as a consumer and thus giving this game such a low rating
they also have a duplicate car in there
same specs on each car
the nissan gtr and the gtr prototype
they are both in there
ea missed out on one important thing with the realism when it comes to both of those cars  the faulty transmission
if you want a realistic car game dont buy this buy forza if you want a nfs game dont buy this buy carbon or most wanted
if you want a bad game with nearly no plot with cars in it this is the game for youthe concept is good and plays well except for the wii
the game is very hard later on and almost impossible to beat 
beating the game isself is not overly challenging just taking a few days of gameplayonce again ea proves that some things never change
case in point need for speed prostreet which continues the series long running tradition of street racing
this time around things actually do get changed up a bit at least it seems that way at first anyway
the games central storyline involving street racers talking trash and such is nowhere near as interesting as what weve seen in carbon and most wanted which is saying something
however youre not playing need for speed for story youre playing for racing action and you do get it with nfs prostreet but its nothing you havent played before or played better either
the race tracks arent very different from one another and the cars featured here have been seen before in previous games in the series
the racing itself is fine and the controls are solid as well and for a ps game the graphics arent too bad
it is also worth noting that there are two glaring omissions here that are nearly unforgivable
for starters the ps version of the game lacks any online functionality which is an expected disappointment but theres no police chases either
what was undoubtedly the best part of the past few nfs games was the police chases and their omission is just mind boggling
its also worth nothing that the ingame advertisements and product placements are all over the place here but then again this is ea so this isnt much of a surprise at all really now is it
all in all if youre still holding on to your ps and looking for some new street racing action need for speed prostreet is really all you have for now but even so you could still definitely do betterthis was a need for speed game
really
wow
this game sucked i was so excited to know that a new need for speed is coming out just in time of my birthday
i got it for my birthday and i played it and thought wow this game is nothing compared to what they said
dont waste your money on it i am a need for speed fan since the beginning and this was something different and now i have different thoughts about where this series is heading
this could change if undercover is good
please ea make a good need for speedthis game is fun when youre not waiting for it to loadsave
it seems like forevermy next gripe is the soundtrack
theres only a few terrible songs that get old fasti hate the locked cars
if i have the money let me buy itleave the drifting out next time
its cool in reallife not that cool but weak in video games
maybe i just dont get the concept or the appeal to drift racing
i was pleasantly surprised with the track variationim glad i rented itneed for speed has been dependable for a long long time
sure it was generic and we got one every year
this time it took a big u turn
every thing we liked in the past games are gone
just after  min the game get so boring you will never touch the controller again
probably it is a wii port up
cars looks good
environment all look like a wiips game
stay with carbon for nownfs underground  was a pretty fun game
yes the riceboi take on it was weak but all in all it was some good goofy fun
nfs carbon which followed was something of a disappointment though not exactly bad
but pro street was crapthe storyline was weak to the point of being nonexistent the racing was awkward much of the time the selection of cars was shamefully small and the rules for what cars could participate in what events was frankly nonsensicalif you want a proper racing game for the  get forza motorsport  it lacks a storyline which is actually less of an insult than pro streets vestigial story but has dozens of tracks hundreds of cars and just takes itself a lot more seriouslyi think its fair to say prostreet is almost as big a disappointment as carbon
most wanted brought us a great environment good albeit cheesy at times cop chases but most importantly a game that when you played it felt n smooth and creamy  opposed to choppy and slapped togetherbut lets quickly examine the pros car detail  the  and surely the ps as well pumps out some amazing detail
tread on tires creases on the panels and even the inside dash  cant go wrong car upgrades and tuning  very precise or so it seems
customize each aspect as you like it  and they even give you a test to estimate how you will function on the road
great for shaving split seconds off your race time works nicely with a racing wheelthe cons track racing  i think the most obvious downfall of track racing is the ease of  and over use of  using the same piece of track for about  different races
and prostreet does this perfectly  even when at different battle machines supposedly different geographic locations
and all the other cons with track racing follow too plain and similar backgrounds lack of excitement no traffic and certainly no cops
lastly nascar has some great tracks  boring in my opinion but many love it  which is probably better suited to the track lovers informational messages  im just plainly sick of eas tree hugging dont race messages this is a game not a defensive driving course  save it
i also imagine their dont race on the street message has something to do with the track racing the game is based on and their lame attempts to convey the gratification of local race track notoriety  bah
not so important but feels good to vent about
 car damage  im unsure if this is a good thing a bad thing or just out of balance
lets just say its not horribly hard to rack up a repair cost twice the value of the income from the race  especially since you pay when they hit you
they attempt to offset this with repair markers but the whole system feels off  decide for yourself cash or microsoft points
 so how do you want to spend your hard earned real life currency
if you have enough you can simply buy your car  and its upgrades
microsoft points are interchangeable with game cash the average car cost is about  msp  roughly  us
i imagine the question that ea answered with this feature was how can we make money off people renting the game
heck lets take it one step further exactly how much do you think the upgrades will cost in both game and real world currency for that car you couldnt afford in the first place
im guessing the real genius of this plot unfolds at precisely this point  when you realize you your ingame check book cant balance the costs and you start waving around your credit card for more msp no cops  but why should there be any
it was only the best feature of most wanted  and carbon took a stab at butchering this aspect by implementing nothing but straight roads where losing cops isnt realistic likely or even fun imo anyway
the cop chases which for me was the defining aspect of replay value  was probably replaced by the xbox live online portionso let me sum this game up quickly your driving your choice of many real world cars around a variety of tracks that pretty much all look the same you cross the finish line a few times as  you dominate a race day  which wins you a few bucks and a choice of  prizes  many of which partwise you probably already own mostly lvl for a while
when youre done you begin the same thing over  at a new battle machine with strikingly similar backgrounds but probably one major difference off the road is sand not dirt or dirt not a fenceno short cuts no speed breaker not entirely horrible mind you very little variety but great looking cars
are you ready
oeas mediocre machine has churned out another snoozefest with an abnormal amount of product placementyou are a potential client of many corporations
electronic arts lets you know this from the very first time you pop in the prostreet disc
yes there will be pandering
of course theres stereotyping of the import culture
its got everything you expect in a modern nfs game from an annoying announcer that wont shut up to a music selection consisting of only current pop songs
its obvious that the game was developed by a committee of suits who are using it simply as a mechanism of further salesi suppose theres an inad game in here as well
im not sure what ea was attempting to do in the game when it comes to car control and physics
it seems like the developers played a game with decent physics like forza  and then emulated it in the worst possible way
theres a poor mashup  of arcade and simulation physics in here and the result is an unsatisfying feel when driving
fwd cars will oversteer when you increase the throttle after turning off all the assists to do so requires a trip down a few menus
light to moderate braking doesnt lighten the tail of the vehicle as expected
unfortunately your choices for control range between simple button mashing and an uncontrollable messsome of the race modes are unfairly designed such as sector shootout
this is because whoever sets the fastest time on a particular section of the track gets all the points for that section
the problem is that you will always start at the pack of the pack and thus the lead ai vehicle will consume most of the points on the first run around the track
there are times when you will compete against vehicles significantly better or worse than your own car which makes the game feel cheap all aroundtheres a nice selection of cars but winning races doesnt earn you much money and thus you wont be able to afford them using ingame currency
which brings up another issue microtransactions ingame
when your car is damaged you can spend real money to repair it
if you want a new car or more modifications you can buy it using real money
i believe its fairly obvious why ea made it hard to earn ingame money
they want you to reach into your pocket and pull out a little bit more green
apparently shelling out the money for a video game up front isnt enough as now we are expected to pay to enjoy the game as wellid avoid this stinker and select something more enjoyablemy boy says the game has excellent graphics and really incredible sound affects on my psp but the game has only seven levels and finishes too quick
the game also didnt have any new guns and the amount of weapons is light and the game also doesnt  let you carry very much ammo and rating this  stars is being generous find a better gamedidnt worki think the steering wheel and pedals would be fun if it would be normal size
this is a very small steering wheel and the pedals are even smaller i think the dimensions where in the product info
but i dint check i paid like  for this item and i wouldnt pay 
before you get this make sure that you know this is a very small setfalls apart and very cheaply made
there is no medal in this thing at all everythings plastic so it breaksthey are nice and very well built but i am unable to fit the remotes into the slots without practically breaking them to do soi just got this at an after christmas sale and i dont think that its either necessary or useful
im sorry but ive found that these attachments dont really add value to your gameplay but may hinder you that is if remote even stays put
one of my remotes ended on tile floor
i guess if used properly this may not have happened but there were no instructions in the box
i have had my wii for almost a year and i have never dropped remote nor have any problems with just the using remote for sports games no attachments necessaryi was hoping to get a similar skin to the psyclone brand which are excellent skins however that is not how it is
first off these skins are not the same as pictured in the product advertisements
that isnt a very big deal however the pictures lead you to believe that youre going to get side grips
well you dont
second these skins dont grip as well as the psyclone skinsthese feel almost slick in your hands
thirdly they are not built as well
the psyclone skins are thick and feel durable
these are very thin and i felt as if they were going to break as i tried to fit them over the controllerin the end i took this skin off my controller and gave the others away
for the price they arent bad however there are better skins to be hadunfortunately its looking like the psyclone brand is no longer being soldfit on the controllers but is not good to play with it 
 
xdbetween frustrating and boring
its yet another game out of the mainstream setting wise post wwii i think
umthis low score i gave it might just be more of my preference
im more of a traditional wwii fps and this was a bit off that beaten path
i bought it out of desperation at a cheap price so no love lost
just too weird for me i guesssupernatural  military  weird
what can i say
i bought necrovision at the same time both out of desperation for something to do
into the goodwill bin it fliesthis game has lots of problems
first of all it doesnt explain very well whats going on  note i dont have the manual because i bought it as a download legal as the site i downloaded from was promoted on the official site for the game
things move very slowly   and a lot of the game is finding your way around rather than action  which is boring
the graphics also dont render very well  you can see right through the floor many places
the cutscenes also make no sense
a good idea and some fun but they should have spent more time making sure things work right and on the translation for the us marketi just played death to spies
it took forever to play
there is nothing new with this game
if you played other spy games especially the james bond from russia with love gameyou played this onewhen you play a new pc game you want a freshness or something you never seen before
this aint it
it has too much repeat action and you will bore quicklyrenttom clancys splinter cell double agentyou will enjoy yourself morebennet pomerantz audioworldit took forever and a day for this game to load and once it did i found the commands to be awkward to use and the gameplay to be far from engrossing
there is next to no flexibility in how the gameplay unfolds and as such it really didnt keep my interest engaged enough for me to go far with it
im glad i didnt pay money for thisim a bigger fan of straight first person shooters than of spy video games and this one just didnt win me overmy first comment on this game is that the control was very clunky
adjusting the mouse control i was still never able to get to a comfortable mouse speed
this made it very difficult for me to shoot people thus making the game nearly impossible even at the easy levelvisually there are much better games out there
the graphics are nice but not incredibly impressivethe ai is not impressive
when confronted with two enemies you can shoot one and the second will run around like  a chicken with its head cut off
if you just crouch down and wait and the chickenenemy hasnt spotted you he will return to where he started and just stand there
i tried sneaking past a group of soldiers and even though none had seen me the leader changed direction and walked right towards me until he spotted me
maybe he was psychicthe premise of the game is interesting enough and the missions sound like they should be interesting but i found them lackluster
i couldnt get past the control issueww themed games are in no short supply these days and the same goes for stealth games
so it was only a matter of time before someone thought to combine the two  the result is of course death to spiesthe game is hard to follow from the getgo  after a forced training session you are introduced to the story which seems to involve you either being debriefed or interrogated about former missions
you are a spy of some kind going behind enemy lines in ww era germany to achieve various objectiveseach level starts you out with a kit of weapons of your own choosing you can also let the game choose a default starting kit each level
on each level you will sneak by enemies to reach an objective such as a document that needs retrieving or a prisoner that needs liberating
you can sneak past guards or you can overwhelm one and change clothes with him allowing you to walk right past many of the guards undetected
you have a standard array of ww era weapons  machine guns grenades and pistols
you also have a silenced pistol which you can use to take out guards without drawing unwanted attention
also at your disposal is chloraform and choke wire with which you can also silently dispose of pesky guards
the graphics are nice enough employing the bloom effect that has become popular of late giving the game a look very reminiscent of brothers in armthe first couple of levels proceed decently enough but by the third level i was growing tired of the same basic gameplay and the infuriating controls
this game is murder when it comes to controlling our man
for starters you are meant to sneak up on guards and take them down silently  but to do so you must hit a particular button to go into sneak mode rather than just holding shift as other games might allow you to do
then you must hope your crawling pace will get you to said guard before he decides to turn to start walking again or someone else comes into view
and when you have to subdue a guard in motion forget about itwhen you do manage to get up to an unsuspecting guard you cant just hit one button to punch him  you have to hit the action button which then brings up a menu from which you have to scroll down to the action you want to take in this case stun and then hit action again
this is crazy  most of the time you are trying to hit the guard who has heard you and is starting to turn  the extra two seconds it takes to scroll through the menu means he will complete the turn and spot you
who thought of this control scheme
the same problem happens with opening doors
go up to the door press action select open door press action again
by then the guards you were trying to slip by have turned the corner and seen youonce you are spotted you might as well reload  two shots and youre dead
or which is more often the case the guards will throw a grenade at you  and they never miss with the grenadesin the outdoor missions these problems arent as pronounced because you can usually take the guards on one by one
but indoors is a different story  the guards will be in groups of five or more so getting them alone is out of the question
lob a grenade and they will scatter without taking any damage  and then sound the alarm which doubles the guardsso eventually you learn the only way to get through a level is to use the silenced pistol and kill from a distance
even then another guard will inevitably see the fallen body and come running
most of the time even if they are running straight at you they will always stop and look at the body for a second first which gives you time to try to pop them in the head as well
on the first level i took out  guards in one spot with this method  yawn what funof course you have nowhere near enough silenced bullets to take down every guard and again indoors they are too tightly packed to use it anyway
so ultimately id had enough and stopped playing on the third levelwith more userfriendly controls and a better ability to camoflauge yourself this might have been a fun game
but as it is i cant recommend it at alli loved tenkaichi  to death played it all the time and when i got it it was the pinnacle of dbz fighting games
when i heard tenkaichi  had even more characters i flipped out and bought iti liked it for about fifteen minutes and then i couldnt stand it anymorefirst off they drastically changed the controls for the most part
grabbing and tossing enemies or performing combos while grabbing were very easy to do in tenkaichi  but in  i never found out what the grab button was and even tried many combinations and every single button
maybe im just stupid but i kicked  at tenkaichi  then they change what i got used to and suddenly i sucki practiced and tried but even on the easy setting i got my  kicked about halfway through the game
to sum up ill do pros and conspros challenge
while very frustrating defeating enemies such as frieza was more satisfying than in tenkaichi  ill give it that
more characters
more stagesstory seemed to follow anime a little closer than consagain challenge is good until it makes you throw the controller which this game made me want to do many times
confusing itemupgrade system
tenkaichi  was very simple once you looked at it for  seconds
characters divided up too much such as  variants of adult goku and two child versions as opposed to one child goku and one adult that could go from normal all the way to super saiyan  and a super saiyan  goku
some say its good for matching super saiyan  goku with people like frieza so its more fair but tenkaichi  had a system that could limit the number of transformations
fighting modes are mediocre just didnt feel as simple epic or satisfying as korans tower in tenkaichi 
very buggy game crashed on me many timesid say stick to tenkaichi  unless youre the very patient typeim going to be straight here
i love dragonball z always and forever a huge fan including the fighting games
but this to me was not my type at alli started out playing the classic side view dbz games like budokai and budokai  which i loved aside from some stale aspects because the fighting was great
i decided to upgrade to tenkaichi  with this broad range of characters
unfortunately thats the only thing i liked about this gamethe gameplay on the other hand is absolutely annoying
i must have given this game like  chances on different occasions to see if i could shed light on this game
but nope i cant stand this type of gameplay and thats why i come to the conclusion that this type of game is not for everyone
to be more specific i found there to be way too many different moves that everyone has which defeats the purpose of different characters and the story mode is extremely difficult
i got past like the first fight but i had to claw my way through on the easy setting and the battles are so longi know many people who love tenkaichi  and this free roaming fighting style but not me
i got db burst limit for ps and love it but it doesnt have anywhere near the range of the characters that tenkaichi  has
so im still waiting for a dbz game with a combination of that as well as a much better fresh story mode
so if your really curious give this game a shot but i warn you dont expect it to be as everyone saysthey brought over all the characters you can think of gave everyone unique moves upped the graphics and included all the transformations but what makes this game bad is the d and wiimote
the ai is impossible and you have to memorize so many controls to be able to do anything it makes this game insufferably badif you have the time to learn the controls it might be fore you but if you just want a pick up and play title look elsewhereits difficult to control the cars and the many obstacles in the path of the included courses become frustrating very quickly
my older son who enjoys other racing games tired of this one after a few playsnot reccommendedreally for righthanded folks only
this game has a fairly unique control method on the ds so that if you are lefthanded you will have a difficult time with it
just a fair warning before you buy
there is a lefthanded mode to choose but i found it virtually impossible to play the gamepeople giving this  or  stars are out of their minds
i played it for a little over an hour then shelved it
i got it because it was dirt cheap and i love athf but the gameplay for this is horrible
its a mix of a poorly done golf game and a very poorly controlling action beat em up
its a little funny but enduring the game play for the jokes is just not worth it
save yourself the money and just pass on thisarguably the most popular original show to hit adult swim the aqua teen hunger force make their video game debut with aqua teen hunger force zombie ninja proam from midway for the ps
gameplay wise the game takes place on a golf course where you well play golf
in between shots though you fight off familiar enemies and race against the alien frat boys
none of these elements are really very fun at all and in all actuality come off as being more frustrating than anything else
the games controls are loose and unresponsive which only amplifies the frustration and the game itself isnt really very pretty to look at thanks to a sloppy frame rate
the constantly recycled dialogue gets real annoying after a while and even though theres cameos aplenty from familiar characters of the show there isnt really anything here that makes zombie ninja proam worth playing
the best part of the game is the fact that four episodes of the show are instantly available to watch which is sad considering this is a video game were talking about
then again should we really have expected anything less
the games overall presentation screams that its an ultra budget title and for the tag price youd be better off spending less on a season set on dvd
this may be worth a brief look for die hard aqua teen fans but even they should proceed with extreme cautioni enjoyed the first part of this game up until about level  then i started to see things i could have ignored if there hadnt been so many of themcons small doors that zone you to the next area that look like other doors that dont do anything
i dont know if theres only a few zones but it seemed that way no generally fun encounters
all i found were just cookie cutter creatures moreso than other mmos
everything just runs up to you and starts swinging and altering its defensive directions in a totally predictable manner
both dungeons i found just had  type of creature in each of them and that was it
no named encounters or strange things
the most unique thing an enemy did was not change its defensive direction in a predictable manner
they have a lot of potential with the active combat and defensive directions but didnt take advantage of it annoying map that doesnt show other group members until youre right next to them
they should have separated the command for the world map from the local map so i didnt have to open the local map everytime i opened the map after closing it with esc
or at least remember which map i had out last time i pulled it out
also the map should show all zone lines doors no matter how far you are from them since theres only  spot to go to the next area annoying instancing
give us the option to choose which instance we are going into since its such a big and obvious part of the game without having to go into the instance first then find a rez spot
imo instancing should be as invisible to the players as possible but since you cant do anything in a group if you form up in separate instances this would help newbies understand it betterpros awesome line of sight aggro
creatures facing me will aggro from farther away than one not facing me
this could be a great strategy when separating enemies but the call for help aggro is a little goofy great combat system
i love that you have to be active in it and cant just turn on autoattack and go afk
the defensive directions was a nice touch toothis game is the not the second coming of mmos which funcom or fans will like you to believe
this is perhaps the most overhyped mmo to come out in ages
we must give funcom marketing division a gold medal or something
they must really put it on their resume as to how they were able to make kids as well as even adults run and spend their  bucks on a broken game
a game which is either missing most of its hyped features or the majority of game features not even functioning as advertizedpretty much what you have is age of irritating instances age of tedious buttonmashing age of broken game mechanics age of missing features age of nonstop gankingage of crap in my view
i have uninstalled the game already and cancelled my sub as i cant justify me paying them for releasing the game the way its
i dont pay to play alphasorry
i might visit it  months down the roadthough i doubt it
either warhammer or wow expac wotlk sounds to be a much better deal than this half baked of a mmosave your  bucks i wish i didfirst off i do not want to sound like im complaining there is too much of that out there as it is lol  i simply want to state the factsthere is some pros and cons with this game and i just want every one to know what there getting for their money esp in this economyprosthis games highest quality is its graphics  hands down the graphics are its best quality the avitars you chose do not look overly cartoonishthis is a mature game so your playing with other adults  theres mild nudity and you dont have to watch what you saythe game requires skill to play this gamethe consi held off this long because i hoped things would change with patches and i didnt want to give anyone a bum scoop on the game
the game has very poor customer service  tried opening a ticket and it went unanswered for  days  then when they did answer it the gm sent me a mail telling me i wasnt online and canceled my ticket and said open another ticket to resolve issue i must be on line lol
buyer beware the game is loaded with major bugs  the patches have not been anything about fixing bugs only nerfing  buffing characters
the gathering profetions are very porly implemented all items in the gathering quests are set to rare that means you have everyone including higher lvl charecters in low lvl areas farming the monsters to get the items that  lower lvl toons not lvling
performance issues that they say they will fix hasnt come yet
guilds that want to go onto higher teir citys harasing lower lvl toons to get more into their guild to help them farm mats if not  not join them they gank you or kill all the npcs in the area so you cant lvl  lolthis game has allot of potential and wished it didnt have all the cons to itthis game really should have been beta teasted alot longer than it should have  i already reserved my copy of aion and will switch to that in oct funcom has a great game in theory just very poorly implementedi believe aoc will be a pretty good mmoeventually
every mmo starts out with bugs but funcom released a seriously buggy beta version and charged  bucks for it
i feel pretty badly cheated
a full  percent of the quests are broken and there arent too many to choose from especially in the  level ranges
theres a data leak that could drain lake erie
system requirements are pretty high especially if you group or raid
lag outs and crashes are far too common
banking is broken still and the pvp system that funcom raved about is atrocioushowever funcom was very smart and slick
they worked hard to get the first  levels pretty finished and polished and kept it mostly solo so those just starting the game or reviewing it would be impressed
but once you move out into the wide world everything begins to fall aparthigh end content is seriously lacking
i mean seriouslythe massive pvp is still very buggy and will bog down a pc powered by a fusion reactorcustomer service is simply missing
you are on your own
petitions will wait up to  hours for a response if the gm deems it even worth answering
emails receive a canned response that basically tells you figure it out for yourself
phone support will never be implemented according to funcomin other words this is another vanguard saga of heroes
great concept with some excellent storylines graphics and gameplayuntil you get past level   then you see what is missingthe game is also easy
you can solo all the way to the top in about a month if you push it
maybe two for casual playon a more basic level the game is not really my kind of mmo
combat is frenetic and fast
this kills any sort of communication or social interaction when in a group
often you are far too busy executing combos to chat with anyone be it a tell or guild chat
and no matter how interesting combat is once you grind enough it will get repetitive and boring
it just requires a lot of concentration and interaction so you cant chat to relieve the boredombeing able to solo means not many people group
theres no real incentive to do so
and unless you have to group its very hard to find a groupon the positive side the combat is interesting for a while
the m rating is fun with light nudity mild cursing and buckets of gore
some of the fatalities are immensely amusing and satisfying
the graphics are excellent and animations are quite good
sound quality is exemplary
when quests work they are usually worth doing and the storylines behind them are wellconstructed and engaging
voiceovers which only exist in the first  levels are quite goodagain though the good points are only good when they work
crashing during combat makes it very not fun
video bugs and data leaks destroy immersion quickly
broken quests are extremely frustrating and big timewasters
funcoms utter silence on the customer service front is also extremely annoyingst person view is most definitely not the best thing to do from a tactical standpoint
you cant see visual cues you have to see for combat when in first person
its like they threw it in as an afterthought but forgot about it and really dont expect anyone to use it
st person view means a lot to me as a player because it really helps with immersionthe bottom line is that you should wait a good  months for the game to be fixed
if theres any sort of population left after that time it might be a pretty good mmoanyone who remembers the launch of anarchy online knows what a debacle it was
broken infrastructure missing features persistant bugs massive downtime and nonexistant customer service
sadly it seems funcomm learned nothing from the experience
the repition of all launches are like this from funcomm and its supporters are getting tiresome since i can think of at least four major mmorpg launches in the last few years that were virtually trouble freeif age of conan actually provided everything it claims to it would be a fivestar game
possibly six months from now it will be an awesome game and a wonderful immersive experience
but if you buy this game now youre paying a funcomm to beta test their product when it should be the other way aroundtheres certainly nothing here that has me rushing to cancel my lord of the rings online subscription
if youre waiting for a wow killer this aint iti wont include any specifics for reasons to purchase or choose to avoid this game since so many others have done so
however i will say that this game is initially a great deal of fun but quickly tapers off as you climb the levels
after a good amount of patching and player observation is done im sure this game will be a decent hit
for now you either decide to wade through half a year of unenjoyable content or wait
your choicei had seen some screenshot of the game and i am pretty sure it is a good game although i never really got to play iti purchased it not knowing i had to pay monthly to play it which is not the type of game i am looking for
for if you are planning to buy this game best believe youll have to pay extra money to play iti was hoping this would last but stopped charging my controllers only after a few months
so i was a bit disappointedi really dont care for this charger or any of the others with the prong connection
my son already broke it trying to pull the controller off
the magnetic one by niko is much better and easier as welli was really really looking for this thing to play call of duty black ops and i found out that this is useless
it wont respond all the time which makes it very frustrating
i tried uncharted  but forget it
i am waiting for socom  next month and if this splitfish shark dont work well then im selling it right away
killzone  works pretty good but sometime aiming down during shooting is not responding accuratelythis product is ok but i honestly found it much easier to use the controller
i am a big pc gamer so i went in expecting a comparable experience and i as sorely disappointed
small movements are impossible no matter how you configure it and it is not possible to whip around and do a  you can only go as fast as the sensitivity in the game allowswhats with the extra tiny button for synching the controller to the xbox
why do other wireless devices succeed without this button
why does the ps wireless controller have nice rechargable batteries that charge off the usb port and this one doesnt
inquiring minds want to knowthe size is nice though
i still think thegamester usa fps master for playstation is the best controller ever end of discussion and im trying to build a setup to use this controller with xbox   hopefully it will worksincerelyira carmelfive minutes for a cool  points no game can touch that recordif youre an achievement junkie you probably already know about this one but if not avatar has five achievements based around a hit counter
you get points each time you add  hits to your counter and said counter resets each time you get hit
in the very first level of the game you can easily obtain all five achievementswill kids like it
probably i dont know
i review with the achiever in mindgo forth and unlockthe goodthe game is phenomenal with graphics even for created superstars
the movelist is sensational and tremendous
theres even moves youll never see in the wwe such as the canadian destroyer asai ddt shooting star press and others
the setup of wrestler classes provides for some fun pseudofinisher bonuses like the powerhouse rampage or the showstopper finisher stealer and make for more interesting playtheres an intensely big variety of matches and some innovative ways of building up your created superstar to a score of  the highest wwe superstar is john cena with  the lowest snitsky and shane mcmahon with  and the divas are below the badfor one what really killed my momentum as a new player was the reversing of the trigger buttons for the gamecube r was to reverse strikes l was to reverse grapples
its reversed here
as well button mashing appears to be the same disoriented mess that it was in day of reckoning  that is it tries not to encourage button mashing but doesnt really have any other option perhaps slowly mashing the buttons
it doesnt even really matter because your chances of getting up quickly after just one hit are far slimmer than they would be in dori was amazed amused and annoyed when starting with wwf wrestlemania x you could break up moves in progress by attacking the people involved or hitting them with your grapple move
more like wwf wrestlemania  or no mercy this game undos thatyou cannot break up grapple moves in progress at all in this game
even breaking up pins or submissions is a sloppy affair which may or may not even worki played and owned wwe smackdown vs raw  and thought it was great
 takes away a great concept stamina recharge
in  you could press and hold a button to regenerate stamina after some brutal bouting
in  you dont you just have to stand around doing nothing to build it back up just like in dorthe struggle submission system is just an absolute mess
about the only struggle in this submission system is the struggle of smashing the control stick with your palm to get it to break you loose
because theyve only just substituted buttonmashing a with buttonmashing the control stick side to side
even then it appears to be a crapshoot as to whether ill break out of a submission hold early
i cant even see or have control over submitting
whereas in previous games a bar would show you how close you are to submitting in this game it doesnt tell you jack just leaving you to smash the stick around and pray you dont randomly submiti dont know when this started in the smackdown vs raw franchise but having been a veteran of wwf wrestlemania  all the way to wwe day of reckoning  it came as an utter shock in svr and continued in svr of pretty pathetic sexism on the wwes part as women are not allowed to wrestle in any match that isnt a normal iron man or submission match
that means no women flying off the top of steel cages no women prying the womens championship belt from the top of a ladder no women backstage in the parking lotargue all you want that the wwe doesnt show that anyway but they have had it happen before and theyve let women wrestlers do it as recently as  in wwe day of reckoning rather unlike dor and dor the certain chainwrestling feel of the game is completely eliminated here in favor of stilted action featuring strikes and grapples unable to be interrupted save for with generic reversals and counters which could not for the life of them pass off as chainwrestling
its clearly a brawlerpowerhouses game as the advantages of a technical or submission wrestler or high flyer are pretty much nonexistanta higher level high flyer or technical wrestler of equal skill to a lower level powerhouse or brawler will always lose because the pretty moves are nowhere near as effective as the effective movesand in fact
that is exactly what it does
playing the game on xbox live is utter hell as the vast majority of players are the kind who soup up their custom characters to level  give them generic names like killa or dx demon or thug face mugger in all caps either being the most boring generic john cena lookalikes or obnoxiously dressed like the insane clown posse in neon green hoodies
and virtually all the players are brawler or hardcore slash powerhousesbecause being a powerhouse gives you the ability rampage which makes all your grapples unreversable and makes you autorever all grapples done to youyou can see the destruction begin just with thatunless you play with friends or manage to find the one rarity that plays at your level or bothers to actually wrestle youll pretty much be outright fightingnot wrestling
it seems every random asshole mentioned above will fill their movelist solely with the easiest to use spears big boots running stos and other hard and generic slams and will immediately rush at you to do a running spear or running sto and proceed to do nothing but these moves directly on you until they fill their momentum bar use rampage ability continue to do the same and pin you
the absolute worst of these will do nothing but their running grapplesspears or running stosthis pretty much renders online wrestling impossible
youll just be online fightingin svr i was blown away by not only the variety but the creativity in choice of legends
you can unlock perennial favorites like stone cold steve austin the rock and mick foley but you can also unlock all three of foleys faces cactus jack mankind dude love the american dream dusty rhodes eddie guerrero hulk hogan bam bam bigelow jerry lawler jim neidhart roddy piper taz bret hart mr perfect etcetera
that is one hell of an impressive legends roster and big enough to fill wwecws roster on scifi
imagine reenacting the classic bouts between bam bam bigelow and taz from living dangerously  and heatwave in svr the legends roster is back to status quo stone cold steve austin the rock mick foley roddy piper bret hart
the only fun new additions are rick rude and terry funkas for the roster its actually more accurate in reflecting the wwes roster at the time of its releaserazor thinsvr had a far wider variety and size in its roster including several superstars who remained and remain contracted to the wwe and on wwe tv but were apparently not good enough to fit in the already undersized wwe svr rosterthe roster is missing jillian hall the boogeyman lance cade trevor murdoch paul london brian kendrick hardcore holly super crazy shelton benjamin charlie haas kevin thorn nunzio little guido viscera big daddy v matt striker the miz thank god john morrison note hes actually in the game but still as johnny nitro balls mahoney deuce and domino etceterathe roster includes chris masters the sandman sabu and king booker
these four were released well before the game was released and considering how they rushed to remove all traces of chris benoit from the game they probably kept these four in to keep the roster from being completely and totally boring
how much fun can you have with kennedy kennedy and elijah burke vs snitsky and chavo guerrero compared to paul london and brian kendrick vs shelton benjamin and balls mahoneyalmost the most insulting of all is the score level
as i mentioned above you can train your character up to be  and the wwe superstars have preset scores
these numbers represent their skills in strength speed hardcore charisma stamina durability technical prowess and submissionso how insulting it is for wwe legends that john effing cena the  moves of doom wonder rates the highest in the game over the likes of ric flair at a piddling  or terry funk at a flimsy in the end this edition stands as a flimsy paycheck game release
that is a game rushed to production solely for the sake of making money and updating their rosteri feel like im usually lenient when it comes to rating many wwe games as im a  fan of most of them but this would have to be an exception
it was the first game to be released on the ps nintendo ds and the wii
this was the first game to feature ecw as ecw had recently been resurrected and brought back to tvbecause this game featured ecw a ton of ecw superstars were making their wwe game debut such as elijah burke kelly kelly marcus cor von cm punk sandman sabu and tommy dreamer his actual first game was wwe raw 
i was extremely disappointed not to see other ecw superstars such as kevin thorn ariel mike knox and test make the cut
regular wwe superstars making their game debut included cryme tyme ashley mvp and kenny dykstra
a lot of legends from svr  made their return to the roster in  the only new ones were rick rude sgt
slaughter and terry funk new superstar fighting styles were introduced to the game that featured either highflyer powerhouse hardcore brawler submission artist technical showman or dirty
every superstar and diva came with at least  of the fighting styles that would benefit them somehow in the matchthe backstage brawl that had been in the last  smackdown vs raw games was now gone
the only new match type was the extreme rules match to go with the ecw addition to the game
it was a rather cool match that had a lot of retro ecw riding on it as you could snatch weapons from the fans at ringside and even set weapons on fire like the x wrapped in barbed wire and a table
another new feature was the tournament mode which allowed you to create either a king of the ring money in the bank or beat the clock tournamentfor whatever reason season mode was dubbed  mode and the focus was all about having the superstar you play as reach legendary status
let me just say that this may very well be the worst season mode in the history of wwe games
its worse than just bring its season mode and probably even worse than raw s season mode
its extremely boring
for starters for  of the season youre either feuding with the mcmahons of ecw
its like the producers thought itd be a fun idea to constantly have you fighting the mcmahon family or ecw the entire season but it was a horrible idea
on top of that  of the cutscenes in the season mode are repetitive
every week will either open with you shaking hands with superstars backstage lifting weights or accidentally walking into the divas locker room
sometimes when youre on your way to the ring a random superstar will attack you from behind and bust you open with a steel chairyet when the match starts youre not even bleeding
and then after a match youll either faint and be carried out on a stretcher or get into an argument with your opponent
redundant cutscenes that dont add hype to any of the stories youre in
thq was really lazy with this season mode
they should be ashamed for how horrible and boring it wasoverall one of my least favorite wwe games and probably my only least favorite
 mode was boring they took out backstage brawls and replaced it with extreme rules but you could only have so many matches before it got tiring
there were no more diva gimmick based matches and this would be the last game to feature a buried alive match
just to sum it up save your money and skip this game
youre not missing out on anything special
thqyukes didnt care about trying to make this game even semidecent and lazily put it together
therefore you shouldnt spend your money on this crappy productthe series is no longer aimed at the older gamer
in an attempt to simplify the controls they instead made them overly complicated
svr had  front grapples svr has  why the step backwards
why does a ps game from  offer more customization with more moves than a xbox  title
what was wrong with manual targeting that they had to completely remove it
why can you still throw someone outside and apply unblockable headlock after unblockable headlock
why did they change the animation for this but not fix the unblockable glitchany long time smackdown fans will ask themselves these questions and more
this is not a fun ride at all
youre forced into playing the way yukes wants you to not the way you want to
either you use the analog sticks or you dont play
either you hope manual targeting works it usually doesnt or you dont playone scroll through of the roster will confirm my previous statement about this game being for children
all of the wrestlers are stacked in attributes with no real weaknesses present and half of them have a championshipthe biggest problem with this game are the fighting styles
they took things from previous games that everyone could do and separated them into categories
to make the kids happy they added features that allow you to make your character invincible to strikes grapples submissions and pinfallsunlike in previous titles theres no strategy in this version of svr
it s a race to the finish
a race filled with glitches cheapness and overpowered brutes with unblockable abilitiesrecommended only for hyper little children with a short attention span and no skill beyond repeatedly mashing buttons and flicking analog sticks like actors do in sitcoms when their character is supposed to be playing a video gamethe naruto series of games will most likely evolve along the lines of the dragon ball series of game which is a good thing
this fighter while frantic and fun at times is not quite a mature fighting game yetprosalmost all of your favorite characters from the seriesmany signature jutsus present and with interesting animationswhile simplified combat and combo system are responsive and characters are evenly balancedconsoversimplified controls leads to stale gameplay
what good is  characters if they all control the same
only two attack buttons and a single button for jutsus make each fighter feel the samestory mode is simplified and rather dissapointing
if you liked the series the story mode is a bad retelling of it and if youre new to the series the story mode wont give you any of the excitement the show does
at least the dbz games make more effort to include the action of the show in the story modejutsus are dissapointing and add little strategy
each character usually has one jutsu accomplished by pressing one button which connects in the same way with an initial strike needing to land
no jutsus used as a counter shikamaru or narutos rasengan would be ideal for this no long distance jutsus temari and tenten would be ideal for this no projectile jutsus kankuros poison needles
nope
gaaras sand shuriken
nope
everybody needs to get in close and land their jutsu like a punch
boringno depth of game playclash of ninja revolution is too oversimplified to be anything but a rental
the initial fun of pounding out simple combos and jutsus and unlocking new characters dissapears once you realize that the characters all feel the same and have the same strategies bang away with preset combos till your meter is full then add a jutsu at the end of a combo to win
even the special missions where you need to finish an oppenent with a specific move can be accomplished in one or two triesoverall fighting game fans will find this to be cotton candy not a nice juicy steaki thought the st soldier of fortune was a pretty good game
the nd wasnt that hot
the rd payback is pretty awful
for one thing it is too short
you can play it in  hours
it is basically pretty cheesey and a somewhat waste of time
it should be priced at around 
i cant understand why they even released itthis is a very basic fps with very long load times and alot of unlockable weapons that open as you complete missions
the problem is that while the controls arent broken they are just so basic as are the environments that you can help but stave off the yawns as you split apart the bodies of your foes with some fairly cool and powerful weapons
sof payback is also following on the heels of cod which has set a new standard for fps gaming
the graphics are mediocre the gameplay is nothing more than shooting one villian after another with occasional demoltion missions
boring generic and too late to the party this game is almost guaranteed to disappoint in practically every facet my advice is try out every other next gen fps before you give this one a shot as i suspect it might be the bottom of the barreli rented this game from blockbuster thank goodness
the idea was alright graphics average but the controls were awful and sluggish
it didnt seem to matter which car you picked because they all drove the samea few things about the game the controls are horrible steering is poor at best
i can never win a race or let alone have a chance of winning because of the oversteer on these trucks
im  and me and my son whose  play this game he has fun driving around and wrecking things
as far as racing he doesnt know any betterthis is not as easy to play as it looks
first of all you cant treat it like youre in a race car because if you go fast youll lose control
you have to go extra slow in order to make your turns
i found that the padded sticker on the wheel causes glue streaks on the remote control sensor
when i play other games the streaks marks would cause problem wthe remote being recognize
i want to send it back
i dont know if its just a defective one or is it just the way they are
my little boy likes it even though hes almost three
he can make it spin and he likes monster trucks for this reason i give it two out of fiveit was amusing at first but then it became boring and unapealling very quickly
i was really disapointed with this game it is all hand gestures for one which if you are a dancer makes no sense trying to translate foot placement to your hands
this would have been much better to have been designed as a ddrdance dance revolution style gamealso the graphics are terribleweve already traded it inwhen it comes to reality shows none has seen the heaviest light than dancing with the stars
the abc smash has really proven to light up the floors
but there is such a feeling of disbelief when a successful show has to become a video game
that high make it become an easy low after the dissapointing feel reality shows turned to video games like american idol and survivor
that is sad because the feeling of the game doesnt excite people to make their moves well
now that has shown as dancing with the stars makes it debut for the video game market and on the nintendo wii and to tell you the truth this isnt worth saving the last dance fordancing with the stars for the nintendo wii takes on the abc reality dance competeition into a spinning train wreck
the activision company which has delivered well with musical success with guitar hero fails to win over gamers
the gameplay works just like the show as you play with previous contestants like past winners emmit smith or fan favorites like saved by the bell actor mario lopez with the dancers like cheryl burke as you dance your way towards the judges hearts
the graphics fare well but the gameplay doesnt actually shine here unlike dance dance revolution which worked well with the dance pad here you dont actually have as much movement as you do with the wii remote unlike the playstation  edition which delivers better by actually making you dance to your hearts content
you can perform flair moves by simple use of the wii controller but it doesnt show that it shines well to gamers young and oldall in all dancing with the stars is a great reality show but it sadly misses the mark as really great music game
youre better off with guitar hero iii instead for the wii as a game that really rocks on
i also hope the next time a reality show makes it way into being a video game it doesnt feel like it is lesser of a game than the actual show like this one showsgraphics csound ccontrol cfun  enjoyment d for solo player c  for multiplayer actionoverall dat first let me say that if you are expecting this to be like just dance where you actually have to danceexercise then you will be disappointed
do not buy this game if that is what you expectthis game builds of course off the success of dancing with the stars celebrities are present in that you are judged by the actual show judges and get to witness an avatar pair dancing
gameplay is built around a series of wristflicks no more
arrows appear on the screen you flick your wrist with the direction of the arrows akin in a way to guitar hero games of a sort
at least thats what the gameplay reminded me ofhowever the gameplay patterns get repetitive really quickly and you arent normally looking just to flick your wrists back and forth when playing the wii
not only because it isnt fun but because wellit hurtsif youre looking for a fun dance game go with the just dance series
this game is only for the most hardcore of the fans of the show as it isnt really fun at allpros the gibs and copious amounts of blood are fun
yes thats right thats the end of the prosneutral reasonable soundtrack straight forward shooter aim shoot reloadcons no save anywhere checkpoints spread too wide bad ai
enemies either charge right at you often not firing right into the barrel of your gun or they charge out into the open and sit there waiting for you to kill them very few use duck  cover
dumb friendly ai a prisoner youre supposed to protect that runs out and sits there waiting to be shot ah yes middle eastern terrorists
that ole chestnut
i halfexpected nazis to show up
dumb story minor page tearing aka screen tearing aka vsync problem some occasional frame rate drops which even screwed up the sound one scenario in this game uses infinite enemies i hate that goofy cutscenes in which you have the bosses dead to rights at the end of your barrel multiple times but you dont shoot them for some reason again and again even though that is your solitary objective minor glitch with the soundtrack
at one point there were  overlapping soundtracks glitch with helicopter boss
you shoot it beat it scene ends but they were too cheap to show it blowing up or crash
 you are supposed to be able to modify your weapons
it has placeholders for this but i couldnt figure out how short
 hours or less easy
even on the most difficult setting you can still beat the game in  hours because the ai is so dumbi expected a lazy shooter with this title
thats what i got
but hitting the mark of lowered expectations doesnt mean you get high marks
of course you dontthis is no wiisport
not by a long shot
the darts game is annoying due to the limited range of motion used
if you throw the dart too fast it flies off screen
if you move your hand too far the dart flies off screen
whats the point of having a target if when you throw something at the target the game takes it off screen
there are aiming issues when playing this game on a bigscreen toothe air hockey game is horizontal and not vertical
yes they put the table on screen sideways  meaning instead of leftright motion used to defend the goal in most air hockey games this one requires an updown motion
the leftright motion in this game is a forwardbackward
its an utterly absurd design choice that ruins the gamethe rollerball game doesnt follow the usual control standards used in other games either
to adjust angle of roll instead of pressing a then leftright arrow you have to press the hoops game was mildly entertaining though again it suffers from a very limited range of movement
the action movement could be more realistic too
any wrist movement during the shot sends the ball off too high or too lowthe trivia game was mildly entertaining  though i somehow managed to spin the wheel seven different times and still managed to get the same category music
being asked a question about brittney spears ruined itthe pongcupwhatever toss game was hopelessdidnt try shuffleboardim trading this one asapplayed this one a few times and got bored with itreally a better game for kids
we are  and didnt really get into any of the games on this onebought this awhile ago and played it once
poor graphics and gameplay is just not good
dont waste your moneyi bought this thinking it was a party game not a party game
i thought the skill ball would be fun
its not
if your hand tilt right the ball goes left and viceversa
there is nothing to really keep you into this game except trying to find a better game to playand there just arent any
there really is nothing worth mentioning except save your money
the game play is weak the characters are mostly slight variations of a small number of different characters and it just isnt fun or captivating
i read that the quarters game was fun if you were drinking well perhaps but who wants to drink that much just to enjoy a video game
enough said
if you buy it i told you so is all i can saymany of these games on this disk cannot be played in two player mode
ring toss had to be the most frustrating game because it is almost impossible to get very many rings around the bottle
their version of skeet ball can be found on other games such as carnival
many of these games can be found elsewhere
honestly this was one of the most frustrating games it didnt inspire a lot of fun nor would i break it out at a partyanyone familiar with midways cruisn series in the arcades and the nintendo  will find that cruisn for the wii retains almost none of the fun gameplay elements that the previous games in the series possessed
cruisn bears little resemblance to the aforementioned games as it features some incredibly dated graphics a static interface and above all a barrage of technical issues
these technical issues range from long load times and a variety of bugs and glitches to be found among the boring and alltoo similar race tracks that are featured here
what is also worth noting is that the wiimote controls arent actually halfbad here and are pretty responsive overall but they cant save cruisn from the fate that its been given
all in all cruisn may be worth a look or a rental for wii owners looking for an arcade racer or fans of midways cruisn series but everyone else can easily avoid itthis game is not one of our favorites
the object of the game is simple  race aound the track against the clock and other cars
there are several views available while racing which is nice
you only have one choice of car to start with and have to earn the right to drive the legends
there are pit stops where you can add fuel or change tires if needed
these tasks take time but are easy to learntheres not much more to the game other then racing around the track
my children prefer mario brothers over this onei would recommend it to people who prefer a car racing game true to form and do not want all the bells and whistlesi just bought my first ps on dec  and i decided to start from the beginning so i bought not only  games but   and even  also
i love hack n slash games but i think i am late for this game probably i would love it if ive played it  years ago but on dec  this is just a mediocre hack n slash
there is a lot of blood and gore wich is great but the gameplay is not enoughyou can tell when a game has been rushed into production
how you ask
well it comes out like conan
after playing conan i have to wonder if the video game magazines out there are in bed with the game companies as well
how else can you explain gamepro giving this game a decent reviewokay so the animtions are nice but usually suffer from some serious frame drops when more than one character is on the screen
the graphics are simply unacceptable as a nextgen title
these are subpar prexbox at bestmy guess is that thq ran out of creative steam and instead of adding decent content and levels of play they simply chose to make each boss fight last forever
i mean seriously i enjoy a good boss fight but eight variations of the same boss fight before you finally defeat it
there is nothing fun about these boss fights periodthe controls are okay and as i previously stated the bodily hacking animations never get boring when they run smoothly that is
one question is why the annoying pause after executing a combo that has not hit an enemy
to annoy mei wanted to punch my tv several times playing this game and cancelled my subscription to gamepro magazine after buying it on their advice
i want unbiased reviews of a game period
if a games sucks say so before i spend sixty bucksin the sea of crap games out there conan sinks to the bottom danlucky for me i had a free rental credit at my local video place when i went to try this gameim all for button mashers
not a darn thing wrong with them
sure theres naked prisoner chicks that offer to repay you
conan gets it on with the hot amazonianesque protagonist
lop peoples arms and heads off grab them and slam then on the ground or into a pike barrier or off a cliff go into a cimmerian bezerker frenzythen completely screw it all up
annoying jump angles and camera views little scrawny guys with shields spiking the mighty conan and botching his swordwielding mojo boss battles that some idiot employee that has probably never played a video game in his life said heythis is a buttonmasher
oh noesone
let us put in a challengei know well make it so that you have to press a certain button when we tell you to
what the frick is that
do not interrupt the monotony of my buttonmashing naked chick rescuing headsevering melee frenzy
i want to grab little wimpy guys and slam them against the ground until i see brainsi do not want to watch conan fall off scaffolding over and over and over and over just because nobody bothered to play that part of the game and realize heythis actually sucks
forget god of war
god of wars specific button presses were integrated to a point that you felt you actually achieved something
it happened often enough that you were ready for it but not so often that you wanted to go s metal with your controllerconan lets you get relaxed and start to enjoy the mindless slaughter and then bombards you with that crap
the final boss battle
i have never never returned a video game earlyuntil i rented this one
its a trend that im starting to notice with newer video games unfortunately
you still have a gem every once in awhile but it seems that more and more companies are relying on the system way too much
heres an idea video game worker people forget about the system and make a good game
i dont care that the flowers are pretty if they smell like raw sewagethomas kinkaid could paint a little perfect pile of dog poo surrounded by cottageey snow covered perfection with a little poem running down the side of it written by john ashbery explaining how that in another reality the poo is our childhood imagination and then have a little digital box on the side of the picture that plays the voice of james earl jones reading the poem and in the end it would still be just a pile of crapin the endthats really what this game is
a pile of dog poo
you may get to walk through a pretty yard and play with a few decent toys but its not worth the cost of admission and the nasty smell that will follow you around for awhile
not to mention what it will do to your carpet when its stuck down in the treads of your shoeget it cheap if you insist on playingall the smackdown vs raw are the same thing i mean come on theirs nothing different about this game they just took out some characters and the story mode sucks really bad you cant really play just the computer  was the same but the best onei will start by saying this is going to be my most brief svr review of the serieswhy rate it  stars for fun and  overall
for me its as simple as saying this is svr with the annoucing glitches fixed and somewhat improved load times
had the game somehow managed to squeeze rvd and angle in for one last hoorah id probably say its a  for fun since their absence is a major downer although you can make some pretty decent caws for eachthe new wrestling categories like powerhouse and high flyer i could really do without
in fact i pretty much ignore their existance havent even attempted to use them since i dont really want anything resembling an arcade experience when i play a wrestling video game unless im playing hctpcertain things bother me that bothered me in svr such as chris masters not being introduced as the masterpiece
but if you win the match the announcer then remembers to announce you as the masterpiece chris masters
why not have the title during the entrance
makes no sense to methe reduced number of grapples is basically the same as  with  grapples entirely dedicated to ucms which takes some fun out things unless you actually like those
editi forgot that in svr you had  categories of grapples  a ucm per category but only  categories were wrestler specific
sorry for that oversight
end editthe game looks great and plays equally well
the hit detection is spot on and its nice to actually see the damage you do to your opponent really seem to effect them as the match grinds on
ever notice in some of these titles that even though the guys are limping around from their beatings that theyll find some way to sprint across the ring to save their tag partner out of nowhere
that doesnt happen here if you beat the opponents tag partner to the point theyre glowing red all over they are doing nothing but hobbling around the ring regardless of the situation
i actually didnt get this sense as much in  but i could be misremembering
i should play that one again to confirmrandom side note the finisher special effect is by far the most dissapointing in the series
its just a quick  angle view of the move with some weak sound effect and kind of time warplike effect
i would like to think given a bit of thought they could have come up with something better especially considering how much i enjoy the finisher effects in  and as always its a must own for any svr fan even if this is widely considered the worst title in the series
by all means it probably is the worst when compared to the others but its still worth owning just for the year to year changes in rostersattires
especially now when you can find every installment so cheap  dollars or less typicallycrappy roster slow loading times dumb angles in the story mode terrible move controls its almost impossible to do a reversal cause the opportunity flashes for half a second and in video game time it just doesnt work it takes a tremendous effort to take the belt off the hook in the ladder match which makes it very frustrating its hard to make tags commentary gets old quicklyi could go onthey should make a game where the wwe world is free roaming and you choose your allies enemies your angles etcand then the computer puts their input based on your choicesi hate being forced to fight people when i dont want to and i hated that rowdy piper came back and turned on me as a tag team partner  what purpose does that hold in   if i am triple h why is piper beating my a and making me look like a loser
maybe kamala can come back too and feud with triple h in the next version that would be just as smartok first off ive been playing tabletop whk since nd editionback when squats were an army
if you know what that means you know that is a really long time
so i was stoked when dawn of war came out and man it didnt disappoint
so here i am stuck in iraq and i heard this game was coming outsweet right
so i order it greedily unwrap it play itand i felt excited at first
sure its awesome to blow away a heretic with a shotgun but slowly but surely flaws ariseas in you move forward a bit at a time covering other units but your teammates seem to consistantly shoot each other if they happen to be in each others sectors of fire
also and this is why it gets a low rating is its so damned unrealistic
with the ap system an enemy will run at you shoot you point blank then run behind a wall
excuse me
ok i got it its turn based but what the hell
it becomes a crude game akin to running up to someone kicking them in the groin then running and hiding
when the guy finds where you hid he kicks you back then runs etc etc etc
so if youre a big whk fan avoid this game
it only got a nd star because i love k so much
if you need to waste time here and there between activities in life in my case patrols try sudoku
seriously
dont buy this
you know bill from king of the hill
this game is the bill of warhammer games
a good guy but damn what a loserthe bad they took a lot of matches and modes out
you can basically only wrestle single tag triple threat and a couple others
the season mode has essentially no storylines
you just challenge guys to matches or they challenge you until you get the legend rank
matches are very shortthe good graphics and weapons are cool
its fun using the wii remote to do the moves even if they dont vary a lot from wrestler to wrestler
the roster is pretty complete
commentary from jr king joey styles etc but it does get repetitiveoverall fun to play but i really wish there didnt remove match types and storylines in the season modeit works but the quality is terrible
do not buy this for an hd tv
the only reason to buy this particular cable is if you play your ps or ps on a old tube tv
there you wont be able to tell the differencewhen i read  ps ps pc compatible i understand it literally
that means no exceptions or limitations
dont be naive like me
cause it is not fully compatible
i needed an extra gamepad for ps and ps for my friends when they come over
i couldnt test it on all my games i have which is a good thing cause it saved me a lot of time to realize that is just another gimmick for game players sony platforms fans
hookups are quite easy
plug n play type of thing
try   ps atv  nothing i mean it wasnt even detected
try   ps atv it was detected though but  theres nothing you can do with it to program this gamepad etc
 try   ps motorstorm it just overlaps the original sixaxisdualshock controller leaving you no options for multiplayer games
wanted to give it a shot  ps pure but i kinda lost my nerve there
with all honesty it works as good as genuine sony gamepad what comes with ps in a single mode great grip too
 except one thing  why the hell is it so damn small about  off than original size
if youve played a lot of games with a sixaxisdualshock controller youre getting used to its buttons and size how it feels in your hands
why make it smaller why
since it was designed for sony playstation to begin with
its like giving lumberjack a butchers knife instead of an axe
sorry for that metaphor
so to sum up im gonna return this product maybe and for yall guys out there please find out if thrustmaster gamepad is right for you and your gaming needs before you buy itbelieve it or not ive owned two thrustmasters one for the wii and this one here for the psps
they are virtually identical
they are very tight
words can not describe how small this thing is its the exact same size as the wii thrustmaster so you have a really small controller with really cramped buttons
often while using the dpad ill hit the left analog stick
the dpad itself is probably the worst part of the game pad
very picky i remember the wii thrustmaster had a wonky dpad too
the analog sticks work great the face buttons are soso
they arent as responsive as a real psps controller
usually requires more pressure when pressing them to register
again very comparable to the wii thrustmaster
the triggersbumpers are mostly decent
you get turbo and customizable button configurations with this controller
its neat that the thing works with a pcps and ps
i think the best people for this controller left handed people and people who like to customize their buttons
maybe small kids who arent going to be annoyed by the actual performance of the controller
its light as a feather
but for me too small too light too cramped but above all not the best quality buttons and thats what matters the most
its not very playableas someone that spent way too much time playing the puzzle quest demo for the pc i was really looking forward to finally playing this game
i picked it up for the wii so that my fiancee who loves bejeweled could play it with mehowever while it is exactly the same star game under the hood its appearance and interface on the wii make it a star version
the first time i fired it up my fiancee said ew
the graphics dont translate to the tv at all  i tried it both on my big screen and on a  standard def screen and the text is nearly impossible to read and the graphics get mangled by the translation
it just looks uglyfurthermore this was the first game on the wii where they didnt use the wii interface correctly  instead of using the point at the letters keyboard interface that every other wii game uses this makes you hit up and down on the dpad to slowly scroll through every letter in order to enter your name
furthermore the pointer used to move jewels on the board is very shaky meaning that it will falsely make moves for you costing you your turn as well as some life
you can get around it by switching to the nunchuck controls which also doesnt make a lot of sense since the nunchuck isnt used for anything but the c and z buttons  which could have easily been put on the  and  avoiding the need to twohand the controls for the game at all which just feels very awkwardit also doesnt support play over the internet which is pretty disappointingwhile puzzle quest is an awesome game i would recommend that everyone avoid this port of it like the plague and pick up the pc version instead
the appearance and interface issues with this version just suck all the fun out of itthis game was a huge disappointment
after reading the description i decided to take the plunge and buy it no free trial with this one because i was ready for something other than another hidden objects game
the storyline sounded intriguing the screen shots looked good so i figured this would be a lot of fun
but not sofirst of it made me seriously motionsick
this is a firstperson game and whenever the cursor moves just a tiny bit the room viewperspective changes
several times i just had to take a break because all that movement made me nauseous
i also got tired very quickly of having to constantly adjust the view  the game is way too sensitive to cursor movement and so i ended up accidentally staring at ceilingsfloors way more often than i would have likedsecondly there really was not too much to do in the first place
i spent almost all my time wandering aimlessly through one drablooking scene after another without being able to figure out what i had to do
so i finally just gave up and never finished it
it was just too boring and depressing
my husband who is a very different game player and actually enjoys solving difficult puzzles etc
ie
not at all an impatient hint hunter like me  also quietly quit playing it
he agreed that it was boring and that it required too many steps to get something done plus one never knew what one was supposed to dohad it just been me i would have chalked it up to this game simply being not my type of game but this assessment coming from my husband as well convinces me that this is just not a good and interesting game
my admittedly subjective advice save yourself the moneythis game tries hard and runs well but for one whose very favorite is morrowind it doesnt cut it
of course millions were probably not spent in development and marketing and no one should expect it to be another morrowind
to me it is boring and i cant seem to make myself play it enough to get out of the academybeing a huge star wars fan as a kid and moderately as an adult i bought this game thinking it was gonna be at least decent
this game doesnt deliver enough to keep you wanting to play more
it can be frustrating and very boring at the same timei wasnt really impressed here
the gameplay is repetitive and monotonous
story lines dont keep things moving forward and dont contribute to the star wars universe in any way worthwhilei have played many star wars games i guess i buy alot of star wars related productsi own galatic battlegrounds many of the sw shooters rpgs and the entire line of rogue squadron type games
empire at war is better than galatic battlegrounds but lucas still comes up short the gameplay isnt excellent i still prefer command and conquer the characters that make up the star wars galaxy seem to be there just as an afterthoughti bought it beat it and tried to resell this product to a used store but they wouldnt take itvery cute looking game
the isntructions booklet is quite vague on what you have to do exactly or how to use the stylus as the other controls on your ds are hardly used at alla character thats a talking stork will giude you every now and then
and it gets repetitive to do over and over and over the same tasks again and again and again
ughhthe graphics music and realistic movements of the babies are very well done all very colorful and eye catching great music too
though the sounds and graphics are wonderful the game gets repetitive too quickly and you have a hard time using the stylus to perform every single task in the game which often evades you to the extreme in many chores
i had to push hard the stylus against the screen to get things done most annoying to say the least
fearing that too much pressure would harm my ds unit but it seems no other way to ityou never change diapers lack of realism and the game itself is a large sequence of mini games
youll unlock cool clothes costumes shoes and other goodies for the babies home furtinure and paint for your home
i hope ubisoft makes a sequel with a more rpg style and mush easy control of the tasks with less repetition
i only give it  stars
nice presentationcute babies
but slightlyboring gameplaydue to repetition
if ubisoft does a sequence they should spice it up a little and work out some of the mentioned imperfectionsthis game dont have the quality expected from games of ps the graphics looks that were made in only two days and are not the same that you see on the introduction movie of this gamei think for the ps need a better  maker of games the console can do more than thatbut i only paid  for iti guess if you have a young child that wants to learn a language this is an alright resource
it is mostly disjointed memorization that rarely builds on itself
i didnt expect this to be magical or better than rosetta stone or pimsleur but it really isnt worth it beyond the initial use
maybe a small child would get more out of it just to introduce them to the concept of language studiesi am a native english speaker who learned french last year
this got me very excited about languages and i decided i really wanted to learn spanish
i thought this spanish coach would be a great place to start
and i have to say for the first  lessons it is a fun and effective way to get into the language
however after the first  lessons they take maybe  hours to complete and to really feel like youve learned everything in them the game goes into what it calls the open lessons
this is how it worksstarting with lesson  you get  words per lesson to master
you get no phrases no conjugations no grammar
the words are seemingly chosen at random though they are set in the game in that order so you cant change it
i went through about  of these open lessons there are i think  in the end
 and found them to be utterly ridiculous
instead of learning useful vocabulary like bird you learn the word for oriole
instead of to say you learn to utter
things like that
essentially you learn words that are not used in every day language
i kept doing the next lesson certain that things would level out but each lesson i was presented with words that i cant even imagine using even in english
ive read similar reviews to mine and they were righti rarely leave online reviews for products but i felt that i needed to say something about this game
it really isnt worth the money in the end and it is a shame because if they put more time into this game they could be much better
i think the whole series follows this same formula
they really need to rework these games and rerelease them
i sincerely hope they domy daughter  was really happy to get this game at first but tired of it quickly
the hamsters are moody and dont do as much as the product info says
graphics are pretty good
she likes hamsterz life betterdo not get this confused with hampsterz 
i made this mistake and found out the hard way
my  year old daughter originally played hampsterz because a friend owned it
so i went to the store and got it
well i got hampsterz  the guy at the store said its the same thing just more features
wrong
its is completely a different game
and hard too
my  year old even cant stand it
there is very little hampster play
you spend most of the game talking to the computer in imaginary friend sequences in the bedroom
after reading information online i discovered my mistake and have since returned the game for the real hampsterz game
hampsterz  was a shady attempt to sneak in a different game under the popular hampsterz title
its a shame
im glad my video game store allowed me to return it with no hassles
otherwise it would have been going in the trash
if you look on ebay there are tons of these for sale cheap and only one hampsterz game for twice as much as it retails
that alone shoudl tell you something
dont waste your money on hampsters pros not a bad idea for action gamecons tons of controls buttons buttons buttons and buttons  very hard to move around fast and feel fluent with all these buttons  batman ark

is so much easier faster and cooler at this point especially if playing splinter cell first time for get about itthere is no way to remain stealth but thats the only way to have a crowd controlthe first thing i hated  hated that you have to perform a hand to hand combat kill first in order to do a selected multikill  that limitation is so stupid  the guy is a pro for gods sakeanother dumb part is that the guy has to buy things when he can simply take them  why
because everybody around him is already deadthe graphics once again compare to batman aa this game has so poorgloomy graphics im running it on high and besides that i didnt see x resolution in the settings
batman looks much more excitingstoryline well i dont know what to say  i guess they just picked one of those good old commando ideas so not inspiring
eg
hitman games got a cool storyline
ac  got great storyline
ac ii got okay storyline batman blah blah blahi played this game for one hour and went totally cold to it
however if youre completely bored and have absolutely nothing else to do well its not one of those old fashion first person shooter games where you have a vertigo after  min or so i dont own this game but spent some good time on it at a friends houseanyways its not bad
pretty fun but this is not a splinter cell game
im a hardcore sc fan from the first title
sc pandora tomorrow is one of my alltime favorite gamesubisoft shame
if you take sc out of this title this would be a great title
just call this game conviction and you have a fun game with some faint sc ideashe doesnt even look like sam fisher
what the  
is this a joke ubisoft
he has the same voice actor which is surprising
michael ironside is a great actor
i think if he thoroughly reviewed this game hed say no
what the hell is this ubisoft
hed say
make a real sc game and ill give you my voice for the real sam fisher
end of storyi loved the splinter cell seriesuntil now
ubisoft has been one of the better developers in my opinion but recently they have been going in a direction that i dont like
instead of making games that are challenging creative and funthey are predictable boring and without any imaginationso what did i like about this game
well first of all i only made it through the first  hours of this game before i couldnt take any more so i can only speak for the portion of it that i actually played
the story starts off slow but the intro was interesting
i did like the way sam is given the next target by displaying it in the scene itself
it makes the gameplay smoother
i also like the mark and execute
there was more shooter than stealth in the sections that i played but i didnt get through enough of the game to decide if that was a plus or a minus
beyond that there wasnt much to like
as far as the graphics go they are decent but nothing specialthe dialogue is offensive and lacking any imagination whatsoever
just imagine a lot of fface fyou m f and you pretty much know the entire dialogue of every npc
not much better was sams banal dialogue with grim in what should have been an emotional scene
i also did not like fisher becoming basically a thug
sure he feels the need for revenge but couldnt they have thought up something a bit less predictable than just smashing everybodys face in
perhaps they did and it came later in the game if so it came too late for me
as for the multiplayer i didnt play that so i cant give an opinion on iti see a trend in games that i personally dont care for
they are being dumbed down with overthetop offensive language more violence and gore nudity sex and a combination of all of these and being labeled m for mature
what is the point
i see this as more juvenile than adult
max payne was mature and had mature themes but it didnt use cheap tactics to achieve that
this trend is not just growing in the gaming world but in movies and on tv
seriously i am getting a severe case of violence fatigue
i cant stand anymore
fortunately i dont watch tv but giving up gaming is hard
sadly there are fewer games now where the developers actually spend the time and energy to make a creative game worth playing
there are some exceptions like the makers of games like portal or lucas artsnote to ubisoft yes i am in the minority
but i am one of those fortunate adults who have the financial resources to buy all the games i want and a buttkicking gaming rig or an xbox to play them on
and i actually pay for all my games unlike those little teens that this kind of game appeals to who are busy downloading their pirated copies so they can play it
i have nothing against teens by the way i use to be one
i just want some decent games to play where i dont have to make sure my windows are closed in case my neighbors little girls are out playing on their drivewaylike they were when i started playing this game
i forgot my windows were open at first and only later freaked out when i remembered and ran to shut themin conclusion if you want an intelligent interesting story to go with some challenging actionlook elsewhere or rent it first to see if you are going to like it
if story is not important and you like oodles of mindless facesmashing violence relentless profanity repeated shooting of everyone in every segment of the gamethen this is for you
go for itthe splinter cell games have alway been the suit the weapongs the spi stuff
now sam is old no gadgets or at least not the gagets we as fans are use too
and also now we cant do some of the things that we could do in all the other games like move bodies
we get two new moves that i like but the sub them two moves and took away all the other moves we use to do
i dont know if the guy or people  that developed this game are the same people that made the other but u guys if you read this review really messed up a great gameand if you are reading this review and its your first time playing the series this game is the worst one in that series
play the other if you have the system to play them on
if you have played the others and want to know if you should buy this game or not just know that its still a good game just not a great one and nothing like the other splinter cell games
just think of it as you playing sam fisher as a civillian and youll get the ideathe gameplay is ok even though the ai gets stupid at times
the graphics voice acting character models are just terrible which really ruins the game in my opinion
ubisoft should close their doors if they put out any more games like this onesplinter cell has been my favorite game series since it first arrived on the scene
the stealth action and gadgets not to mention its emphasis on  avoidance and evasion game play made it unique
sadly all that made splinter cell stand out is gone and its been turned into a hybrid rip off of gears of wars and call of duty
killing is the emphasis in the single player campaign so much so that the developers have even automated the process with the new mark and execute feature that allows you to select up to  bad guys and press one button then sit back and watch sam kill in a slow motion bullet time splatterfest
forget about catching and disabling an enemy now sam just goes for blood
you can sneak up on a guard but your options now are kill him or capture him then kill him or use him as a human shield then kill him
sam cant use a whistle or pickup and throw objects to distract or lure guards as in the past
no longer do you hide bodies either
just as with all the other shooters just stroll into a room go on a killing rampage and exit the other side rinse and repeat
gone is any thought required to evade andor capture
no need to hack or pick locks anymore either that too would take to much time away from the killing
sams rapages are aided by a new duck and cover style system that makes the game feel like a gears of war ripoff rather then a splinter cell game
the levels are now much more arcade like and closed off similar to the call of duty series
this detracts from the open world feel of the previous games in the serieson the plus side gone are the simplistic busy work mini games that the developers either thought were really cool or tried to use as filler for the previous splinter cell double agentthe language in this game is appaling ive heard less fbombs at eddie murphy concerts
theres little to no point of every other word being some variation of the fbomb
was this written by  year olds that get a laugh everytime they hear the f wordfor real fans of sam fisher splinter cell conviction will likely disappoint
its dumbed down and is no longer a stealth action game but has become a third person shooter
for those that dont have the attention span andor patients to play a thinking persons game and want dumbed down run and gun rampages this is your gameok before the biased fans rip my head off cause they dont want to admit that they wasted  the day it came out on a mediocre game  that should have been at least  game
let me just break down what is so bad about this gamestory lets just say the story is not original here if youve seen the cult classic equilibrium then this is a poor mans version of that movie
the ultimate enforcer who is somewhat controlled in some ways by using a drug protects a corrupt government who when they by luck goes into detox and start seeing how corrupt the government is and joins the very rebellion he was trying to destroy and help them crush the government
as good as the story may sound they find a way to screw it up by putting one dimensional characters bad voice acting and a very predictable ending
and sad to say this was ridiculously short at least  hours long  for those who suck at gamesgraphics its not the worst thing ive seen but its obvious to gamers whove played alot of games that this is some pretty outdated graphics in this game
felt like i was playing a pc game from  felt like a bad version of halo and crysisrequirements this is where it really pisses me off
why on earth does this game need gb of space requirement
it has a very very short plot the graphics are outdated the loading time is a little long and yet it needs gb
please
modern warfare  and bad company  have short campaign stories and great graphics and yet still only manage to take mb or mb of spaceso sadly this game had the right idea but it was halfbaked and and it felt that the creators got lazy on what could have been a very good franchiseafter all the delays and the hype i must say haze is a bit of a disappointment
this game feels incomplete and buggy almost like it was still in beta stages
i found that it takes a few minutes for a cut scenes to take place and by that time your so confused as of whats going on that youve lost all interest
the ai is dumb and incoherent they get in your way and dont provide any support when attacking enemies
the dialogue and story arent something to brag about either
the dialogue sounds like it was written by a drunk frat boy and youll find some notorious lines will be repeated at least a hundred times throughout the game which gets annoying yeaaa booyyyy
gun varieties are lacking and graphics are mid ps and ps generation
this game has not broken any new grounds for fpss and fails to impressthe firstperson shooter  and especially the futuristic firstperson shooter  has been done over and over with little to no changes in gameplay since almost the beginning of gaming itself
with that said games like haze occasionally try to mix things up a little and while the idea is good the execution ends up dragging it down a lotthe underlying plot of the game both singleplayer and multiplayer is that in the future a companyorganization called mantel uses a drug called nectar to produce a generation of druggedup super soldiers to fight for them in the third world
multiplayer battles consist of skirmishes between mantel troopers and rebels while in singleplayer you start as a trooper and switch sides later onthe two sides have the same basic firstperson gameplay with some key abilities that are different
mantel troopers inject themselves with nectar which enhances their perception scopes can zoom in farther enemies are rendered as glowing objects and strength soldiers move faster hit harder and regenerate health as well as providing a hallucinogenic high
there is a limited supply of nectar that each soldier has but it regenerates over time the supply is counted in shots or injections
holding the l button down injects nectar into your bloodstream represented by a gauge
release the button too soon and you wont feel the effects of it for long
if you hold it down for too long though you can overdose which renders you unable to tell between friend and foe
in many cases when you are overdosed you are unable to control yourself even to the point of randomly firing weapons or arming grenades which you must shake the controller to throw away before it detonates
if you run out of nectar you are highly vulnerable for this reason you can usually siphon nectar off of one of your teammates if they have enoughon the other side the rebels are as weak in combat as a mantel trooper without his nectar
they make up for this with various ingenious techniques
some rebel weapons are coated with nectar specifically knives and grenades that are made from nectarpacks taken from dead troopers
both of these weapons can cause nectar overloads in enemies causing the aforementioned selfdamaging effects
playing off of nectars effect of making dead bodies invisible bodies fade almost instantly when playing as a trooper but remain for a long time when playing as a rebel rebel soldiers can play dead when hit and then revive after the troopers have left
rebels can also do various mechanical improvisations such as taking ammo from dropped weapons and converting it to ammo for the weapon they are currently using as well as turning grenades into proximity mines
finally theyre generally faster and more agile than their trooper counterparts capable of dodging and in some cases stealing an enemys weaponthe singleplayer storyline is laughable for the most part with some interesting parts
you play as shane carpenter wideeyed idealist youth who joins mantel to make a difference and stop the unspecified mass murders and ethnic cleansings that the rebels are carrying out
the story starts on a carrier where carpenter meets his teammates  gungho drugfueled murderers in the finest traditions of scifi and war movies everywhere
only the difference here is that it makes sense  its plain to see that nectar screws with your mind just by the effects that show up when you use it ingame the blurring the sudden shifts of motion and so on
carpenters injection system malfunctions several times which a leaves the player unable to use nectars beneficial effects and b causes carpenter to see things that his fellow troopers dont see a dying comrade screams of pain massive piles of bodies and so on
carpenter questions his mission more and more eventually leading to his switch to the rebel side midway through the game
most of the story is hamhanded dialogue though there are some good atmospheric moments walking through one burntdown village or trying to find your way through a swamp for example
these moments tend to only use dialogue as background noise  the heavyhanded boasting of the mantel troopers contrasts against the quiet of the jungles ambient noises
the use of camera in cutscenes is interesting but not really new the view is always from carpenters firstperson perspective though in some scenes his visor will slide away so that the hud doesnt block your view
in most cutscenes you can look around but not move lending at least some feeling of interactivity to the scenesas a whole the gameplay  as mentioned  tries some interesting things but ultimately falls short
a lot of it makes sense as a mantel trooper  the poor control for example or the lack of solid feeling to movement and aiming  but when youre a rebel and youre supposed to be free of the hallucinatory drug its just bad
the guns are the most generic firstperson guns ever  a pistol an assault rifle a shotgun a sniper rifle a chaingun a flamethrower and a rocket launcher
none of them handle well and none of them are particularly fun or interesting either
grenades are pretty much worthless and even in single player ive never managed to kill a person with one even when it exploded right underneath him
the vehicles handle incredibly poorly often flipping with little to no provocation
on that note your ai buddies  all have roughly the same abilities as yourself but if they die they are gone forever and finding new allies is incredibly rare
with that said most of the times i had allies die counting times i reloaded afterwards was in vehicle crashes when id take too much of an angle my buggy would flip and my gunner would die
other than that the ai soldiers are reasonably helpful though the troopers and their nectar injections are much tougher and more helpful than the rebel allies who lack both the strength of the troopers and the ingenuity of the player and are left with pretty much nothingthe graphics are nice in some ways and terrible in others
for example they load slowly leading to that awkward phase where you watch a persons resolution increase in front of you
in other places animation is jerky or edges are jagged or some other flaw exists that prevents the onthesurface good graphics from actually being good
furthermore the designs are both silly and generic especially the mantel vehicles and their bright yellow glass
the voice acting is generic too not bad but by no means actually good and the ridiculousness of the lines makes up for whatever points good voice acting might have gainedthis game has some good ideas but the underlying genre of futuristic firstperson shooter and the incredibly poor execution of graphics and gameplay render this game unbearable
for ps shooters resistance was better for shooters in general pretty much anything is better
this game doesnt deserve anything higher than a haze has had a good bit of hype surrounding it especially considering its a ps exclusive fps that seemed to be loaded with potential
playing as a futuristic soldier with the ability to supe themselves up to almost superhuman capability thanks to a drug called nectar
while this little feature does manage to add a bit of spice to the overall gameplay aspects of haze as a whole the game doesnt offer up anything that hasnt been seen a million times before in a million other first person shooters or for that matter do much of anything particularly well either
there are some moments of spectacular action that show off the kind of potential that haze had to be a great game but these moments are few and far between
where haze really falters is with the games presentation the storyline dialogue and voice acting are all deliriously bad and the games ai doesnt fare much better either
fourplayer coop and multiplayer are bland but decent enough and the game looks good and offers a decent selection of weapons
however the overall core of haze is disappointingly shallow despite the games interesting premise and ps owning fps fans are better off giving this a rental and holding out for resistance i honestly havent played this game but i watched some game play on youtube and this does not look like a wellthought out video game
the graphics looks subpar the voice actors were inappropriate for the characters and setting
i watched all of  minute and  seconds of this game before i knew that i didnt want it
if youre interested here is the video i watched on youtube  and no im not associated with the person who posted this video in any way shape or formive seen some of the reviews on here why anyone would rate this game  stars troubles me
you must be out of your mind but to each their own
i rented this game from gamefly a while back and if anyone knows their policy its keep it as long as you like
unfortunately that motto was quicker than expected
it was sent back after i played it
the game is horrifichaze seemed like an interesting enough storyline but boy was i way off
the story was boring and stupid
the gameplay was sloopy and weak
the controls were horrible and the enemies were almost impossible to see at certain times especially in the jungles
the graphics were the only thing that saved this rating from a  star
the graphics were pretty decent surprisingly but no where near what the ps is capable ofubisoft what were you thinking
next time do not rush your games out just to make a quick buck
save the time and make a good game
i was very disappointed with haze
i love the rainbow six games this was no where near as good in fact it just plain sucks
dont waste your time
i wouldnt even buy it if amazon dropped the price to a  or maybe i would just to have a coaster for my drinksto start with something nice the game is fun
unfortunately there are more negative aspects to the game that really bring it downfirst and foremost the graphics are terrible
not just that but they are inconsistant
some textures will be pretty nice and others look like the developers just didnt care
the particle effects primarily in the smoke and fire are the worst i have seen in years
they are almost embarrassingthe game isnt organized well it seems to just shuffle you around from place to place without much of a purpose
most of the time i spent either lost not knowing which path to take while hitting select regularly to remind myself of what i was doingthe ai is awful
you can stand right next to enemies and they wont even see youtoo easy
the mantel soldiers are too easy to kill and at certain parts where you are told to hold off the mantel onslaught turns into no more than shooting a couple guys
some onslaughtthe weapons lack substance
i found myself using the mantel and promise hand assault rifles most of the time
certain areas are easier by using the rocket launcher but there never seems to be any reasoning with the placement or specific use of other weaponslast is the glitches
i have had lockups after check points and fellow promise hand soldiers firing at invisible enemy mantel soldiers hitting me and everyone else in the processthey always say dont judge a book by its cover and this is one of those cases
the cover looks sweet
the game inside unfortunately is notfor a ps exclusive title this game just does not deliver
ubisoft and free radical should be embarrassedfirst i am not holding it against the game that it took me  minutes of downloading data and updates just to play this mediocre game
the cutscenes and dialog are truly painful and wout a way to skip past them you must suffer or go make a sandwich
the controls are generally fine but it feels like you are going thru the motions and just killing time i didnt find anything technically wrong here but it just seemed to have whatever it is that makes a game an invigorating experience and most of all fun
i would say personally this is one of ubisofts worst games
not a bad rent if you want to check it out though
i guess the biggest thing to me is that this game had some real potential esp
they had put the time into it like the rainbow six games
but as it stands i would rather play black againsigh i have a huge game collection
it takes up  shelves in my house and my wife keeps the dvds downstairs
haze is  of the only two games ive ever traded in
ill play any game and keep it but haze is used kitty litter

this game isnt as memorable as dragon warrior monsters  or  they made this game too forced in terms of gameplay and level grinding dwm  and  were much more accessible and playerfriendly plus its gameplay was much longer than this gamethis is truly a disappointment to the older games even with its prosi was excited about this game and loved the idea of another monsterbreeding rpg
sadly this game just didnt cut it for me
i didnt even make it through the first monster tournament task before i gave it up
life is short and there are better games id rather spend my limited free time onwhy i dislike itstorythe story is incredibly forced and unnecessarily angst filled
its a ds game obviously geared toward young boys so i did not expect the story to be fantastic but i found it to be unbearably bad
i had several lol moments at just how terrible the story was and i already mentioned that i didnt make it too fargame playmuch more important than the story is the game play
overall it just wasnt fun for me
on your very first island as you are starting to build a suite of low level monsters bam you get hit by a high level giant who kills you in one hit
great now all the work i did to get to the top of the hill is gone because there are limited save points here
i pushed on past the first island hoping things would improve but it just wasnt happening
the next island despite the fact that i spent a good hour grinding the first still had monsters that killed me easily
the limited space to carry monsters and backup monsters was very irritating
i had one monster type that could heal but it was nearly impossible to level it up since island  monsters minus the giant were so low level that i didnt get enough experience to level in  hr and island  monsters creamed my poor healer
its only possible to save at save points that tend to be located at the beginning of the island near the low level easy monsters so if you get injured while exploring you have to hightail it back to the entrance while avoiding monsters if you want to save your progresssummarypoor story and frustrating game play lead to me trading this game in for pokemon white  never looked back
if you dont want to spend hours grinding low level unrewarding monsters just to make it to the next story arc this game isnt for you
simultaneously if you are one of those parents who limit their childs time playing video games to hr or less dont buy this game
there are other rpgmonster games even others in the dragon quest series which are much more rewarding and enjoyablefor those who never played the psone original ff tactics is a solid turnbased rpg with outstanding length and customization features
the storyline a complete snore in the early hours ramps up into an unexpected gemhowever two major complaints with the game and the reason for the twostar review the genre has passed this game by
disgaea also a remake but of a ps game on the psp has a more diverse battle system and jeanne darc is such a polished product in terms of storytelling and gameplay compared to this one
the graphics
read every other review here even the good ones and youll notice the same complaint about the graphical translation  theyre fuzzy
too fuzzy for my eyes
i felt almost sickened after the playing the game for extended periods and could not finish playing the game as i did with the psone version
this combined with the restrictive camera angles makes playing the game a chore for the retinasbe forewarned
theres a good game hidden underneath the visual mess but its quite a messif youre looking for a fresh take on the turnbased strategy genre though turn back now
a long time has passed since this austere game first appeared and while it was something of a creative anomaly at that time now its age is showing and unfortunately it has not aged wellafter three weeks of deep immersion in ff xii the ps game my expectations were probably too high for revenant wings
i suspended disbelief willingly at first then with some effort and finally not at all  rw gets worse over time
like ff tactics this is a battle rattle for rts boys with a glut of sophomoric japanese idealistic fantasizing about teamwork plus a few cloyingly sweet short movies for ffs other demographic infantile girls
but seriously folks i have a real beef with the creators of this game  the gratuitous gory details about viera outcasts were peurile and underdramatized to quote wednesday adams
with all the possibilities in that backstory to just chop it off undeveloped was sad and very rude
it would have been better not to mention it at allthe complete change of battle system is jarring to fans of the original xii
this game is far slower paced than its predecessorthis is a tactics  real time battle based ff rpg for the ds
i much preferred the fantastic remake of ff iv and ff iii as well as the newer four heroes of light
i found the learning curve to be too difficult on this title and couldnt get into it
admittingly i have an aversion to real time battle rpg and prefer turn based strategy so my bias is part of the reason i was disappointed
if you like real time battle and have patience you may have a lot more fun than i did but to classic rpgers go for the ff iii and especially iv as well as heroes of light before thiswhile overall this game is not bad it is frustrating when the difficulty level suddenly increases to the point that you find yourself unable to progress
i finally made it to the chaos battle and could not beat the duel bosses
i tried literally over a hundred times after leaving to level up to the point that i was repeating monster melees to gain levels
this is ultimately stupid and a waste of my time
on top of that the gameplay eventually does become monotonous try failing at the same battle that many times and see what i mean and the story that is told ultimately seems thrown together haphazardly
overall a game to avoid as its downfalls outweigh its plusessimply put the first supernova is way better
this one just doesnt have a wide variety of music
there are some awesome classics but they come inbetween few and many
the music should be better
otherwise itsok my yearold found this game so frustrating and difficult to understand they were in tears after an hour of trying to play it
it doesnt appear to save data so you have to go through the entire initial story each timethe story line is violent which is not what this game tries to sell itself as
i think it was someones attempt to simulate webkinz but id didnt work
at allif your kids are too young to read yet this game will be totally useless for them as there is a lot of text to readyou dont really get to choose what you want to do there is no just wandering around getting to know the game
it always forces you to play the next course
there is danger of your puppy dying from attacks
my animalloving kids ended up hating itit appears that the publisher made a moneysavingmaking choice to put this project into production for multiple languages and decided to hire an english text writer and tranlator instead of good voiceover talentwhat could have been a fun game for kids ends up being a poorly produced string of really bad textwelcome back to the days of silent movies folks
you have to read everything while watching characters sway their heads back and forthboringif you have a kindergartener who wants to play this game expect to have to sit there and read the dialogue for every scene to himhersave your money visit the library and take out a few good bookssure youll still be reading and spending time with your kids but itll be worth itthis one is a coasterbased on the anime and manga series by tite kubo bleach shattered blade has all the parts in place for a good fighting game
however the game defies all expectations in how poorly it is executedthe only thing relevant to the game that you need to know about bleach is that there are ghost samurai called soul reapers who have unique swords with different powers
sounds like a great basis for a fighting game right
well shattered blade seems to somehow mess up the simple fighting game formula with a poor concept and poorer handling
the game is a d fighting game  the two fighters can circle around each other to dodge attacks
attacks are divided into three varieties  slash horizontal slash chop vertical slash and stab forward attack
these are done by moving the wii remote in the appropriate manner to imitate such an attack
the attack types work on a rockpaperscissors hierarchy chop beats slash slash beats stab and stab beats chop
so basically if you interrupt a chop attack with a stab attack the stab attack will go through
theres also a little minigame that can occur if two swords clash where both fighters go through five rounds of rock paper scissors with each other
the more rounds you win the more damage youll do once its overthere are three kinds of attacks
regular attacks are done by simply waving the wii remote with no buttons pressed  these are very fast but do little damage and their purpose is to weather down an enemy for a critical attack
critical attacks are stronger slower melee attacks that are done by combining a wii remote movement with holding down the a button
critical attacks change depending on the character but are not particularly personalized
special attacks are the final type of attack and are done by holding b while moving the wii remote
these tend to be more personalized based on the character  projectile attacks and special abilities fall within this categoryeach character also has a poweredup mode achieved by charging shaking the wii nunchuck or by taking damage both of which fill a gauge
once the gauge is full the character enters their higherlevel state
this involves a cutscene that lasts about  to  seconds and cannot be skipped in a second battle this is kind of an annoyance
some characters simply get stronger with their poweredup state while others change more drastically in their attack patterns
for example kenpachi zaraki simply strengthens his attacks while toshiro hitsugaya summons a giant ice creature to augment his techniques and renji abarai turns his sword into a giant segmented snake that attacks his enemiesthe variety of characters in the game is probably its strongest point though this is due more to the series it was based on rather than the game itself
each character has unique abilities there are plenty of regular swordswinging characters but some also have unique twists like extending weapons a bow can only use ranged attacks and one character whose blade heals his enemies so hes forced to use his special attacks only which dont use the sword until he reaches his poweredup form at which point he does massive amounts of damage until it expires
the special attacks and poweredup forms are the primary things that separate the characters though the fact that each character only has one or two special abilities at most in the series somewhat limits how unique they can be
there are  characters in the game over half need to be unlocked by playing through story modes each with their own fairly unique playing stylethere are some extras included in the game as well though the selection is rather poor
you can buy character models and set them as the main menu guide who just stands in the background and lists off the main menu choices as you select them or you can buy new costumes for your characters
however there arent any real new costumes created for the game  rather theyre just costumes that were in the series for short periods of time like the school uniforms that some of the characters wore when visiting the real worldthe problem with the game controlwise is just how poorly the whole rock paper scissors thing works
regular attacks do next to no damage so basically youre just trying to set up for a critical or special attack which vary wildly depending on the characters
characters with longer reaches and particularly characters with extending weapons renji abarai and ikkaku madarame have huge unbalanced advantages  they can swing their weapons with huge ranges with nexttono penalty for doing so
the game is basically a buttonmasher in its purest form except instead of mashing buttons youre waving a wii remote hoping that whatever youre doing is the right type of attack to counter the enemys
just because of how random everything feels the game is incredibly unfun and frustrating to playthe graphics in this game arent great
its obvious they tried to go for an anime style with lots of japanese sound effects and speed lines but overall the game looks like it belongs on a ps or gamecube rather than a current generation console
plus with the speed of movement ingame its hard to even see the effects anyways
one particular annoyance is that in story mode there are cutscenes at the beginning and end
however these cutscenes are actually just a single still image with character voiceovers
the sound isnt great either
the music is lackluster and forgettable and the voice acting doesnt sync up particularly well
i have no problem with the english dub but the way its been put together with the visuals is pretty poor
it feels really awkward and clunkyits difficult to convey how little fun shattered blade is to play
even for a fan of the series its a complete exercise in frustration
the controls are so wonky especially the movement controls which allow you to go forwards and backwards or side to side but not both at the same time meaning you have to run in a zigzag pattern and avoid the invisible walls around the arena that the entire game is just completely unenjoyableim a little disapointed with this game
i mean dont get me wrong or anything i love bleach games
butthis ones kinda a let down
you pretty much move around your arms and if its even a slight flinch of the wii remote then your character will move
at first when i got this i thought that i was going to have tones of fun with itbuti got bored with it in less than a week or two
and dude thats sooo not like me
id play a fighting game for years and never get tired of it
but while i find ichigo rukia ulquiorra grimmjow byakuya gin and uryuus bankais awesomethough hanataros attacks only heal the persons damage and his special move isnt really that great at allstill love him thoughthe rest is sort of skeckty
the story modes are too easy with the same repeated battle ending the arrancar you see on the cover of the game
he does the same based attacks which over time will start to get annoying
and if youve ever played bleach dark souls for the nintendo ds then the voices and some of the pictures are basically from the game
it was a shame that i remembered the voices and all
but if youre a new comer to bleach then you can get this game if you want and give it a try now if youre already familure with bleach then dont get itall i have to say is that the game will basically give your arms the work out they nedd
lolgoods lots of charactersbyakuya
somewhat awesome bankai for some characters
training mode is fine
nice backgroundsbads same voices and pictures from bleach dark souls ds too short of story mode
same battle ending
not enough battle stages for all those charactersif you want to get a good bleach game that you wont get bored with for awhile then get bleach heat the soul  or the whole thing from heat the soul  bleach soul carnival  or  bleach blade battles  or  or bleach the th phantomfirst rp for bleachthe aileron control wheel of my saitek yoke has a large dead zone to the left about  degrees
in other words the airplane would not bank left until i took up the degree slack
there is no dead zone to the right
dead zone is not bad if it is uniformly distributed throughout the control
the operator will soon develope the muscle memory which enables him to move the control just the right amount for the desired effect
but in my case i had to constantly remind myself to add  degrees when banking to the left but be precise when banking to the right
that made landing on narrow gravel strips very difficult
this onesided dead zone is in the hardware no software calibration can eliminate it
setting the ailerons axis sensitivity to maximum and the null zone to zero in my flight simulator x did not help
the elevator control of the saitek yoke sticks
i put a dab of soy oil lub on the shaft but it didnt make any difference
the detached quadrant with programmable buttons is a good design
all the quadrant control levers and the programmable buttons are easily accessible
however due to the substandard performance of the yoke i do not recommend this saitek pro flight yoke with threelever throttle pz to amazon shoppersafter using this yoke for about  months now im back in the market for one that is precise and smooth
this thing has a terribad dead zone for pitch control
the springs used feel really cheap and subtle pitch changes just dont feel right with this product
its built decently and ergonomically not too bad but for the coin im sure there are much betteri dont understand why there are so many positive reviews on amazon for warhammer online
i believed em bought the game and couldnt last more than two days of intense playing  i got a good  hours played inlets look at the main pros that others have mentionedbalanced pvppublic questspvp is balanced only because there are only  classes when it comes down to it  tank dps melee ranged melee ranged caster and healer
they dont vary enough between race  for example there are differences between the shaman and the runepriest but i felt as though i was playing the same character  in pvp you just click the same buttons over and over but the graphicanimation is differentyou get used to seeing the same animation over and over very quickly
people talk about strategy  yes the strategy is to conquer the areas and stay together as a group
thats it stay together as a group  thats the extent of the strategy
this might as well be wow
wellthat was entertaining for the first hour or so i guesspublic quests are interesting until you realize you have to do the same one over and over and it takes eons to form a group
i couldnt believe how lonely i felt in the game
youll see in some other reviews  in general people dont talk in game
i might as well be playing by myself  in fact i will be because this game is going back into the bookshelfoverall this was a very disappointing experience
i stopped playing wow because the pvp was frustrating and unbalancedin my opinion warhammer online does not live up to being the alternative most people are looking forupdateas you can see i got a few comments on this review mostly from people who are obviously enamored of this game
since having initially written the review i got bored and put another  days of playtime in and ultimately got myself up to rank  as a dwarven runepriest having gotten up to  with several other class combinationssome of the comments misinterpreted my statement about forming groupsi know that you can join a group in an area by clicking under your portraitname
that will generally hook you up with  or  other charactersbut it takes a whole heck of a lot more than that to achieve success in your average public quest
also this type of grouping system contributes to the feeling of loneliness i was talking about  with such impersonal grouping youre just lumped together and go around killing things  each player only interested in what loot they can get and not in socializing since they didnt even have to socialize to get into a group to begin with
i hate to talk about socializing this much because i can sense that the fanboy minds out there are just waiting to jump on that  errr maybe you dont like pvp games go back to your chat rooms nub
i bought this game for pvp according to my initial review remember
but pvp aint any fun when you feel like youre playing with a bunch of botsa few others have accused me of not liking mmorpgs
i beta tested and played ultima online i beta tested and played everquest i played world of warcraft i played guild wars and now ive played warhammer online
ive got a decade of mmorpgsit isnt that i dont like them
all of the games i just mentioned are more fun than warhammer online with the exception of guild wars god that sucked
so if you liked guild wars maybe that means youll like this game
faulty logic i know im kidding  in fact let me say it to placate the warhammer online fanboys who think i have nothing good to say  if you liked guild wars youll love warhammer online
buy it nowi stand by my original review  after this latest attempt at playing ive had it just uninstalled this beast
this game is garbage  if they cant make the first  ranks fun im not going to blow another  months in the hopes that the higher levels will somehow be more fun looking at any mmorpg we know that isnt the case  when you max out it just becomes a grindim not going to go into a longwinded review on this one just some sound advice
play the free trial
it is long enough to see everything there is to this game
the pvp is fun for awhile but its the same thing at level  it is at level  graphics may be a bit better than wow but not much
lag is an issue as well even with a pretty decent gaming computer the pvp stuff lags and as said pvp is what the game is about
do the trialif you are a pvper to the core youll love this game
it is very fun in that aspect
if however you are into storylines gorgeous scenery and engrossing questslook elsewhere
for pve it gets old real quick
it simply lacks depth and is not what this game was designed for
its a pvpers dream come true
and its a yawn fest for pveersthe public quest mechanic is just plain awesome but the rewards arent the greatest
named mobs are all overjust dont expect any cool loot from them
at the time of my play the balance was way off
every one wants to play the evil side lame so if you play the good guys prepare to get your butt handed to you at any given time
sure youll squeek in victories here and therebut thats because they were not interested in what ever it was you were taking or busy beating the snot out of you else where
but theyll be back to take what ever it is you got and youll just have to smile and take itmaybe a third raceorder might be a good idea
or balance caps to say not allow  people to register as evil for every  for good
not too hard to do
were sorry the evil to good ratio is at  on this server
please try another server or change alignment
meh who knows
im done and have moved on to play more my styleplain and simple this is not for the pveer like meits for pvpersso for you pvpers buy itlet me first state this
i hate mmos
i hate grinding
but i like endgamepvp and hate pvethe pve pq system is amazing but the mobs are all basically tank n spank and the ai is retardedly lowthe t rvr scenarios are decent
they are fun but bore quickly
they are basically all hold the node games like wows eots without the flagthe t rvr scenarios are terrible
the capture the flag and hold the mountain games are basically the worst wsg matches all balled up into these scenarios
huge turtles with no strategy or point but exactly that turtling
remember how much you hated wsg turtles
well here you have itthere is no instanced pve before level  that i saw
it was all pq
the loot system is very fair and alot of funthe rvr scenario queues for destruction are ridiculous
no instaqueue like wow but you can queue from anywhere as long as you are in the zonewhich sucks you have to fly and pay for flight each time
or you can have a guildie connect to you
i did not play order but if you want fast rvr do not play destruction
 minute waits
this is like wow at its worst
i dont want to play  minutes to play a bgthe world rvr is fun but its luster wears off
its just a huge campfest
one sides pushes to a base then gets beat back by guards
then the other side pushes back and gets beat back by guards
its a pointless tmss all over again
there really is no motivation to take a keep and noone is really caring or doing it yetbut in the end this game is still a huge grind like wow
mythic did not get away from the grind
you have to grind pqs to level up
there is simply not enough quests to just level and stay at your level
and the rvr queues and leveling is just so slow
they really needed cross server battlegroundsmy recommendation wait
this game is not finished and is still a grind
wait until it gets good to waste your time
youre going to spend a good week of played chinese farmers are saying it takes  days to get to i got  free days and ive quit
why
its a grind
i want a game that i can be max level and play and have fun
not kill  wolves for  hours of my life before the game even starts
i am a pvp guy and waiting  minutes for a queue doesnt even cut italso the kicker
if you crashhappened  times to me yesterday over  hours and have a quad  with gtx sli system you get booted to the back of the queue
you want to know how long i had to wait after pm
thirty minutes to play on my serverso my advice is pick order pick a low pop server with high pop destruction or wait till they fxi it with xserver battlegroundsas of now if you like mmos you will like it im sure
but if wow was your first mmo its basically just a slightly improved wow pve wise with more crappy maps and less grinding but still alot of grindingvery good to level  after that some npcs are missing for crafting crafting is bugged any way items disappear when you craft armor etc very heavy lag when trying to take a keepplayers are getting booted to desk top all the time some keeps are buggedother side can shoot through walls and you can notseams like most the problems are after level  i am a healer some level  can kill me very easly and at level  i can not even dammage themea games is trying to fix the bugsservers are down almost every day for a few hoursit now late october and the servers were down every daythis weeki have played since open betaif you are going to playpick a tanki like that class bestif your server is full on one side and the other side is not full the side with the fewer play get a bonus of  exp etcupdate late october oh yeah players are still getting booted to desk top all the timei think they do it to stop the lagrun on a ghz intel with g ram geforce  video current drivers win xp sp
using the white tower serverthis game runs like a dog
the disk is thrashing continuously yes i have defragged it and the lag is abysmal
the whole game runs like wow if on a busy day
it crashes periodically once every  hours with no error message
some areas are so dark you cant see a thing but there is no way to adjust the brightness
i got spammed by gold diggers within  minutes of starting play and i can find no way to ignore players report spam or any of the things i expect to be able to do
in fact the game is most noticable for all the things the player cannot doone other thing is the mob respawn rate is way too high
several times i got agroed by  mobs and by the time i killed the third the first one had respawned and agroed again
i estimate the respawn time is about  seconds for many of the mobs
perhaps mythic thought a lot more people would be playing but there are very few players aroundthe graphics arent really that good either  not noticably better or worse that wowbetter than potc worse that lotr much worse than wowi liked a few things about this game
the map highlights the areas that your open quests reference
now that i think about it that was the only thing so far i likeive own this game since retail launch and have resubscribed  time to see if the game has improved over the course of several months
to me nothing has changed
put wow and camelot in a blender and this is game will be the outcomecons the game is not fun
it lacks depth that most mmos have
the tugowar backbone is mind numbing and feels like nothing is ever getting done
there is still a lack of communication with other players
with everyone and their me me me attitude just drives you nuts
excessive aggros from baddies at lower levelspro nice graphics a solid warhammer feel endless pvp  assuming it is your cup of teano thanks to this one
i miss the older games that were more about skating and less about dumb crazy over the top stunts to get millions of points
the tony hawk games have really lost it for meafter playing this game at my friends apartment i was mixed about the online gameplay
far too easy yet realistic to die
the categories of guns range from close range to long range yet the bullets are  accurate if single fired at any range from any weapon through most objects
the story mode is good but let me lay down the facts that this game does very little to offer anything new to the table on any front
graphics are clunky and clay like which the  suffers from the ai and enemy units for single players seem to have active gps devices with your location while being stamped out of a nearby factory like gnats
the story is ok not moving in any regard
for online people are classically praying and spraying their guns with random effects
boring maps with the same old crap
everything is colored the same and bumped the same yes realistic but again adding to the oh hey i found you let me pray and sprayi was first addicted to this game but after  months im ready to trade it in and move on to something other then a saturated market of fpsfirst off i want to go on record as not being a halo or half life  fanboy
i am more of an action and rpg fan if anything
please keep that in mind before sending me any nastygram repliesi fail to understand the overstated hype that cod has generated from video game critics and players alike
from either single player or multiplayer perspectives half life  halo  and bioshock are far superiorhere are the pros and consprosgraphics  no doubt this game looks great though not as good as bioshocksound  great sound effects and voiceacting again though not as good as any of the shooters i have already mentionedcons and there are manygameplay  tight shooting controls but what is up with the enemies that respawn in perpetuity until you cross some invisible line on the map
for a game that sells itself on realism that is quite hokey
the fact that you have to hold down one of the joysticks to run faster is quite clumsy
i liked the semisnap to enemy function but it just doesnt beat the megatight controls in halflife  as well as the other games in the orange boxweapons  though the guns look and sound great the aforementioned shooters weapons are better
yes those games have the creative advantage of fictional weapons but this reviewer appreciates playing a video game more for the fantastical elements as opposed to realism
even if we just compare the more realistic weapons the main machine gun in half life  especially in episode  trumps any of cods machine guns
it just feels incredible to weild that puppy from a video game perspectivemultiplayer  maybe its just me and the fact that i am old but i really do appreciate the wonderful simplicity that halo  offers in the ease of understanding that i have to shoot the guy on the screen whos color is opposite of my teams
i could never figure out who the heck the enemy was in cod until i was pwned as the kids like to say
the enemys uniform was the same color as my teams
yes thats more realistic but who the heck wants that in a video game apparently everyone but methere you have it
i just can not recommend this game
if you are looking for great shooters on xbox  there are three of them out there that are top notch orange box the half life  series halo  durrr and bioshockspiderman has tended to have a pretty decent track record over the past few years in the video game arena with the earlier released spiderman  being the only real disappointment
spiderman friend or foe attempts to put a different spin on the spideybrawler formula but sadly the end result is pretty disappointing and above all its pretty lame
friend or foe begins with an interesting enough premise someone is using symbiotecontroled villains to wreak havoc and head of shield
nick fury has recruited spidey to take them on and team up with his various rogues in an attempt to take down the mystery villain behind it all
teaming up with the green goblin doc ock and more
it sounds great on paper but what kills friend or foe is how ungodly boring the games action elements are
beat up one group of baddies move on to another repeat
this is basically the whole concept of friend or foe
now i like beat em ups as much as the next guy but friend or foe is so easy to breeze through and filled with a number of technical glitches that youll be left wondering why you picked the game up in the first place
i know the ps is showing its age more than ever these days but friend or foe offers a choppy frame rate fuzzy graphics and overly bland environments
there are some secret rooms and hidden features to find and the voice acting is pretty good as well but as far as positives go thats all she wrote
all in all spiderman friend or foe is a disappointingly lame and overly boring beat em up that fails to live up to the promise of the licenseif you like call of duty multiplayer avoid this game
unfortunately the multiplayer for modern warfare modern warfare  and world at war are completely ruined by hackers
if youre looking just to play the single player or play private multiplayer then your fine but if youre thinking of playing online be ready for a huge disappointmentpersonally i feel activision should not sell the map packs online because of the hackers personally i spent  for the map packs for games that are unplayable
the hackers have infinite health god mode unlimited ammo its ridiculous
for example i give you this when you start a game but theres instantly kill streaks attacking you because of course they have unlimited kill streaks at the beginning of the game
and you want to be careful playing with hackers because you never know what they could do to your accountits really unfortunate because i love the call of duty series and the multiplayer games are unplayable so save your money pleasethanks for readingps please like this post so it can float to the toponce socom confrontations comes out on june th get ready to find no one online in codfor those of you still thinking of buying this for a cheap guitar to use with newer guitar hero games i urge you to think twice
the quality of this guitar is so frighteningly poor that im literally throwing it away today and ordering a gh guitar
it just does not work properly
it frequently misses notes and today just wont maintain a connection
do a google search and you will find that this bundle is infamous for faulty guitars
spend the extra money for a gh bundle it is worth itfirst the guitar is not compatible with any prior gh game
indefensible problem   second like others i find it unresponsive compared to the original guitar
third in all prior gh games i could  star all but the top tier songs on expert
in gh hard mode is equal to expert in the previous games and i wont even try expert which i assume is unplayable
instead of an immersive experience im furious while playing it over the blatant way the game is designed to be inaccessible even to experienced players
theres no feeling like youre playing the song when you cant hit any notes in succession
hammerons and pulloffs are as hard now as the original and since they make up massive sections of songs those songs are worthless
plus you cant play sabotage wout another player
are they trying to turn us away
avoid this and hope rock band gets it rightfirst of all the fact that the game has bad graphics does not helpand what do they do they make the game too short
the location choices were terrible i think they could take the time to make good locations
the attacks are bad
hello
new goblin and green goblin cannot throw pumpkin bombs and fly on their goblin glidersits ok to see the kiddies playing with this but full grown twenty somethings its just sad i mean how many frustrated musicians are there in this countrythis game involves the devillots of people love this but it is not for kids under thats what i think
a big fat  is what the age is forif you want to kill your kids imagination go right ahead or make our father sad
please get this game away from kids under  my daughter tia played it at a friends house
then we saw the video
dont hurt your brain or your lifei bought this for myself because my brother owned it and would bring it over and i would get hooked on playing it
but now years later all it does is sit in my closet collecting dust
i dont think anyone still plays anymore
the craze is over
anyone want to buy my junk
hahathe first thing that i noticed when i purchased this today was the limited edition pasted on the cover
i scratched my head and looked for the regular edition
there isnt one
i know ea is as corporate as video games get so i shrugged off this cheap move
after all the game still cost 
i brought it home with my hopes high since ive liked previous dice games battlefield  bad company   
i sat down ready to dig into the multiplayer and immediately ran into server issues
the ea servers couldnt handle the workload
there were only  players
granted its day one but ive seen over  million players very early on in halo games
the error message told me to go to eacom for more information so i did
were trying to fix the servers was their revelation
no kidding
thanks for wasting more of my time
i decided to try the campaign
it opens with a view from a satellite orbiting the earth and recordings of peoples reaction to the  terrorist attacks
i thought it was pretty bold and hoped ea had done a decent job of respecting the victims of the attack
they fell a little short
the campaigns first few levels are linear and derivative
i quickly realized the game is trying to copy the call of duty series only it isnt nearly as exciting
the first mission has you trying to find an informant hidden in afghanistan and it lasted about twice as long as it needed to
i dont even remember what i did on the second mission
i know it was at the kandahar airport and featured a boneyard of derelict aircraft parts
a blatant ripoff of call of duty modern warfare   the gameplay was alright but there were too many errors to keep me into the game
enemies would literally appear in front of me as i aimed down my iron sights
im not sure if this was some sort of glitch but they would just appear behind cover
so i would shoot them
ai
seemed to be lacking as well enemies would ignore me killing all of their buddies as they stood there doing nothing
they wouldnt react until i shot them
i spent the normal amount of time going through the menus and setting up display sound and controller settings
i took a break for dinner then decided to try multiplayer again
the servers were doing better up to  players now and i was happy to get into a game
i made my way through the archaic menu system and finally spawned on the battlefield
i ran straight ahead and hid behind a rock
none of my controllerscreenaudio settings had transferred from single player
i tried to fix the controls and was blown away to find that you cant have the same configuration as the single player game
the controls are different from battlefield what im used to and of the four controller options two are set up for leftys
that leaves two useable configurations depending on which hand you use and they literally only change one button
i cannot believe you arent allowed to have the same controller configuration in multiplayer that you have in single player
idiotic
once i got into the games i was faced with more cod garbage
sniping and spawncamping are extremely prevalent even on day one
plan to start sprinting the moment you spawn because if you dont youll be dead
even then youre lucky to make it to cover
its a highintensity online game somewhere between halo and the cod series
i opted for the shotgun or the sniper rifle since they seemed like my best chances for survival
with countless camping spots sniping is easy and if you want to runandgun the shotgun does the most damage
medium range rifles seemed pretty worthless as you would have to stop to shoot for more than half a second
which means death
the play was very laggy especially when bullets started flying
id run around a corner shotgun ready only to have the game glitch out on me as soon as i pointed it at an enemy
i died a lot because shots didnt register when i pulled the trigger
i dont think i need to tell you how frustrating this wasoverall im quite disappointed
ill continue playing the game in the hopes that it gets better with updates but as of right now id encourage others to stay away from it
its quite a mess and unacceptable in its current state
it seriously feels like its not complete
i dont know if ea deliberately released it this way expecting to fix it with updates but it would be pretty lame if they didimo a disappointing game overall
sloppy and clunky controls tedious sp missions glitchy in both sp and mp save your money for black ops or bfas a singleplayer gamer i normally love moh games airborne is one of my alltime favorites but this game is nothing at all like airborne
its actually too much like call of duty
your players movement is confined to a very limited area of play and the game dictates where when and how to advance as well as what weapons you will use to eliminate enemies
in other words you have very little freedom of choice in this game
you cannot go about completing objectives on your own terms  you must follow the script of the game to the letter in order to advance through missions
i find that to be no fun at allthere are no weapons upgrades to earn no med kits to find no bonuses no secrets to unlock or hidden places to discover etc
theres literally nothing interesting to do in this game
all you can do is follow the yellow brick road and adhere to the tightlyregimented script
after playing the game for about two hours i was so bored i quit and deleted the game from my consolethe graphics are phenomenal
the game is a lot like a movie
unfortunately moh put so much into the cinematics and realism they forgot to make the game fun for the gamergraphics sound authenticity realism gameplay overall the singleplayer is good but isnt worth buying the game for
its short and isnt even worth it
just buy the book lone survivor or roberts ridge to see what the singeplayer is aboutthe multiplayer is a mix of bf and cod
a bad one at that
there is no destruction its extremely hard to see people snipers are overpowered the bradeley is underpowered there is no map variety its just literally a cluster of generic desert maps
the gun selection and customization is cookie cutter at best and crap
the only good guns are the m m and m
everthing else is tacked onjust buy bf
moh is crapi had such high hopes for this game and was let down big time
the single player is horrible
it plays like a xbox  or ps game and the graphics suck
the story is decent but like every other fps game coming out is very short and beatable in a few hours
the sound is the only thing that i liked from the sp
the multiplayer is again decent and that is all
in no way better than cod mw
ea and its online pass to play multiplayer was a bad move as well
overall i am so disapointed in this title for i had such high hopes and once i got the final product it sucks
wait til this one is  or  dont bother paying full pricewell to start off i will say that the game is fun
i really enjoyed the campaign and the multiplayer is fun
and i would like to give the game a better rating but cannot
here is whythe single player campaign is way to short
i played on hard an finished the game in about  hours
this is on hard
had i played on normal it would have went even quicker
the tier one mode is pretty cool but is also far to simple in many ways
the controls and graphics are top notch but the content is just to littlethe multiplayer is a real disappointment
no not because i do not like it or because it is not fun
it is because of connection issues
 different times now i have not been able to connect do to server issues
i go to the games forum at ea and the issue has been widespread each time
me and my son where playing together and i get removed from the game
we had just started and had played roughly half a match
he is still in the game and playing while i get the error message that the master server is down
i have not been able to play a game since
for  days now
and  other times i have had server error messages and been unable to play that day or longer
this happens way to often
i wonder how many will just give up on this game before it is finally fixed if it ever isi have to say i would not recommend this game for the mp and would not recommend it for the campaign until you can get it for about  at the mostnot my favorite game
not good shooting experience
a little hard to move the character where you want them to go
hoping the nd game is betterprobably the people who does medal of honor should retire or change occupation
the publicity or advertising that this game recieved and the way it looked in the trailer doesnt do justice with all the amount of bugs this game has with how incredibly short the single player campaign is and with the not such good graphics
on the good part in my opinion the game captures the wilderness crazy and difficult of the combat thats taking place in afghanistanmy wife got me this for xmas because i had been playing cod black ops
honestly its a big letdown
the classesgun options are limited
the graphics are terrible
i honestly cant make out whether an object is an enemy combatant or a pixelated box until its too late half the time
while it sucks to be a noob in most games like this it really sucks in this game because not only do you have to learn the maps guns games etc but this game limits you to basically  gun options that you may or may not like right off the bat
you have to dredge through many games of getting your butt handed to you by players with nice scopes light machine guns etc before you can finally unlock some nice items
it also seems very laggy
sometimes you have to hit a button like to respawn  times before the game actually does it
just not that impressed in comparison to the cod games on xboxi really  really wanted to like this game
i thought that the single player would be a really good story with some great action that would provide quite a challenge
not
i even thought the graphics would be amazing which is not that big of a deal  but the graphics really are pathetic
not up to par with bfbc or mw
i kept thinking they would get better  but it did not
this is the easiest and most boring single player campaign that ive ever played
i just cant describe it
i really am not that good at games  but on normal difficulty level there is no challenge at all and i really dont want to mess with the hard level
the missions are boring and the story is as well
there are some attempts to make the gameplay diverse with some air strikes and stuff  but it just doesnt work
i guess maybe it might be more realistic in the sense of warfare and missions not that i would know  but it doesnt make for a good game to me
so freaking easy it just doesnt do it
ok the multiplayer is really good  but its no better that bfbc in my opinion
there are lots of reasons to like the multiplayer  like not getting blistered with noob toobs ever  seconds  but expect to get your ice sniped off a lot
it could be said that i havent given it a fair shot for the mp  but i just want to sell it and wait for black ops
it is more intense  but it seems that they just made the maps smaller
if black ops wasnt coming out soon  id probably play this mp more  but ill just stick with mw until nov th
yes  mw has its flaws and cheaters  but its still a good time killer
thankfully i saved  bucks with a previous game preorder and  bucks with this one for black ops  but its not worth even   maybe   but ill bet it hits that price soonso after all the hype and expecting a game to build off of call of dutys flaws it doesnt even come close
i was so disappointed that i blew  i didnt even finish the game before i traded it in
just another rehash first person shooter with very linear maps and very linear gameplay
when will game developers learn that we want a little freedom and a little creativity to wander around customize our characters and be able to win a scenarios in a variety of different ways
moh does not offer any of that and the multiplayer is just a chaotic mess
this game does not even come close to letting you do anything special or tier one
all that hype was a bunch of bs
those who have served in a combat unit know this is just a shallow attempt to earn  by hyping the game with all the sf and tier one garbage
and i actually agree with the us army that this game is made in poor taste and boycott it allowing players to play as the taliban or so called opfor when so many soldiers have died at the hands of those dirtbags
in my opinion the perfect fps game would be a mix of operation flashpoint dragon rising and rainbow six vegas  as for moh for the xbox  dont waste your money like i didthe  stars is for the campaign
at the beginning it was very accurate
from the clothes and hats but they do not speak arabic
they speak pashtu or farsi
it was also very glitchy at times you didnt know what to do you just wonder around then it finally comes around
but it is a good but short campaign
and now to the multiplayeri shot a guy in the head  times at once and he was still alive
i shot a grenade launcher round and hit a guy in the face and he still lived
you also spawn in the same spot and can get killed as soon as you respawn
it happened to me
id rather play halo reach and i hate the halo games
so that should tell you something
wait for black opsgraphics are ok till the developers got cute with the scope views scopes are not fisheye and actually make things clearer
other visual effects night vision fog sandstorms are a poor effort at trying to make this game challenging
story line is soso and could have been much better had developers utilized just one character for the player to relate to
atv operation is really squirrelly
basically the game is a vido and youre just along for the ride
player has few options and very limited mobility harking back to the days of yore when you trodded down the designated path from one video display to the next
not my idea of a fun eveningthats all it took one  hour evening to play the campaign mode and its over and that includes way to many reboots to overcome ingame clitches
wish i had my money back
save yours and spend it on a more deserving gameit was fun at first
i love the characters and the story is interesting butthere is a major con to this game that if you dont form a good party and stick with it youre screwed because there is no ability to grind to improve your levels before you move on
so if you didnt manage to get to a decent level before some boss fight
too bad youre screwed
either start over the whole game from scratch or just keep trying to fight the boss over and over and hope you eventually get really luckyatlus first touch detective for the ds had an undeniable charm but alas was too linear and shallow for its own good
touch detective   is no different as it offers more of the same in terms of gameplay and presentation which makes it basically the same game youve played before
now this may not be such a bad thing for those who actually enjoyed the first game but for the rest of us theres really nothing to see here
young and touchy detective mackenzie returns to solve the five cases that make up touch detective   and depending on how much you enjoyed the first game will decide how much you enjoy this outing
like the previous game touch detective  s most entertaining moments come from interrogating various people thanks to the insanely hilarious dialogue and mackenzies own inner thoughts
the art style still offers plenty of charm and personality even though most of it is used again from the last game
what really kills touch detective   are the same things that did in the previous installment the repetitive and shallow gameplay and just plain inane puzzle elements
combine these with the overly linear feel of the game and you get pretty much what we got the last time around
the first touch detective was a surprise hit when released and for those who enjoyed that game youll probably dig this sequel to some extent
for the rest of us though touch detective   is best left on the shelfthe game wasnt made by the same people who made mx vs atv unleashed
it felt very inferior compared to unleashed
the graphics is fair but not great
the sound is good
the music is ok  plenty of game modes
but the gameplay is bad
the controls dont feel tight
the vehicles feel like they bounce a lot and acts like there is less gravity on the ground
when you drive of a hill it feels like your floating in the air
and thats not gooddont get this game
your losing your money buying this game
instead get mx vs atv unleashedmx vs atv untamed is the latest installment in thqs long running atv racing series and its starting to show its age on the ps
where this is the most noticable is with the games graphics engine which just looks dated beyond belief
this wouldnt be much of a problem were it not for the bevy of graphical glitches and clipping that occurs throughout the variety of races featured in mx vs atv untamed
where the game also suffers is with the uninspired unvaried race track design and the poor unresponsive controls
there are a few good points to be found with mx vs atv untamed though including a pretty good soundtrack and a large selection of events and options to choose from
the racing action itself is decent but the flaws in the games presentation are what really stop mx vs atv untamed from being a decent enough racer
all in all thqs long running racing series really shows its age on the ps with mx vs atv untamed and it goes without saying that if the ps is your only option previous installments in the series are a better and much safer bet than thisi found this game for wii and i was so excited because i didnt know they made it for wii
so i bought it
i went home and played it right away for hours
i absolutely loved this game
then i started noticing bad things
since youre pressing the a button almost the whole time in the game it started ruining the button on the controller
so now i have to press the button really hard to accelerate which is ruining the button even more
then ive found many glitches in the game
sometimes the bike randomly starts jumping and it doesnt accelerate
im not sure about atvs because i never race them
my final complaint is the races you have to do at night
why would you race at night with no lights
you cant even see the screen
im very dissapointed in this game
companies that make games seem to not make them as well for wii as they do xbox or psive played this for xbox  and its way better for xbox
however ive never played this for ps but im sure its much betterthe fun part about this game is beating up the driverthe negative part of this game is the controls are impossible
youll make your guy go left and youll take a super sharp turn right into the wall and then youll crack up because all the people behind you will just run over your character as if they dont give a crap that hes dying
another thing i dont like is the music its people screaming their heads off for no apparent reason
you cant even understand themseveral of the stuff packs for this game have a great deal going for them but this one isnt one of them
the clothing and hairstyles are the best part the furniture and objects not so much
the piles of dirty clothing on the floor are especially worthless completely flat with no definition whatsoever
sims addicts will want to collect it and teens might really enjoy it
but i dont think it was worth the original asking price by a long shot
if its gone on sale grab it
if not pass this one by you wont miss iti only played this for a short time before i had to return it
after playing the main just bowling part i didnt bother with the mini gamescharacters stereotypical of country girl inner city guy selfcentered girl etc
all the girls being dressed so all their assets are on display
they all say annoying obnoxious stereotypical things for goodbad throws
the acting is very poorlaughable  best to put that on mute which you have the option of thankfullygraphics i do like that the ball goes down the lane much faster then wii sports bowling thats the only positive i can give other then different choices in the locations
though the graphics felt cluttered distracting  flatdead
you can hit a to speed through the replay etc
just like wii sportsoptions sxf sounds character voices  music volume
bowling tournament mini games
play up to  people with  or  remotes can also decide how many computer players
total  of players computer or human is  i believe
game play when lining up your shot its like youre a little kid looking over the characters shoulder which is very annoying
you cant really get a feel from feet to pins
does that feel realistic
who plays peering over a shoulderi have to admit when my remote hit my leg or something it did count it as a foul
but otherwise i didnt feel it responded to my different ways of handling it
it always curved way too much even if looking down my remote was pointed in the opposite direction
it never let me get a strike even though the ball was thrown powerfully enough
it would hit it dead center but the two pins on the furthest sides wouldnt go down
i tried slamming it  the video never showed the ball going fastersome video on youtube com  reviews on ign gamespot  gamefly who wrote reviewsas being a person who bowls in leagues year around i thought it would be nice to have taste of bowling in my house that goes beyond the wii sports bowling
i was looking forward to having to really work up my virtual bowling skills in tournaments to achieve more awards and unlock areas  however this is not the game for thatthis game is more so for fun when you have a couple of your friends over and you want to play a bowling game without having to create a mii on the wii for your friends
now i will say that the characters are boring and they will annoy you if you dont turn down the volume  even the music is cheesy
but come onthis is a game for  bucks so out the box you should deem it to be weak in naturei will say this  controlling the wii remote for this game is the same as when you play the wii sports bowling  the brunswick bowling which i think has more of the overall skill level play has horrible wii remote control
you have to manipulate the wii remote in some funky odd sort of wayso if you looking for something to do when youre just bored out of your mind  perhaps this game will reel you in for some fun for about  to  minutes or somy edition also came with one free game for up to four people at any amf bowling center  whoo hoo  okay i was trying to be sarcastic
lol you can find this game for free for the pc so if youre reading this review using the internet you are also able to install and play this game ten minutes from now
if you want to play n on the go then buy this gameway to hard to unlock at  titles
the nostalga wears off pretty fastthis is a mediocre collection of many good games hampered by numerous interface and design problemsthe evolved games use the same ugly graphics as the xbox  arcade ports
thats well and good but i really expected better treatment of the classic games since weve seen good collections from namco and capcom
for both the classic and evolved versions of the arcade games the graphics are letterboxed so the oncebeautiful vector lines are rasterized and almost as ugly as the gameboy advance  collection of atari games
the psp is capable of so much morecompared to the atari anthology collection on ps and xbox a few years ago there are multiple games missing such as space duel and red baron
however there are multiple ways to play pong on this discthe vertical games tempest centipede millipede are vertical only requiring you to rotate the psp in an awkward position like the optional modes in some other psp games
even in this orientation they still dont scale up to fill the whole screen like the namco museum battle collection did so many years agoone of the major points of interest for me is that there are over  atari  vcs games on the disc
there are some good atari properties missing star raiders secret quest and solaris are sadly absent for example
thats not a big surprise but the disappointing part about this feature is that the player must unlock these old games  all at once  by laboriously getting every award from every arcade game  in all
i suspect that any arcade fan with that level of skill or interest would already have these games in another format by nowconsidering ataris financial state i worry that this could be the last major retro release from the company
its a shame because the company has released vastly superior products in the past namely the atari flashback  plugandplay console with  new and old games with authentic controls the atari anthology collection for playstation  and xbox with more arcade games better graphics a more reasonable unlocking scheme and i resolution on the xbox and xbox  compatible versioni suggest passing on this retro collection in favor of the better packages out there capcom namco taito and activision have all done a better job on the psp in my humble opinion
this one is for completists onlywho wouldnt want these games in their back pocket to play at any given moment right
and at that price its got to be a stealhold on to those nine bucks friends this game has two distinct problems one in every version and one specific to the pspthe general problem is that while the game touts atari  games at your beck and call you have to unlock them by playing the marquee games
and not incrementally but en toto
you have to clear all of the roadblocks for all of the games or you dont get any  games at all
so even if you never liked say warlords you have to jump its hurdles to get any  games to unlockthe psp specific problem is that some of these games are cocktail table style which means you have to turn the psp on its end to play some of the games
ever tried playing something on its end thats not designed to play on its end
its excrutiatinga better buy on a console platform all the way
on psp
skip it
as much i want more psp games this one is too little of a good thingnice looking guitar and everything felt and worked good except for the strum bar
that felt very soft like mush and very slow acting
i know why its like that as its a new design since being sold seperately
i took apart the guitar and the strum bar plastic piece rides on actual foam pieces and hits more foam on each side at max travel
had to return itwhile wireless controllers are a nice idea sometimes proper quality parts are not used in order to save money
i recently got one of these as part of a rock band package ps version of game drums guitar micprosthe guitar has a nice size and weight to itit came with batteries a rare thingonoff switch excellent for maximizing battery lifethe fret buttons click loudlythe strum bar doesnt click good if you dont like the clickiness of the strum bar on guitar hero controllersno cordconsfor the tiltoverdrive function to work you need to tilt the controller very vertical very quickly if you dont get it up enough quickly enough it cant tell that youve tilted itthe fret buttons click loudlythe strum bar doesnt click bad if you like the clickiness of the strum bar on guitar hero controllersthe wireless isnt great it drops a note every so often while playing
i do not have an interference issue as my regular wireless controllers work fine
i know its dropping a note when a note doesnt get played that i know i defiantly hit or when a hold down note drops off halfway through while im still holding the button downthe console dongle is a little box with a  inch usb cable when i plug it in i then have to find someplace to put the thing so its not just dangling of the front of the consoleafter having this controller drop  notes in a song i went back to playing with the original wired red guitar hero guitar with a controller extension cable
i get the same freedom of range as the wireless controller with no dropped notes
 dongle is a term for a device you plug into a computer or device to enable a function it wouldnt normally have a usb flash drive can be called a dongle
this review may only be legally shown directly on amazoncomthe rock band wireless guitar has the look of a real fender strat and is noticeably bigger than any guitar hero controller
it definitely feels less like a toy than its competition
however performance is ultimately what matters and in this realm it falls shortboth the strum bar and the fret buttons feel radically different from the gh controller
after using both for a while the gh controller lends itself to better accuracy and higher scores
the strum bar on the rb guitar is freefloating ie
there is no clicking into place with each strum
i find that the clicking provides your strum hand with necessary feedback on when a note has been registered
youll miss a few here and there on the rb guitar as a result
but the real crime is the fret buttons
theyre nicelysized covering the entire fret so i expected the rb guitar to shine here
however they actually do click and click hard into and out of place with each press
plus the plastic is strangely sticky compared to the much slicker buttons on the gh controller
all of this combines into more difficult gameplay which makes the rb controller less useful and fun to playthe rb guitar adds some bellsandwhistles functionality like an effects switch and high fret buttons but theyre just unnecessary gimmicks
each of the effects just make your playing sound bizarre because their depth is way too deep
the high fret buttons can be used to solo with one hand ie
no strumming necessary but its more of a hassle than it initially sounds
the buttons are awkward to reach its difficult to move from the lower to the higher button sets on faster songs that transition quickly tofrom the solos and ultimately it diminishes the feel and fun of actually playing guitarmuch like the drum kit for rock band this peripheral needed a little more time on the design table
rock band may be the superior game but the instrument controllers just arent up to parpros  unibody construction has a good solid feel compared to the detachable neck of the gh guitar  large fullfret buttonscons  stickyclicky buttons coupled with floating strumbar greatly diminish gameplay performance  control configuration is tough for lefties to use  incompatible with guitar hero gamesjust like everyone else we had trouble with the tilt switches on our wireless guitars
my brotherinlaw bought two one for him and one for me
the one he bought for himself wouldnt boost no matter how he shook tweaked tilted or swung his guitar
he could only get it to boost by hitting the good old fashioned start buttonthe one he bought for me was the exact opposite
every time you breathed it boosted on you
you didnt have to tilt at all and whampower boost
you could ever get more than half a bar stored up because as soon as you did the guitar would boost on you whether you wanted it to or not
in a way this was worse than no boosting because you could hit start to make it boost when it wasnt responding you couldnt hit a stop button to make it not boostwe returned both of them and stick with the wired controllerswhich is a painthe real drag was that we waited several months to try and buy these
a lot of reviews said the first batch had the problem and newer ones were fixed
i just dont buy this
ours were a newer batch that we bought from a local store and had just come on the truck in that dayi didnt give the product one star because the wireless feature seemed to work well with no snags
also they redesigned the wammy bar on this model so it doesnt accidentally hit the start button or trip up your effects switch quite as easily so well done there
those upsides just dont outweigh the negative here however
like others say buy at your own risk
im tempted to wait for nyco or madcatz to release an off brand one and see if it works any betteri should have known better
many other people have already commented on how poor the tilt sensor works in these things
mine is a perfect example of this  i have never been able to trigger star power by tilting my wireless controller
aside from that the controller works well
very frustrating for this aging wannabe rockerok as pc games go now daysbut all the good games are made for consolesrockstar no longer even bothers with pc games and only make them for consolesi know this will upset many hard core pc gamers of which i am one but it is truemost all the games for the pc are just console games adapted to play on the pc to rake in the pc dollarsthen thy play very badlyi want to play manhunt gta and bully but thy are only on consolespc gamming is a dying breed and it really makes me madit plays exactly like counter strike
the maps are small and has tons of close quater action
if you like counter strike you will love this one
as for me there is none better then battlefield to me bf game play is ten times more funi have not played any of the call of duty series before but picked this up on the advice of a friend
everyone seems to think this is amazing and pc powerplay even gave it  though pc mags reviews often mean little
overall i found the game to be a fairly average offering and here are my reflections for those considering a purchasestability stable did not experience any crashes whilst playing
played on vista  q gm ram x gt in sligraphics for those with powerful systems cod is the equivalent of games coming out in late early  the strength of the graphics are in the textures but there are limited shadows lighting effects or any of the more advanced graphical techniques that we see in more recent titles
the reduced effects means that the game will scale very will on almost any system but as a result looks similar to titles from two years ago
graphically it reminds me of the second splinter cell game so thats the comparison and while not up to todays standards they are still reasonablesound for the most part actually pretty weak but it serves its purpose
grenades make the same sound no matter what substance they land on and guns sound very light and unrealistic but nevertheless it is passable for what it is trying to achievegameplay now this is where i have struggled to get the concept
in most games to move forward you have to complete the objective kill the bad guys complete some task etc and this is true from half life  fear crysis farcry quake etc
in cod this is different in cod the objective is to move forward in fact actually completing any other task is pointless and often counterproductive
you can kill all of the bad guys that you want but they just respawn in an endless supply
the way to eliminate your enemies and to stop them from respawning is to simply move forward
if you move forward then the enemy stops respawning and your team mates of which you have no control kill cover
for me this meant that i never felt like i was contributing to the actions of the story but rather following it along and hence wrecking the immersion factor
if you shoot anyone then you risk being shot so better not to shoot anyone
there is a sniper level where you have to wait for a helicopter whilst being swarmed by never ending enemies  since it is pointless killing anyone since they respawn what to do
simply lie down in the ticket booth until the helicopter arrives  and solutions like this are on almost every level
there are some levels that where quite good namely taking over the gunners position from an ac this reminded me of a youtube video of such an action and was well done however the shooting component of the game was merely a means to tell a story but a passive story rather than one that you get the writelength i played through the single player on hardened mode and managed to finish the game in about  hours
there was little challenge as it is more of an experience rather than something that you have to work for
multiplayer can extend it a little more but due to the missing coop play i found multiplayer to be inferior to that of rv so unless someone at a lan party wants to enforce this game there is more fun elsewherereplayability negligible
they provide an arcade mode so that you can replay with cheats and the like but really the whole game is arcade
the more impressive cheat is unlimited ammo but since you are carrying around  rounds of ammo with two weapons anyway this seems kinda redundant as i was never in danger of running out of ammo in single playerverdict i really want to give this a  but i gave bioshock a  and bioshock is a better game than cod
maybe it is just me but i like to feel that i am actually contributing to the outcome of the game rather than just being taken along for a ride
hence i feel like i was being taken along for an overpriced movie presentationmy current fps ranking of recent shooters that i have played crysis rainbow six vegas fear quake  halflife  bioshock call of duty great graphicsthat is all that is good about this gamethere is no real story lineno interactionno stealthno suspenceit is just shootshootshootyou get out in the middle of a firefight and move and shoot targetsyou have to pretty much stay with the team because you can not even open doorsbullets are comming from every direction but if you get hit just go prone and in a couple of seconds you are well againif a grenade icon comes on the screen just runreally not much to this game and after a few missions it gets pretty boeringnothing to drive or flyjust run and gunthis game must be popular with on line players to get all these rave reviews because the single player leaves a lot to be desiredi gave it  stars but i was being generousi do not recomend this game for a player who playes in single modgreat graphics limited game play options
it bothers me that i am limited by the games internal borders
if you could jump over a ft wall in one area why not all the rest
if i have found a weapon that i like i would not expect it to disappear in the next scene only to be replaced by an inferior oneif i wanted to sit through movies i would buy a dvd
this game is riddled with them
who wants to sit there for  min while the dumb movie plays out
i buy games so i can play them not to watch moviesi have to call it as i see it
i really think the team behind the cod franchise needs to be wiped clean and new people need to be brought incod  has been modernized
no more ww
great
i love ww games but it was time for a change in cod
that is it
nothing else is newyou still cannot shut the music off during game play
ultra annoying to many people out there
what is the harm of giving people a choice
nope the ego centric nature of activision wont allow that
i had to hack the files of cod cod and now i will have to hack the files again to shut the music offi have nothing against the music i just dont like it on
i like the combat sound effectsagain the cod game play is nothing but run and gun and it is again scripted
achieve a goal or move your character to a certain spot and events occur
this makes a game so darn predictable that replay value goes down the tubesi am not impressed with the graphics either
they seem outdated stale
there are too many other games out there with nicer details and realistic features
cod  is not one of themthis game is not worth the high price tag they have slapped it with
no way
i recommend you borrow a friends copy install it play it and if you still want to buy it go for it
it is too soon to tell if the multiplayer will be worthwhile
there were a lot of claims that the cod  mp was outstanding and a tremendous success yet the servers were empty
hop on a  year old ut  server and it is still jamming with actionno the cod franchise is at the end
they really need to rebuild from the ground up
there is a ton of potential but it is not here in this releasethis game is amusing for perhaps the first ten minutes
then you realize the entire thing is finding very well hidden objects in attractively rendered though lifeless backgrounds
you do that several times in a row and occasionally do one other type of puzzle the only other type
the second kind is roughly like a jigsaw but less fun and with clumsy handling
as you complete more puzzles you get morehints
im not sure what it is
its mostly meaningless and short scripts some factual buut not very interesting and some about charactersthough there is no development to these personagesor a story really
its all pointless and neither challenging nor easy
it is simply repetitive
if you want brainy games something with a story something with characters or any interest at all try something else
its not worth the money or time
avoid similar games by this companysoldier of fortune  had heart and soul
this game might as well be called soldier street fighter in as much as it feels more like an arcade game than a fps following a story line
example at the end of each mission you face down ther boss guy who requires a zillion shots to kill like some big boss on the old quarter arcade games
graphics are good but if youre looking for a game like the first two with characters and a story you care about you will not find it in this gamestay away from this guitarit is a good  inches smaller than the standard one and is of a much cheaper construction
my yellow button stopped working  months after purchasing itspend a little more money and buy the original guitarthis order i had problem with due to sellernot amazon finally got guitar thanks to amazoncomthis has to be the most unresponsive guitar controller for guitar hero
the first time i played gh with this guitar i immediately switched to the analog controller one of the few ps gh games that i could use analog controller on because this controller simply did not work
i was also disappointed that it had such a poor battery life so i always had to keep changing the batteries
this guitar was included when i bought the gh iii and les paul guitar bundle
amazingly the quality of the game is completely the opposite of the guitars quality
i highly recommend gh iii but if you want to get the most out of gh iii you should save your money and buy the world tour guitari enjoyed this game to a point
i could not get past that stupid monster you are supposed to light on fire just when you think you have him beat he spins and regains full strength
there are no life crystals near by for spyro to regain his strength
i might eventually beat this monster with a lot of luck and a miracle
thats only part of it i was told you have to beat him  times in a row
i am usually pretty good at games i defeated hp deathly hallows barely but i did that one is nonstop fighting
i dont know why they have made games seem impossible to beat
dont get me wrong i do not care for the easy games either that i can get through within an hour
i would like to actually enjoy the game
excellent job to those of you who beat this monster
i can not stand the thought of a game beating me so i will continue to try
i am giving this game  stars because it is extremely difficult which took the joy out of it for mepositives beautiful graphicsnegatives no minigames no playable characters bare minimum of collecting continous gameplay no going back or to alternate worlds
a d scroller essentially
limited firebreath new fighting combos limited magicif you thought that the last game a new beginning was too different from the spyro you know and love dont bother with this one
gameplay is so different that the only thing this game has in common with other spyro games is the charactersthere are no minigames no sidequests no interaction with other characters and the barest minimum of collecting
two relics and the occasional quill
if you miss these there is no way to go back
how is that possible
there is only one world only one way to explore and no map
the game itself is beautiful adorable cutscenes and a almost movielike quality
however the controls are completely different
you are required to defeat enemies using combos pressing different buttons in order instead of just running up and flaming them
flaming is a occasional option you have limited firebreath and must find chargable crystals to recharge
another new effect is dragon time
spyro can now make the game go into slomotion for a few secondswhich is why i say rip spyro this game is so desperate to evolve that it leaves out everything that made it such a popular series in the first placein previous spyro games my daughter has laughed and giggled at the silly creatures collected goodies and had footraces with a little thief who makes silly nyaahnyaah noises the whole waysierra has taken this franchise and turned it into a littleboy game
only trouble is any child who has played these games is going to be disappointed at the nonstop monotonous murderunless youre training your child to be addicted to destroying an endless chain of monsters dont bother
the cute factor is gone
my daughter used to love running through other levels againthats gone too
now you plow straight from beginning to end like a purple beowulf stuck to your quest until the bitter endi didnt know much about this game going in but id heard good things about it and decided to pick it up because best buy was practically giving it away
as of this writing  theyre selling it in stores for half the price that amazon has it listedi will say this about the game it has a pretty extensive level editor where you can design everything from the ships to the bullets to the enemies and everything in between
not only can you design your own levels but you can also trade with people or download from othersthe problem is thats about the only thing this game has going for it because the gameply is pretty subpar
the horizontal shooting genre has been done to death and the ability to collect fallen enemies and add them to your ship is a novelty that wears off pretty quickly
but hey dont take my word for it do a search for this game on youtube and see if the videos do anything for youmy recommendation if you like the idea of building your own stuff youre probably going to get a lot of mileage out of it
otherwise i wouldnt pay more than  dollars for this
as for me i am a casual gamer who doesnt play a lot so even if i didnt have games on the shelf i havent finished yet that are a lot more fun than this it is doubtful i would take the time required in the editor to actually build something interestingive played spyro games since way back and while i liked the old format better i am actually okay with the new legend spyro however this game is with out a doubt the worst of the  legends and one of the worst spyro games around
it seems like once you got half way through the game it was all boss fights
through out most of the boss fights your stuck in one position have one attack and have limited space to move around in
your attack strength improves a little bit but not much you health doesnt improve at all
it seems like it only takes a weak enemy  hits to kill you the boss fights are a little more forgiving with your health but the rest of the game your health is a major problem
the whole game is unfair you often face against dozens of enemies at once with some of the enemies they dont have to wait a second to keep attacking they can just beat you to death
a good example of this would be the fellmuth arena you have  very strong boss like enemies attacking you at once you have to do a certain attack to even get to the point where you can do any damage that is if you can even do your attack
the whole game seemed unfair and no fun
i wouldnt buy this game unless it was like  bucks
save your money and get a better spyro game if your trying to follow the whole legend story just watch this games cut scenes on youtube and save your self the troubleby todays standard i think i got it for a buck but just get one of the newer games they are much much better and well worth the price difference gave  stars because the price and it was maybe ok when it first released i can give a more detailed review because the game didnt hold me in didnt a few round  minutes and im done with itthe game does not work properly
it keeps asking for me to register every time i play it
that said the game is a decent pinball experience and does not require highend hardware
the responsiveness of controls is not bad
it could use more exciting levels and for that matter some level choices but overall it was worth the  or so i spent on itglad i bought this game used as it was an extreme disappointment
the game is too difficult for my yo to figure out and my yo thinks its too boring
the game play was really touchy and not very forgiving for an unsteady yo hand when using the wii remote
i recommend the doradiego series instead for age group i purchased this for christmas since my  year old daughter loves barbie island princess
the video preview made it look attractive and age appropriate but the game is such a let down
the game play is very slow you are always waiting for the next screen or game to load and the games are too basic
the constant pauses for loading makes the experience very boring and my kids got tired of this very quickly
worst game ive experienced on the wii by far
i definitely dont recommend buying thisi really enjoy this type of game
the military strategy type games seem to have eaten up most of my time on my ds
advance wars and front mission are two of my most oft played games
so it was with considerable excitement that i loaded up panzer tacticsmilitary strategy
checkauthentic hardware
checkhistorical accuracy
checkeverything i love about video games seemed to be contained within this plastic cartridge
the graphics are great the music is listenable and the story line is engaging
one of the most exciting aspects of this game to me was the ability to play as not just as the americans or the germans but you can play as the soviets as well
so with much excitement brewing i wrapped myself in this game on a slow tuesday night
i was tired nothing was on tv and i had nothing much to do and  hours could be spent brewing up military strategies
i was fairly happy with this game for about  minutes when i realized that i was still on the first mission and hadnt accomplished much
this game is so slow moving
your units dont move far at all per turn and some of the objectives are many many squares away
another aspect that infuriated me was some of the inattention to details
for example in the first mission i played as the nazis attempting to take warsaw poland
one of the first battles i had was my nazi airforce of mes against some polish biplanes
the first battle it was  planes vs  planes
on the first swoop my topofthe line fighters took out  rickety old biplanes and the ww  era polish airforce took out  of my fighters
i had a second set of  fighters lined up to go in for the final kill so this time it would be  vs   i like these odds
with the second attack i downed  biplanes and the poles for  of mine
impossible
with this i switched of the game probably to never play again
thanks but no thanks
while the vehicles maps and situations may be true the impossible situations that the cpu was able to pull out of time and time again just seemed  cheap
dont purchase this unless you have hours upon hours to kill the patience of a swiss watch maker and like ridiculously impossible odds against you no matter the situation
i think ill stick with advance warsi bought this set for my own ds and it is terrible
i am not impressed
dont waste your money on this particular set
buy something else
the pink plastic is cheap and flimsy as well as all of the accessories
the best part about it if there is a best part is the drawstring bag to hold all of the items
the zipper ds holder is alright too but i ended up buying a nice nerf brand cover that has their typical thick pad and remains securely on the ds to protect it from fallswith godzilla popularity hitting a new high it was a blessing that atari took up the flag for godzillabased games
starting with the first game destroy all monsters melee atari started what will hopefully be a longrunning series of harcore fighting games
they actually got the formula right albeit with a few flaws
sadly those who are familiar with godzilla save the earth will not find anything new herelittle more than an upgrade to save the earth godzilla unleashed is the next entry into the series
unlike its wii counterpart the ps version falls short in virtually all areas
with only  not quitenew additions to the roster grainy graphics and faulty sound coupled with tremendous gameplay slowdown gu is borderline unplayable
though it could be argued that the ps is showing its age the fact that gu looks and plays the way it does is no less the fault of the developers than the dated system they created the game forif theres one glaring problem gu faces it would have to be the fact that it has virtually nothing to set it apart from save the earth
godzilla fans everywhere were elated to find that save the earths already robust roster would be bolstered by fan favorites like biollante and firsttime appearences by king cesar and titanosaurus but were then disappointed to learn that none of the new additions would be featured in the ps edition
instead ps fans were treated to exclusive monster battra who is nothing more than a mothra clone with oddly enough rodans recycled noises and roars
the only difference between mothra and battra is that like the godzilla  mothra battle for earth film battra features an energy beam in his larva form instead of an immobilizing silk
in addition to battra ps players will get obsidius one of the two original monsters created by the developers
obsidius is simply a clone of orga with a different beam weaponthe arenas are somewhat creativeyoull find many of the same landscapes that were in save the earth except this time they are devastated by the effects if crystal meteors that have crashed into earth
otherwise the arenas work the same as they did in the previous  games buildings will sink into the ground after some soid hits and smaller buildings can be hurled at opponents
the force fields are still in place albeit much harder to see which results in many accidental collisions with them
other hazards on some levels include crystal towers that shoot laser beams lava and poisonous gas vents
though the levels look good in scope there is so much going on at any given time that the game goes into tremendous slowdownespecially if more than two monsters are fightingwhich brings us to gameplay the games most disappointing aspect
the new story mode is so convoluted and bizarre that youll win missions without realizing why
the games faction system is a bit bizarre as wellearth defenders gdf aliens and mutants are all on seperate factions with roughly    monsters in each faction more on the wii
gdf contains the mecha units earth defenders contain godzilla and the good monsters whereas mutants contain monsters such as megaguirus and aliens are obviously the same cast as usual with fan favorite king ghidorah and his pals
you gain and lose faction for bizarre and mostly unintentional reasons often resulting in aliances you dont want
and regardless of faction alliances you will usually be thrown into battle with your allies for one reason or anotherthe combat system is so flawed that you wont even be able to get the least amount of enjoyment out of it
even the brawl mode battles descend into frustration and boredom
your ai opponents do nothing but crouch and block and retaliate in the middle of your combo something players cannot do to ai opponents with a devastating hit
as with the previous games ai opponents typically do much more damage than you especially with beam attacks
button response time is sluggish often resulting in your attack being delayed
ai opponents tend to have esp and predict every attack you will launch so you rarely get a clean hit inthe physics system is flawed with environmental damage behaving rather erratically
one of the biggest let downs is that you can no longer throw your opponents
for some bizarre reason any throw attack you attempt simply results in your monster placing the opponent on the ground
this means that the satisfying midair collision finishes you were able to perform in previous games can no longer be performed
i have only seen two monsters that could throw opponents at any length and they were mechagodzillla  and obsidius one of godzillas throw attacks sometimes produces a ranged toss
hopefully this is corrected in the wii version or i pray the eventual xbox  versionone of the better aspects of the game is that there are no more powerups dropped from roaming ufos
this completely eliminates the mad dash for powerups that often results when one of them is dropped
i often dubbed save the earth as godzilla the race for powerups simply because the ai always made a mad dash for it
instead powerup crystals sometimes rise from the ground and the ai usually ignores them unless they are within a few feet
gone are the rage modes now replaced by crystal overloads represented by a red glow on ps but a much cooler glowing vein look in wii similar to meltdown godzilla from godzilla vs destoroyah
this overload results in tremendous speed and power upgrades albeit temporary
you also take much more damage in this mode
in addition to this you can acquire activated power surges in the story mode that give different effects acquired by defeating monsters currently affected by a surgethe story is conveyed through poorly animated cut scenes with terrible english voice overs japanese is optional and subtitles that are so slow that the dialogue will have advanced by  scenes before it changes to the next line
there are no real endings eitherbeating the game with the alien faction results in the gdf proclaiming the vortaak win
followed by a cheesy ahhahahahaha
from the vortaak queenoverall the game just feels halfhearted
almost the same roster tremendous slowdown unbalanced gameplay and faulty controls make for a muddy sluggish experience
if you are holding out for a wii then wait until you pick it up so that you may acquire the superior wii version
however if history repeats itself we may see an xbox  version in    months that blows both versions out of the water with even more monsters arenas and features just like what happened with the first gamebreakdownpros fun kaiju action no matter how you look at it no more powerup drops eliminates the dash for powerups war interesting faction system conceptcons sluggish gameplay tremendous slowdown virtually no difference in roster from save the earth ai crouches and blocks so much you could rename all the monsters to gamera get it
turtling
 bad collision detection unable to throw opponents many characterspecific super moves are missing kiryus freezer beam laughable story mode and poor timing with subtitlesif you have save the earth avoid unleashedtheres no point to it
hold out for the wii version or hopefully a  version that will contain even more featuresvery disapponted
same as godzilla save the earth but lacking the things that were fun with the old game
there are no mingames no new monsters unless they are locked and i just cant see them but they king caeser and biolante are not mentioned in the booklet
cut scenes are comic book like still photos and voice over is hardly audible
my son who is six loves the old game
this one has made him cry many timesive been looking for a simple joystick for fsx
it seemed the logitech joysticks suffered from reliability issues so i decided to try this joystick because of the good reviews
when i received the joystick everything seemed great except for the throttle
i actually liked the position of the throttle on this model which was one of the main reasons i decided to go with it
however i was surprised to find that it seemed hard to move
it seems you can put your thumb in it but to move it requires a certain amount of force to get it moving that when it finally does it jumps
also theres a stop zone in between the silver and red marks which is another thing that makes it more difficult to control
i was expecting a smooth motion like i had with my wingman  i was replacing
the throttle on the wingman feels very fluid and is easy to move so you can easily control the position
i thought i had a defect so i called thrustmaster and they said to return it to amazon
i received my replacement and sure enough the throttle is the same
not only that but this one made an annoying popclick whenever the joystick returned to center from the left half
i ended up returning it and ill be going with another joystickfrom the previous chapter of fire emblem this has taken a turn for the worstthe storyline was way toodivided between  main characters instead of one
on top of that there seems to have been a drastic change in some of the characters relationships as well as just the overall theme and tone of the storyit would be okay to me if they just introduced new characters to addon to the previous installment of fire emblem path of radiance but for some odd reason that didnt happenthis game is harder than the path of radiance however they changed too much of the games mechanics in this one to the point where veterans would have to learn a whole new game  and thats not very fun
in addition the supposedly transition of the datafile from fire emblem path of radiance was negligible
basically your heroes stats would only be affects if they were a maxed level unit
a level  promoted unitthey attempted to balance the weapons triangle so fiercely that i believe they took away the uniqueness of what each class is intended for
for example they would allow ranged weapons for every class now swordsmen axewielders and lancers that there just seems to be an overlap against mages and archers
they made it so that everyclass was basically a genericblandof course im making a biased review because i didnt like the endingreplay value 
after you beat the game you will be given the option to start a new game plus
although you may be able to make some slight differences of the outcomes ultimately the ending is the same
it kind of defeats the purpose of replaying the gameit is nonstop  star reviews for this game but for me there was just not enough customization or replayabilitypersonally i love srpgs advanced wars dynasty tactics xcom played them all
recently a batch of great srpg games came out jeanne darc ff tactics disgaea on the psp all  had its specialtyfire emblem  dont see what all the hype and rave reviews are about
after just  week ive already put this down to play disgaea its far more funcharacters  too many so many that you do not feel attached to them and many of them are unbalanced
which means some are crucial to the gameplay some its better to just leave them or let them diecustomization  there is none each character has specific powers
you select a weapon but there is nothing else you can customize no armor nothing
yes there is the relationship build up and skill but its stil lackingstory itself  this is not bad its worth taking the time to read thru the text
though by this generation systems you expect a little more graphical power or design flair its a tad bit boring presentationhow to generate funds  bonus items   its done thru fixed talks with npcs
theres no point to read thru those text just click  and skip to the end and receive the funds or item
imho this is done poorlygameplay  some characters are absolutely critital if you want to advance thru the harder levels
its easy to get killed and i think most of us would like to keep all charactere alive
to do so you will need to reload the game a lot
heres the problem there is no load game option you have to quit to wii menu and start over
this alone makes the whole process painfuloverall  if this game came out at the beginning of the year where there was absolutly no srpg games then it would be a solid  star
just in these few month you get  awesome tactics games  jeanne darc ff tactics disgaea fire emblem just doesnt hold its own
if you dont have a psp and love srpgs then fire emblem is the definitely a good choice and only choice
for sure ill play it later when the srpg games dry up but for now disgaea is a far more funi played this game before its prequel path of radiance for the gamecubein the beginning the story and characters seemed uninspiring the dialogue wooden and juvenile
how could anyone care for the dawn brigade
leonardo edward nolan so shockingly poor characters do i seldom see
also the whole presentation seemed flawed
outdated graphics unmemorable music bad voiceacting still pictures and lifeless imageslittle by little i grew into the game and after a while i was no longer bothered by the things which i mentioned
the story characters and dialogue all improved as the game moved on particularily in part iiia new to the series the game felt immensely difficult at times but it was mostly for not thinking ahead and trying to move too fast
on second playthrough even hardmaniac mode is a piece of cakehowever only after playing path of radiance and then starting this game again do i see how lackluster this game actually is
a pity they coulndt build better on the foundation laid by the prequelbetween super mario kart and the lego games for the ds this one was played once for maybe  minutes
it might be fun but my kids couldnt get past the board game part of the gameim not impressed with this racing game
its impossible to get around in the options of the program as it does not display a cursor so you have to move the mouse around blindly to try to find your intended selection
then it does not recognize the microsoft xbox  wireless controllers
all this makes for a game play that cant be set up to the users preference so the actual racing suffers
im completely put out by this game
i do not recommend itsimple game great for kids or for a relaxing word game
good wordsearch and anagrams but not much of a challengeso i thought the whole idea of this game was great until i played it
its not fun when you sit staring blankly at your ds screen for over ten minutes thinking of the answer to a problemnot far into the game i spent over a half hour with a paper and pencil figuring out mathematicsjust not funi understand and see how a puzzle game can be fun but i dont want to have to whip out a calculator protractor computer paper pencil erasers text books etc just to play this gamepuzzles were just way too easy or very hard
the early puzzles nearly all relied in trick wording
then later puzzles have wording that was imprecise making the trick wording answer wrong
really could have used a detailoriented editor
a few good wood block sliding puzzles and some good drawing puzzles
the worded puzzles were mostly just sameoldrerun boring youd get by searching the internet using the keyword brainteaser
had to keep putting it away for a week in order to stand to finish
worst part was doors and puzzles just appear in old places after being triggered by something
so you had to keep going back and clicking on everything in the scenes over and over again
video scenes and dialogue were ok but no substitute for substance
certainly no replay value
big disappointmenti can see why so many people are raving about this game
the graphics are gorgeous and if you are partial to brain games its a good choicehowever if you hate brain games like me the storyline and graphics will not save this game for you
i thought perhaps a story might make me enjoy the brain games but noalso professor layton and the kid give me the creeps and i dont think theyre supposed toi sold my copy after three daysim generally not a fan of pc style adventure games which this basically is
with all the great reviews though i figured id give this a shot when i saw it on salei actually got a lot more enjoyment out of it than i was expecting
the art style is generally charming
the story what i got of it is fairly interestingthe puzzles range from very easy to absurdly hard though theres a general progression of easier to harder puzzles as the game progresses
i found many of the puzzles fun some annoying but solvable and a decent chunk either no fun at all or impossible for me to figure outthe way the game is structured one usually has the ability to skip puzzles that one is stuck onbut unfortunately not always
i had to give up finally on a puzzle somewhere past the halfway markon a very nitpicky technical note i did find the load time between screens a bit annoying as i progressed
its only a couple of seconds but it adds upbottom lineif youre a fan of point and click adventures or puzzles youll probably enjoy it
if not odds are youll still have some fun with it but youd probably be better served buying something else or buying it on salevery fun game when i can play longer than  minutes without crashingsee belowas soon as the game loaded a very large patch is required now i think their is an additional patch which i also downloaded
it is very large and takes time even with highspeed cable
once i had everything installed and patched my problems started
i had been playing company of heroes and had not had any problems in single player and online multiplayeri had purchased a dell xps  with dual sli nvidia  last december and it ran great playing coh however my system would crash to desktop constantly playing cohof
i downloaded all the patches and the problem persisted
i came across a hardware problem on my xps and dell sent me out a new xps two weeks agoit came with with the ati crossfire xxt
again i loaded both coh and cohofmy new system still crashes but now i lose my gameplay and cannot pull up the game from the desktop which forces me to reload the entire game and pull up the save games if i remembered to saveif not im starting over again
this mornings after trying for two weeks to enjoy the game but having to start over time after time i uninstalled cohof and reinstalled coh and loaded all the patches to v
i have not had one crash to desktop and am playing on highest resolution of x
the coh game runs great not one single issueall my problems started when i loaded the opposing fronts and associated patches
i would have thought it might have been the ati card but i was having the same problem with both ati and nvidia cards
so this leads me to think its the coh opposing fronts especially since my reload of coh has not had a crash and imo its the game and not my systemi will wait and see if other patches are available in the comming months before i try and reinstall cohof as i really enjoy the online gameplay
oh my system has an intell quad core gig ram dual crossfire xxt so is a very capable machine to run coh and cohofabout the game its great and i really enjoy the panzer elite and british factions added to the gameplay
i was able to finish both campaigns through constant saving and even managed an online v game
the two campaigns are very fun and some are very tough
i really enjoyed the skirmish mode and being able to fight with a combination of american british panzer elite and wermacht and it makes for some great gameplayi do expect relic to add additional factions like they did in warhamer  which has  factions so maybe they will add the russians and italians sometime in the future
overall its a great game so take a chance and try the game maybe you will not have the crashing problems some of us have experienced
im sure relic is on top of this and will come out with a patch to help fix the problems out of  skirmish crashes buggynot as good as the original company of heroesi wish i could tell you just how much i loved playing diablo
the gameplay was fresh addictive and entertaining while the setting was made even more enthralling by the graphics which were at the time gorgeous
it was simple it was easy and it was very accessible
i wasnt as much of a fan of diablo ii but at least that was fun to play at lan partieshellgate london is the worst of the series without the best
the click happy gameplay hasnt much changed but the setting is not nearly as interesting and the graphics are incredibly dull
now dull graphics would be ok except there are times when it still reduces my system to a drooling moron at parts
the dialog is fairly well written but its lacking the sort of voice acting that made the lore and story of diablo so interesting to learn about
at the very least they could have recorded dialog for the main characters but instead all they have are npc greetings which after hearing for the th time in one night youll wish had not been included in the gameall of this would be acceptable were it not for the lame skill trees random level generator that seems anything but weak story and nothing but recycled quest goals
on top of that they no longer allow lan only multiplay
if you love playing slot machines get this game
otherwise save yourself the rsi and get a game thatll be addictive and funnoticed quite a few reviews giving one star for drm most of which havent even played the game
i found these to be mostly pointless so ive decided to write a review on my experiences with this game for those looking for an actual review of the game itself not a rant on the drmyes this has ubisofts new drm program and aside from some minor stuttering here and there game play experience was for the most part smooth
however my gripe with this game isnt how it performs but the game itself
this isnt splinter cell its a mix between bourne and bond
i felt that stealth was for the most part completely disregarded in favor of action and while this isnt a bad thing this game does not pull it off well
unlike the previous games there is no penalty for killing anyone in this game and for the most the game even encourages players to kill
and the action in this game leaves quite a bit to be desired there arent many weapons in the game and the enemy ai is rather stupid
the decision to remove the ability to pick up and hide dead bodies is a bad one considering that one a body is spotted everyone in the level is on alert
in the previous games clever mechanics gave you a way to sneak around an enemy unseen like whistling and running past their side when they turn around to investigate this game lacks that if someone is in your way your only available method is to kill them
i would also like to mention a strange glitch i encountered on some occasion
for some reason after i pull out the handgun it would just automatically keep firing until i hit the fire key myself
this has gotten me killed several times where it alerts everyone to my position
the game is also ridiculously short first run through took me roughly  hours but the second took about  there are more faults that are too numerous list and i am too lazy to
lets just say that this game has more than its fair share of problemsthe graphics in this game are pretty good nothing outstanding but good nonetheless
i like how everything turns black and white when youre completely hidden sort of gives it a cool noir feeling
the interrogation scenes were cool at first but the charm quickly wore offi dont know what happened that caused this game to turn out the way it did some rumors stated its because the team had a new creative director who isnt a big stealth fan
whatever the reason this game tried to be both action and stealth and failed at both
if i wanted action i wouldve played modern warfare
i wanted stealth and didnt get it
oh well life is full of disappointments i suppose
ive already preordered my copy of alpha protocol that comes out next week hopefully that game delivers on the stealththis game lags whenever played even on the lowest graphic settings
people have been saying the ubisoft designed it for a gaming console the fitted for the pc which is why it lags on some computers
this game has been known to lag even on extremely powerful pcsas far as the gameplay goes it is not the same as the other splinter cell games
this game is a little more action packed and sam isnt even an agent anymore
i hate the way the controls are set up it makes it a little hard to play after playing the other gamesi would not recommend this gamei bought mine from harleys international shipped from uk and arrived in perfect condition factory sealedi thought there might be more to this than previous sim city games
ultimately it is more of the same make your own fun experience
i wanted to like it more but i guess i need more than a sandbox of tools to make a city to have funi wish i would have waited until now to buy sim city societies
 would be a better price for the amount of fun it offers
i bought it at the full retail price a year ago had a good time with it for a couple of days but i havent really played it since
i liked the aspects of the different types of cities but once i accomplished it i became bored
perhaps i would have had enjoyed it longer if more of the aspects of sim city had been left in
id been frustrated by some of the difficulties id encountered in sim city  staying profitable but sim city societies was too easy dumbed down way too much
its a shame they didnt better incorporate aspects of boththis is what happens with a merger that is never given the chance to consolidate no one gets what he expectsfirst of all if you were expecting either simcity  or the sims  or even the long lost simville this is not where to look scsocieties was developed not by maxis but by tilted mill of caesar  fame  but this in itself is neither good or bad
definetely bad is where they decided to take both franchises thoughgone are most of the gameplay options that made the simcity series a citymanagement gem
the good old colored city zones are no more  instead you have to micromanage every single building
in place of the zones there are now six nebulous social energies productivity prosperity authority creativity spirituality and knowledge
every building either produces or consumes one or more of these energies
for example a library creates knowledge but consumescreativity
yeah i know to add insult to injury these social energies do not always make real world sense either
its more of a trial  error learning processthe functioning of a real city is not observed in many aspects for example utilities need not be connected to your buildings if enough powerplants within the city limits you are fine
i guess teslas theories of wireless energy transfer finally found their mainstream nicheeven more absurdly civic improvements ornaments and decorations have a cumulative beneficial effect on all the city  not just on adjacent areas
this makes as much sense as say raising the property values of all apartments in a city with a central park somewherehere is why fans of the sims will be left disappointed as wellsure your sims still have infoballoons depicting moods and needs but you can have no direct effect on them
you end up playing thebuildings not them
so if you though it would be fun to see your beloved sims interact on a larger scalenot yetgraphically scsocieties is a true eye candy
the buildings and city improvements are well and clearly designed and they are abundant  over  distinct items
 lighting and shadows are not only impressive but realistic in perspective and scale as well and the weather effects not to mention the impressive natural disasters
add another level of visual appealnow try placing a beautifully designed and perfectly shadowcasting building that can rotate only in degrees increments onto rightangled street blocks
it took me over  minute to place a single separating wall between two houses at maximum magnification mind you
you see beauty can only be a means to an end when it comes to game designfor such a shallow game scsocieties does convey an illusion of depth
there are statistics everywhere  almost every object sports various infoballoons with them
for the casual gamer who obviously this game is aimed at this all looks very impressive
i very much doubt that more experienced gamers will enjoy this ride thoughtake you pick based on your experience levelthe good good model damaging deep customization varied event types decent graphicsthe bad annoying announcer monotonous races unbalanced throughout online play is shut down slow to earn cashneed for speed has taken many different directions but the mid to late s were the worst for the series
prostreet is probably the worst nfs i have played and i cant really recommend this to even hardcore fans
the game has good customization options and varied event types but after a couple dozen races you will be boredraces consist of earning a certain amount of points to dominate the day
these events range from drifts drags grip time attack and sector shootout
sector shootout is where you have a track divided into sections and you must get the fastest times in those to win
grip races are straight up races and the rest is history
out of these events the drags are the best because you need to heat up your tires before racing
you can only win by getting perfect shifts but after you get nos upgrades the drags become really easy
there are  mile and  mile drags but i would have liked to see  and  mile drags as well
all the other races are pretty boring and drifting in the game feels like dragging an  wheeler through dirt
no matter what car you use drifting never feels right and is a huge pain to pull offthe game was one of the first nfs games that used realtime damage which is supposed to affect the way the car drives but really doesnt
you can get light and heavy damage but i never really noticed much of a hit in performance
if you damage your car you have to repair before the next race but you can use cash or repair markers that you earn
my biggest issue with these race days is that if you quit in the middle you have to restart the whole thing
this drove me nuts because i couldnt go upgrade my car and come backupgrading your cars is pretty fun because there are a lot of options for both performance and cosmetic
you can fine tune your car as well but there is a quick upgrade option for impatient people
you can only have certain cars for certain event types but you can only save customizations as blueprints
this allows you to have multiple looks and loadouts for your cars
i found that cash is given very slowly and parts are very expensive so you wont be upgrading very often which is a huge bummerlastly the game is just monotonous
after about a couple dozen races you will feel fed up with the same tired races over and over again
the physics feel too weighty and most cars feel the same no matter how you upgrade them
the whole game is really unbalanced and poorly designed
the game doesnt even officially support the game for windows controller and just show keyboard buttons instead
i just gave up about half way through because some races were always easy no matter who you did and some extremely difficult no matter how good you were
the visuals are decent but not anything to write home about
the announcer is just extremely annoying to listen to with his stoner oneliners and he just blabbers on about nonsenseoverall prostreet wasnt very good when it came out and isnt  years later
there were and still are better racing games out there
i cant really recommend this game unless you like monotony and repetitive nonsense
prostreet is halfbroken and highly unbalanced
as it stands this is probably the worst nfs out there right nowi did not like this expansion pack because it wasnt like aoe in the sense where you could customize your city and overall i found this to be a small expansion
it is still fun to play just not what i expectedwekll this appears to be another microsoft bo bolittle here that is not on primary disksmore aircraft but still very elementarysurely this company can come up with more challenge  more life like animationi have been a staunch fan of all flight simulator productions
but i surely will want to see the next version in action before i buythis seemd to be a great gameloading finethen could not bring up the game
i had to go through somediaxexe phasewhich in my years of playing videos and building computers i dont mess with it
i took it backdont mess with iti just bought this game recently and put several hours into it before deciding that it was not enough fun to continue playingthe good graphicsvisuals this is really the strength of tools of destruction
even at p this game looks very impressive
no its not like an interactive pixar movie but you could see why people might compare this to playing in a dreamworks animation movie
this game is just full of bright colored smoothly animated objectsenvironmentscharacters that it is really fun to just watch
the cut scenes are well made as well and give a cinematic feel to the game
there are a lot of moving objects in the background especially in the cities that give a vibrant and more realistic feel to the environments
breaking boxescontainers is especially fun to watch and hear soundmusic the sound as well is excellent
great game music and sound effects that can really be appreciated if you have a decent  speaker system
the sound of breakingdestroying objectscontainers is great and the effects when you pick up various objectsbonuses considerably add to the fun of this gameunfortunately thats where the good endsthe mediocre storyacting comparing this game to a generic animated film like ice age or happy feet would be understandble but to compare this game to a pixar movie is just ridiculous
you will not find pixar quality writing in this game
the characters are not interestingly designed and the writing is not very humorous or clever
kind of like any nonpixar animation studio movie which is not to say that it is horrible just mediocre as one would expect from a video game of this typethe not so good gameplay true i did not finish the game and only played through the first few levels before i packed it up and sold it on the most popular auction site
however the gameplay left me rather bored after awhile
initially it was fun running around hitting or shooting enemies picking up objects jumping up walls and sliding on railstracks which thankfully are not accompanied by visual cues of which buttons to press while sliding as in uncharted and heavenly sword
but after awhile it became extremely tedious and boring
from the beginning this game plays as an arcade game with nonstop hack and slash action
not until you pass a couple of levels is there even a spot where you are not constantly fighting
the fighting also gets tiresome quickly
you can slash with your melee weapon or shoot a variety of gunsprojectilesetc
but youll find that it is far too easy to just use the same attack slash attack when midair for a huge circumferential attack to kill all enemies in the first few stages
linearity this is a gameplay issue as well but deserves its own section because it is so extremely linear that it significantly and negatively affects gameplay
this game basically is runningjumpinggliding from point a to point b and so on
you do not get a sense that this is a real world but rather just a series of hiking trails in a variety of environments
this makes it easy to navigate yet extremely boring
between the linear stages are cut scenes that while nice give you the feeling that you are watching an interactive movie where you can control the characters but that ultimately everything is following a prewritten script
there is zero free exploration in this game essentially it is as openended a world as you would find in a classic s sidescrolling game
lack of anything to do but hack n slash also a gameplay issue but there is nothing to do in this game but continuously hack n slash
no exploration no real puzzle solving at least in the first few levels no figuring out what to do next
just following the prescripted levels one tedious level after the nextthe bottom linebasically this game has great presentation and production values but the gameplay just flat out sucks
so boring unless you are the type of gamer who enjoys linear gameplay with mindless hacking and slashing
i would not recommend this game to anyone i know except as a demo to demonstrate the visualaudio capabilities of the psoverall rating is a  stars because the excellent presentation does not compensate for the extreme linearity and tedious nature of this game which in the end should be fun not just fun to look at and listen toit is repetitive and dull
every level is pretty much the exact same but maybe you will have a different gun which makes absolutely no differencei guess you could call the graphics good but that doesnt make the game any betterit gets the job done however its very cheaply made and broke fast
clap
clapget an official controller
stay away from this garbageits no surprise that it comes all curled up since they ship it in a tube
the problem is that i never could get it to lie flat
the edges always curled up
after a month or so of use the logo that was printed on the cloth wore off
a little more and one of the edges started to separate the cloth from the rubberit also was hard to get it to stay put because its too thin and too light
my hand on my mouse was enough to make the whole mouse pad move which sucks when youre trying to get precision movement in an online game
like others have said its not worth the time and trouble to ship it back for a replacement
i wound up actually going back to a mousepad from i wouldnt buy anothernot a good game at all
no educational value for kids
the game is based on luck
no strategy is required only luckby now the buzz games are sort of well known as the goto trivia experience for owners of playstation systems
this one is targeted towards younger gamers and is less about trivia and more about a mario party minigames type experience with buzz controllersfor a later generation playstation  game the graphics are not bad at all albeit a bit dated
the soundtrack is full of cheesy music and annoying sound effects not super surprising considering the audience theyre catering or talking down
tothe game itself is fairly mediocre
the various activities a hot potato variation etc are fairly routine and slightly dull
i played this three younger kids the oldest one being  and everyone got fairly restless and as far as i could tell bored  minutes in
i suspect this has a pretty short shelf lifethere are better games out there both for trivia and minigames
pick up one of the maligned mario party games if you own a nintendo console from the last  years and you andor your kids most likely will have a much better timelittle kids will probably like this  look at the sets of toys they like and its pretty obvious that they arent really the most bias category on the block
it is easy it has games they can play and it comes with buzzers that allow up to four players to hop in an begin mashing buttons
it is also easy  the target for the game seems to say that right away  and there are hours to be had for someone too little to kick it into the big game range
as far as the rest of the family   ive always hated the fun for the whole family tag because it means this is a title that little kids enjoy big kids dont really love older kids find distasteful and adults just wonder about
we have headsets that we can wear multiplayer games that support armadas of players and this comes on the heels of a faltering system
so it really isnt the connectivity prize it claims when it says it is for all age rangesfor adultsgood for adult parties  you cant handle complex things like driving or operating a glass so you might like thisgood when you suffer from insomnia  sleepless enough makes you appreciate almost anythinggood for when you want an electronic babysitter just let the little ones have friends overto recap it works for the age range but  and up is not really accurateive played many star wars games over the years
my favorite game is jedi academy
so i was thrilled when lucas arts was making a game that was going to be on the playstation  originally jedi academy was going to be on the pc mac xbox and ps but they skipped the ps believing the system didnt have the capabilities
so only the xbox mac and pc got the game
so could this be the game i was hoping for
yes and no
first the graphics are very good when playing through the levels
but the cut scenes are plain and devoid of emotionsthe gameplay is hit and miss
while the controls are great and easy to pick up even on easy mode it can be a real challenge
it takes several hits to take down a single enemy
some take two hits while others take more than five
the boss battles are easy in the beginning but later on can be frustrating
all major boss battles are in a timed button fight
another words when you fight the boss button symbols will appear on screen asking you to quickly press or press repeatedly the buttons until the sequence is done
if you mess up just once you have to start all over again
which made me very angry and tiresome
your thumbs or fingers will be worn out
your ps buttons will eventually be worn out as well if your not careful
in jedi academy all you had to do was swing the lightsaber on your opponent or shoot your guns until the enemy was defeatedthere is only a single player campaign
no multiplayer option
the game is very linear meaning you cant take alternate paths to reach your goal
you follow the map and it directs you to the locationsthe story is very good
very well written
the voice acting is excellent
but the game feels like they could have done morethe sound as always is excellent
the star wars music enhances the gamethere are plenty of extras to play around with
but its missing the stage select option
once you done it will ask you to start all over again with all your powers
i dont understand why didnt they add a stage select
but the game was not done directly by lucasarts
it was done by krome studios
good effort
the ps got exclusive levels not scene in the other versionsforce unleashed was one of the last playstation  games to be made
its nice to see some companies willing to make ps games rather than skipping iti just wish the game wasnt a button masher when it came to the boss battles
i hate timed sequence action scenes
it takes fun out of the gaming experience
also it would have been nice to add a stage select screen so you can select which stage to play rather than going through the whole game over and over again
get this game cheap
dont pay for full pricei was going to buy a cheaper nicer looking offering from saitko but i was talked into the g by my friends thanks guys
they all have the older bluelit one and apparently it is superior to this new orangelit one and prettier to look at in the darknormally logitech makes a fantastic product so im surprised these are such junk
like many others ive had the key im pressing just stop registering
a few times it has stuck and my character wont stop running around or jumping or filling the screens with the letter s over and overin addition the keys just dont register very well and their design is really poor
some are really sensitive but others arent
some depress easily and some dont
and still others are squishy and stick
unfortunately that is the case with my spacebar of all dang keys
you know how often you use the spacebar
my typing speed has plummeted because i have to press the spacebar key sometimes  or more times before it registers because it hasnt lifted back up since the last time i used it  and when i do press on it it takes a lot of pressure to get it to go down
it feels like air is getting under it
weird ive never had a keyboard act like this onein the end im not really impressed
you get a cool looking keyboard and lit keys but you pay out the nose for it
and it doesnt work very well  so the people it is designed for serious computer folks are going to get tired of its behavior really fastoh almost forgot to mention
you only get a year warranty on this pile
even logitech knows it is a junk product
if you buy one hopefully youll get a good one that will last for youupdated graphics and motorcycles dont help the clunky physics of this game
accelerating is slow no matter what car youre in
motorcycles physics are a so touchy that you hit a wall no matter how light you touch the joystick
drifting is identical to what it was in pgr
which isnt good
you either break early or late and can never replicate from lap to lap making it near impossible to win a race
menu navigation is awkward
dropping out of a race early due to frustration from eating the wall and spinning out and dropping  places in the last lap gets you back to main menu however if you wanted to try that race again tough its not there
stay away from the pgr series
pgr has a long way to go before they hit the ranks of forza  and  need for speed most wanted grand turismoedit realized after writing this review that my tv had hz enabled
after disabling that it was easy to controlim just getting started in racing games and i found this one to be a bit difficult to control the vehicles
in forza i have no assistance handicaps enabled and i almost never crash in that game
in pgr i crash a lot and come in last more frequently than im accustomed to
maybe this game is supposed to be that difficult but even on easy mode i found the game to be more difficult than most new players would tolerate
guess this games going to collect dust while im busy having fun playing forza drift and burnoutside note do not buy the microsoft speed wheel if you plan on using it with this game
there arent any bumpers on it or joystick eithergraphics are ok i guess but my son played it once but he did not play it again so what can i sayi really wanted to like this game but besides from the occasional moment of pure racing bliss this game is immensely frustrating
first thing i noticed right away was that the turns are way too hard
you almost always are braking real fast just to make the turn and pick up speed
the turns are just so tight
another thing is the burnouts
it didnt matter what car i had or what i did it always seemed like i was burning out and it ruined races for me
you mess up once one time is all it takes and the race is over for youand thats all i found myself doing
the impossible handling with the turns and burnouts will ruin the experience for you
i soon felt pgr  was too much of an arcade racer so i picked up forza motorsport  and am much happier with that
i dont really have a lot of good to say about pgr except that it had its moments it just frustrated me because i was playing fine but the game didnt seem to let up with its problems
motorcycles were fun and the weather was kinda cool though not that big a deal
all i have to say is dont waste your money on this game like i did
there is much more fun to be had elsewherethis is a nice ideal but problem is the xbox  already comes with two usb ports
the usb ports can support your average usb keyboard that will do much the same function
id honestly save yourself some money and pick yourself up a cheap usb keyboard insteadnote that this is just the ms hdmi cable and not what is pictured
its an hdmi cable just like any other hdmi cable for example any  dollar one you can find on amazon
not worth the very high price in any waydoes what it should but not worth the money
if you have a newer  with the hdmi connection right below the audiovideo connection simply pry apart the plastic surrounding the audiovideo connector that came with your  and plug back in
take the  audio redwhite and hook to your receiver ignore the yellow
buy a simple and cheap hdmi cable from amazon and hook up to your hdtv
with the plastic gone both will now fit easily without needing this
total cost for me yesterday was an hdmi cable for about  which included shipping
works awesomethe  is a nice system if it works beyond  year
many people hv experienced problem with their xbox after  year when the warranty expires
the problem is commonly known as the  lights of death
i hv  units that hv had this issue
this is supposedly caused by mechanical failure
microsoft is blaming the problem on people plugging their  into a surge protector
somehow plugging it into a surge protector makes the  work harder for power
whether that is true ull be the judgei should have believed the bad reviews of this console
now im paying for it
i recently decided to purchase a  due to the fact that the other consoles didnt have games that i wanted
ps games i think their still working on it and wii if im  id might enjoy them
but  had crackdown dead rising bioshock etcso i finally got it and yes it is fairly easy to install and off i go
bought crackdown and it worked great
i was loving every minute of this gta rip off
i cant believe how fun it was
after three weeks i just could take it anymore
i had to know how that zombie filled mall was going to be
it was good wished i had more weapons
but something happenedthe game didnt worked right after a week
i looked at it and found scratches
just having bought the item i returned it and got another one
no scratches this time
i logged on and the infamous tech thing happened
the event that made so bittered from all you fanboys how preached about how great this console is
 freaking rings
are you kidding me
i didnt buy this at launch
why
why
is it to impossible for them to make their console work
i followed the rules
its on top of a well ventilated area not dust and never move it when its on
all that and nothing be three red rings a call and a box to mail it into
i hate fanboys and i hate this waiting
great i bought new games for a relatively new console and now im waiting like the launch victims werei bought this product for christams last year my kids had xbox before and we loved it so we decided to upgrade and i never knew that they have the overheating problem after my oldest son played overnight it never turned on again i had it for  months previous model we had for over  years and it never had any problemsmy kids love games that work with xbox but we decidet to change it to wiii had a hamster once
he cost about  and lived for not quite six months
i felt bad for the little guy but i also understood that short lives are the way of hamsters
short lives should not be the way of enormously expensive pieces of electronic equipmenti held off on getting an xbox  for a long time after launch because of the high number of hardware failures reported for the system especially after one of my friends had to return his xbox for service six times within a year
after microsoft announced that the new falcon chip set would virtually ensure a long service life for new s my girlfriend spent almost  to get me one as a birthday gift
it died yesterday after  months of intermittent use giving me the delightful three light red ring of death as it expired
granted microsoft has extended the warranty for the xbox  to  years for rrod issues and thus even as i type this a free shipping box is en route to me so my dead machine can take a trip to texas but widespread catastrophic hardware failures are ridiculous no matter how you slice it
the best part is that my own xbox wont be returned to me  instead ill get someone elses dead xbox that has also been returned and subsequently repaired
its even possible that instead of getting back a machine with the relatively robust falcon hardware i could get back a machine using one of the two previous and much less stable hardware configurations
to say that im concerned in an understatementwhen it works the xbox  is an excellent gaming system that features stunning graphics a large game library and a solid online experience though in all honesty id rather play with my friends in my own living room than with random strangers
as of  days ago id have easily rated the console a solid  stars not five  the need to sink another  on a wireless device to connect to the internet and the annoying high cost for peripherals and software counts against it
 but as of tonight i feel as if im being generous to rate it with   you should never have to qualify a statement about an extremely expensive piece of equipment with when it workseven worse is that microsoft hasnt been forthcoming with consumers about the cause of all these general hardware failures
theyre apparently caused by the system overheating but im not in any sense a hardcore gamer and i dont go on marathon gaming binges
my machine got maybe  hours of play per week and sat in a wellventilated area a framework style shelf that has neither sides nor a back in order to provide the console with maximum airflow
despite recommendations by some other users im unwilling to buy an external fan for two reasons 
i dont feel as if a consumer should have to spend extra money on a peripheral to ensure that a product will actually function as advertised and 
these external cooling fans have also been reported to damage the console and microsoft has announced that evidence of their use will resulting in a voiding of ones warrantyhonestly if youre willing to take a gamble on your console randomly biting the dust then the xbox  provides a fun gaming experience
when it works the  is awesome but for  when it works just doesnt cut it for meas a matter of fairness i should note that the turnaround time on my service order was pretty short exactly  weeks from unit failure to the arrival of the replacement and that my replacement unit has not yet had any troublethe jury is in and microsoft loses
sorry but after owning an xbox  for over  months and a ps for less time i have decided that the xbox  is the inferior product
i dont play games on the console that often preferring the pc for most shooters
however because of console only titles i bought this system
despite the light usage the xbox  finally died with the famous  rings of death red lights
i sent it in for repairs which were at least under warranty and despite the fact that microsoft said it would be fixed or replaced in  business days they had it for over a week before sending it backthe other big downside to the xbox  is the noise factor
with the dvd drive going the system makes so much racket i can hear it over the games i am playing
considering that one game is nascar  that is saying quite a lot
no way i would ever use the xbox  for watching movies
now that bluray has won the high def dvd wars i bought a ps and was pleasantly surprised that the unit makes almost no noise even while playing movies
sony knows how to make hardwareif it werent for mass effect i would have sold the machine long ago
while i have heard the elite version is more quiet and has fixed the problems of overheating i cant convince myself to give microsoft any more money after this horrible experiencethe xbox  is excellent as far as game selection xbox live controller configuration fun factor and system options but is the worst product ive ever purchased as far as reliability and customer service
i am on my fifth console in about a year and a half
customer service says theyre sorry but keeps shipping refurbished consoles that break again after several months
i have had two brand new consoles and two refurbished consoles
all have broken
i requested a refund and was told no
i asked if they could guarantee to ship a new unit not a refurb
no
instead they offered expedited shipping of my return box and a free complimentary game
game of my choice
no
i could choose from two
two that youd find in the clearance bin at walmart
microsoft refuses to address the main issue that they are selling a crummy product and charging people  for it
i paid 
they think they can give people a free budget game a month of xbox live gold and a used  console and everything is going to be all right
i guess theyll keep shipping refurbs for three years until all the warranties expire and then they can wash their hands of it all and the consumer takes the loss
its a shame because during the months that i actually have the console in my home instead of in the mail its a solid system with few flaws
but i cant deal with the crummy reliability and disastrous customer service
seriously consider another system if youre lookingi bought a  about a year ago
i only feel qualified to review it as a system now because i can safely say i owned this system for the entire length of its functional life and dont think ill be getting much more out of it since it no longer worksthats an exaggeration
itll work again
i just have to get an entirely new disc drive for itwhich brings me to the strange duality of the  on one hand there are some truly great games available for it and only for it
the graphics its capable of are superb the standard wireless controllers are outstanding and theyre even designed rather ergonomically
and yetbefore something can be good it has to functionlet me tell you a quick story for comparative purposes
the first system i ever owned was a sega master system
 folks
being a kid i kicked the heck out of it
dropped it
spilled stuff on it
treated the cartridges poorly
my brother enjoyed chewing on the electrical cables seriously
guess what
its in the other room right now still hooked up and functioning perfectly including the chewed cords nothing a little tape didnt fixon the other hand my xbox  was treated like it was the statue of a deity
it had its own particular spot wellventilated was never knocked over spilled upon or spoken to vulgarly
if i had to move it i wrapped it up in a blanket so it wouldnt get dinged
and less than a year after buying itit breaks downsolifespan comparisons
sega master system   years and counting
xbox    monthsreally if youre going to be charging people hundreds of dollars at least have the common courtesy to use quality parts
i can understand not building them to military specifications but can it at least last a year before it breaks down
i may be fixing my  but you can bet its the last time i trust this company with my moneynext time im going with a playstationwhich given also break down
but it seems they dont do it with nearly the regularity and predictability of the xbox
sorry microsoft
you had two chances
oh right i forgot to mention
i also owned an xbox
guess what
it stopped reading discs afterabout a year
seems to be a patterni like the game but it gets repetitive and boring after the th level
i guess i want more action and different landscapes
still searching for the right gamei am a point and click gamer and i love agatha christie unfortunately this game doesnt provide much enjoymentthe plot is there the graphics are ok and if you love clicking over the place in many areas to find what poirot is supposed to do next then fine
but if you are looking for a good mix of plot with some puzzles thrown in to break the tedium then you are in for a disappointmentthere are only  puzzles  one piece together a letter and once a puzzle box
the rest is all find the items and use them but that doesnt really rescue the game as there is so much dialogue
if you havent read the book and wish it to be like a more interactive book then this game might be for you but for gamers looking for some puzzles etc then keep on lookingyou dont even get the book with this game
the st game in the series was the best and then there were none the second one is more like this game long dialogue so if you liked that one you might like this onei enjoyed the st ac game very much the nd one was soso far too much talking and not enough gaming not to mention some very strange puzzle solutionsi found  to be worse than ever
not ony is the voice acting horrible it is not david suchet in fact it sounds like a spanish poirot but hastings looks like mr potato headthe fact that you go back in time as poirot was intriguing but once again talk talk talk and there was no direction to the beginning of the game
there was a stranger finger you go back in time and then wham you just start walking around
there is no introduction to the other characters etci do not reccomend this game at all
the only reason i gave it  stars at all was because the graphics were nice aside from hastingsits a shame every time i play agatha christie games i start out enjoying them and than hit a wallthey become boringwalking around this place is so slow and time consumingmakes me go to sleep sooner than i likei just wish there wasnt so many locked doors people i cant findboring puzzlesi guess over all its ok but the investigating is slow goingi need more action less traveling and less dialogei just cant get into this seriesthe orient express was better since it was confined to the train mostlythis place is just too big if ya know what i mean
graphics are very good but the investigating and walking everywhere over and over again is tortureive been a huge fan of rpgs for quite sometime now
as i became older fps games were getting really tired for me
run and gun games seemed to easy and didnt require muchbrain power
alright heres the deal
the game starts out amazing and then a huge downfall right after you leave vault   oblivion was the best rpg to ever come out and im still playing that game today
fallout  has so many flaws i turned it in  days after playing it i also completed the main story within that period of time hours of gameplay or something
the main story isnt that long
the traveling system is just annoying
you have to walk  miles from one place to another while you get attacked constantly by a bunch of mutant monsters and whatnot
this game looks like a madmax type of genre so why couldnt they add some cool vehicles with barb wire and metal shields like something out of deathracemadmax
you have to walk alllll the way back and forth from place to place to get something done
the game is besically go to point a and do this and then return to point b  this game is getting so many great reviews and ratings its unbelieveable
im sorry but i just couldnt get into the game
i tried my heart out and it just didnt work for me
again every review ever made is based on someones opinion
im sure a lot of people love this game
but ill tell you one thing if you dont have a lot of spare time on your hands youre not going to get anywhere in this game
it takes forever to get something accomplished
and when you die when youre in the middle of walking  miles to point b you start back at point a  yay i get to walk all the way back againall in all the game is tiring
the only part i loved was when i blew up m
cant say the name bc it would be a spoiler
but that was awesome ill give it that much
other than that yeah i turned the game
im glad i still dont have it i got like  for itfirst off i explect ill get a lot of flack for thinking this game stinksunless you find reading hours and hours of text the best gaming ever  id stay away from this one
argh
another sixty dollars spent on rubbish this crap is killing mei have to say i was shocked at how bad the graphics were
after having just come off playing dead space maybe i expected too much from fallout   i dont know  but they are unbelievably blahyour character moves so slow itll have you screaming for a run button once you leave vault  the vat system was supposed to change the way of gaming instead it its a cheap gimmick that unfortunately takes a back seat to the rest of the games boring gameplay
it held some potential however i found most of the time it was just easier to run  or should i say  walk and guni think fans of oblivion will really enjoy fallout  and will probably rate my review negatively however like i said before unless you find slow moving characters surprisingly bad graphics and reading hundreds of lines of text thrilling  you can safely skip this title and know youre not missing anythingfinal notei was really looking forward to this title and after having been so impressed with dead space i cant begin to express my disappointment here
it was like a bad movie that you kept watching because you kept telling yourself its going to get better but sadly it does not
i was really surprised at the sad graphics and how your character merely floats over the terrain with some simple leg animation when playing in thirdperson
im just sadly disappointed  what a load of rubbishi heard and read all the great reviews for this game so when i finally got an xbox  it was one of the top games on my list to try
im sorry to say it was a huge disappointment
i just found it all to be too slow paced and so nit pickingly complicated that i didnt even want to try and finish playing it
i guess i just like games to be more straightforward and fast paced
i have played both mass effect and mass effect  which are rpgs and enjoyed them but fallout just has so many variables that you have to constantly take into account with every single action that you take
it required too much time and effort
i play video games for fun and to relax and fallout wasnt fun or relaxingthis game is a prettier more violent version of harry potter and the order of the phoenix another video game sedative that will bring you back to the good old days when your parents ran your life
go here find this do this
no i dont enjoy spending hours just walking around
because of the ridiculous number of great reviews ive given this game  chances to become enjoyable and it cant do it
i will forever be confused as to why so many love fallout   this game is a ford tempoi really disliked this game
i read reviews and every where and everyone said this is one of the greatest games of the year and one of the greatest of all time
boy was i let down
graphics are pretty good but thats it
bugs galore in almost every aspect of the game
main and sidequests were boring
side quests were especially boring cus they are all the standard fare go kill this thing go save that person the usual and none were really that exciting
walking around everywhere made it even more boring cus nothing made it exciting
there is a lot to explore but most of it is emptiness
also i felt no connection to any other characters in game and it felt like none had any connection with me
voice acting was mediocre and it should be top notch with how much there is
i didnt like vats
at all
low lvl cap is ridiculous
once you get to the higher levels you are practically invincible which made it even more boring cus there is no challenge
ending sucked
just so much wrong with this game
i was highly dissapointedi bought fallout  for the pc because it received glowing reviews on  as did its predecessor fallout   i totally missed the boat on that one so i rolled up my sleeves with enthusiasm and got full swing into fallout unfortunately this should go down as a classic example of a video game that while it has an easy interface and superb graphics is simply no fun to play
at least not for mei grew up in the american southwest so walking over a blasted desert is to me certainly not romantic or fun  i did a lot of that growing up
just walking through the sun shooting the occasional stray dog or giant cockroach
boringmaybe somebody from north of the arctic circle would find this game interesting but i dont
i basically looks like youre walking through any depressed town in southern arizonaas for the gamemakers arranging it so that you can run around and have your own adventure and ignore the main quest of finding your father etc
 that kind of freedom has worked well in the grand theft auto series mainly because you can disport yourself by driving around in stolen ferrarisbut in this game you freedom consists of the ability to stumble over broken rocks through dried vegetation and across cracked asphalt  all the while under a blazing sunheck
i dont require a video game for thati bought this as a gift for a friend i thought itd be compatible with steam and its not
i also had to go online and find the work around to get it running without crashing
its built for an older processor so you have to change something in the files to get it to run on a newer computer
it was more of a hassle than it was worth just buy it on steam guys then you can easily get the dlc toogood things about this game absolutely stunning graphics the best ive seen beautiful level design
an insane amount of effort must have been put into making the areas so super detailed
one cant shake the impression that theyre in a postapocalpytic world lots of random encounters and other neat crap can be found while just wandering about the wasteland
there doesnt seem to be any requirement to play the tedious quests
it is a real blast to wander about the wastelandsbad things about this game tedious repetitive and uninteresting oblivionstyle go fetch quests inside of buildings baddies will not respawn after you kill them
monsters respawn only in the outside wastelands the maximum character level is  if you try to play this game thinking that youll level up indefinitely like you do in oblivion you will be in for a rude surprise  the perks and skills you select when you level up need to be done with the their usefulness after you reach the limit in mind
also level  is only enough to get one skill to  or two skills if you ignore all the rest so dont expect to ever have a powerful character
there is a console command that is supposed to allow the player to advance past this maximum setgs imaxcharacterlevel  but my the game crashes no matter what when trying to go past level  even with this cheat enabled
i am presuming that this stupid maximum level is here to accomodate some future expansion pack that will raise this limit higher
grrr copy protection did not allow me to install the game
i instead downloaded a pirated cracked copy thanks reloaded
and installed that
later when the first patch came out i copied my falloutlaunderexe from my dvd so i could patch the game as long as i have the disc in the drive the game plays without any lip from the securom copy protection the game locks up quite a bit
in fact playing this game requires that you be okay with doing a hard reset of your machine every so often because of the lock ups
be aware that the first patch  caused my game to become nearly unplayable due to the increased rate of lockups which this patch was supposed to reduce and i dont recommend installing this particular patch  of the time quicksaves get eaten after exiting the game and returning
do not rely on them if you enjoy not having to do the same stuff over and over again because your savegame got lost
autosaves and manual saves seem to work fine imbalanced role playing doing quests the evil way often results in a lesser reward than if you completed them using the good way
grrr numerous types of bugs in quests some of which render them uncompletable
numerous typos in dialog
obvious places where flags should have been set to trigger an event or some dialog but dont get set for some reason and so nothing special happens as a result of your actions game does not allow you to harm children eating raider corpses is okay though i got to a point in my game where regardless of what i did the game would lock up after one to five minutes
i started a new game and didnt have this problem but my old game was still broken
i guess at this point im waiting for the next patch level to come out before giving it another trymy recommendationdo not buy this game right now
wait until the end of its life cycle a couple years when it has been patched thoroughly and all the expansions which it seems in this case are really just missing parts of the original game have been released
then i think you should consider buying iti have been playing pc games ever sence there were pc gamesi purchased a new pc just to play the new bunch of exciting games comming out just to find thy were going to install a virus on my new pci purchased fallout  because it promised just to have a disk checkthis is what i have ran in to so farfirst it did not put an icon on my desktop so every time i want to play the game i have to remove the dvd and reinsert itthe game will freeze or crash ever so oftenwhen the game freezes i have to turn off my pc manually something you should never doonce when i started my new pc it announced that i had lost windows possibly because of a software i had installed and i should run my recovery diski turned off the pc and restarted it luck was on my sideit started normallyi dont know if securom is the problem but i do know that in all my years of playing games i have never ran to anything like thisit can not be the pc because it has more than enough resources to play on the highest settingsthe game is not really all that goodthere is no real story line other than searching for your father and doing side quests to earn money to buy and upgrade worn out equiptmentthe game gets pretty repetitive after awhilego here get in a firefight
go there get in basicly the same firefightone good thing is you can save anywhere and you need toyour apponents seem to be better equipped than you and never miss a shotyou on the other hand can empty a whole clip point blank in there chest with a newley repaired assault rifle and not even slow them downthen when you search the body you find thy are using a worne out piece of crapi think i will play the other new games on my x box and save my pc from further damage until securom and starforce are just bitter memoriesbuy this game at your own riski am not affiliated with anyone i am just an old gammer and know something is not right with this gamehype too much floating around still about this game
i was a huge fan of fallout  and  liked oblivion and morrowind but when combinedmehthe world is deadnot in an apocalyptic sense as in lifelessredundant npcs overused filler like how many times do i have to look at the same traincar in every subway
oh wow another pointless pile of sandbags
oooh another storage closet with tin cans and broom handles say it isnt so
too much reused backdrop everywhere periodboring
the gameplay is not that fun much better first person shooters out there way better rpgs out therethe whole package just feels pointless and lacks compelling elements to keep me playing voice acting was weak in delivery
story was meh not for buy this one at  trust meafter spending a week playing this game i have concluded that i am pretty disappointed in the game
while the freedom and graphics are nice there were some negatives i just cant overcome
here is the list of things that really bothered metoo few levels  seems like you can reach level  pretty quickly and being a rpg the fact that your character just cant grow anymore is bothersome
as big as the game is i think its ridiculous youd cap out on levels so quicklymaxed out stats  its too easy to get stat boosters in the game
eventually all your special stats becomes s
if every road you take arrives at the same destination then where is the choice and customization
the way the game is set up itd be better if your special stats could go over  while your natural starting stats could not exceed  skills too
skills should be allowed to go over  like in the old fallout gamesspeech  in the old fallout games having poor speech skills severely limited your dialogue options and had a significant impact on what your character can do
in fallout  it just doesnt matter much
the additional choices you get from high speech skills are very minor at bestphysical world anomalies  youd see highway overpasses and buildings crumbled and yet right next to them a billboard would stilll be standing
youd think the weakest structures would be the first to goelectrical power many buildings still have lights and electrical power
nuff saidwashington dc geography  the white house should be directly north of the washington monument but in the game it is to the northeast
the lincoln memorial is very close to the river but in the game it is much too far inland
arlington national cemetery is wall too far to the south in the game
falls church chevy chase arlington fairfax and germantown are all in the wrong relative locationsvaults  the vaults are all really above ground cover by a small hill
a real vault would be really underground like you either need to trek a long ways down or need to take an elevatorradiation  you cant get rid of radiation by filtering itintel celeron   ghz xfx  gts mb foxconn gmc kingston mb pc wdaajb gb ide westinghouse lnm monitornothing wrong with the game i just found it boring
i played a few hours thats all i could muster before uninstalling
portal  is more interesting
i think my dislike comes from this seeming to be more of an rpg roll playing game then the fps first person shooter that i like
tomb raider starcraft return to castle wolfenstein fear
are more my style
i am glad i gave it a shot with how much i hear people saying they like the game  it just wasnt for mei also had to change the ini file to make it work with my quad core computerthis is just another oblivion with some scifi make over
big chunk of conversation makes me falling to sleep
not my type of gamethe game works ok and will appeal to certain individuals just not to methis is a first impression though and maybe it will pick up as i continue to play itjust to keep it shortthis game is amazingly prettyif your puter can accomodate the graphics load check out the bethesda forum for the screams of underpowered gamers
terrific d and concept stuff which one can enjoy during the long long long treks between places where something happens walks punctuated by rather pointless attacks from various mutant creatures that always sneak up from behind and take several precious shots from a mm pistol to deck
what finally happens is predictable assailantoutofthedark stuffbeen there done thatthe initial interminable vault level looks like tired redraws of something from doom or  or whateverwhacking cockroaches is soso yesterday
and youd think after  years in the vault someone would have freshened the painti felt myself wondering as i wandered in the wasteland what all the fuss in the gamerpress was about all those point googoos on metacritic because i just wasnt very interested in getting past the various challenges to levelup to a point where my character could do some real damage
the ruinschic stuff grows old pretty fast and you notice that a lot of the structures get recycled a lot
did they borrow the terrainengine from company of heroesthat popup grass looks pretty familiarthe facial animations also muchdiscussed are pathetic reallyand the whole dialog qanda thingy is tedious like taking a long multiplechoice test to get into the college of your choice
the story is muddledbut if you want a story read a graphic novel kidsquestsschmests
why botherthe gamebusiness is in a real crisis period getting prettier but entirely predictable from the storyconcept aspect
how many more of these ramble around and get whacked things does the world really need
or is the teenaged attentionspan really that shortfallout three is another in a long line of post apocalyptic game scenariosit is a role playingfps combo which has become quite popular within the last few yearsthe pluses to this game are the great looking graphics and the ability to explore this expansive worldthere is an impassable borderedgeso you cant go on foreverit also has a catchy story to it and it is easy to get immersed and sit for hours playing itthe negatives to this are the very old style looking characters and game play with weapons and gunsi have games older than ten years whose characters look and play better than thisalsoand most importantlyespecially for win playersare the repeated and random game crashesi have only played this on win so i cannot comment on earlier windows versionsbut i would suggest not buying this game if you have anything over winvista because of that extremely annoying issueand i am surprised at a game company like bethesda not coming out with a fix for this platformconsidering it runs on windows livebe warnedps
lest i get a your drivers need updatingresponse from bethesda or anyone re the game crashesi can assure you all of my drivers on my system are right up to datei have driver detective to keep it all rightthank you very muchoverall i am pretty disappointed with kane  lynch
usually eidos makes really great games like hitman so i had high expectations for this titlethe graphics for this game are soso and kinda of glitchy  for example your characters sometimes walk through walls or other people
the game controls are difficult and make it very hard to complete missions
kane ends up being more of a deadweight instead of a helpful teammate
the game doesnt seem to be very realistic
it sometimes takes  shots to an enemys head before he dies
another frustrating thing is that there arent many save points within the game so you end up having to start over from the beginning of the scene whenever you diehonestly i think this game would be a whole lot better if the developers had taken more time to work out the kinks before releasing it
to me its not worth the  i spent
youre better off waiting a while and picking up a used copyin all fairness i really wanted to like this game
i gave it a fair shot and rented it out
after completing it ive decided that kane  lynch had a lot of potential that got turned into a level rehash of michael manns bank robbery scene from the movieheatthe game description tells usthis is a violent and chaotic journey of two men  a flawed mercenary and a medicated psychopath
each hates the other but must work together to save themselves
play kane in singleplayer mode and either character in twoplayer coop mode
the reality is yes two men who hate each other are teamed up  but they should direct their hate towards the game control system
we can only change two buttons in the options screen so if you dont like the layout of the controls youve got to suck it uppassing a weapon to another character is not fluid  holding the r button and using the dpad to choose a weapon is simply not possible in a heated firefightin singleplayer mode kane shows up to the left of the screen not centered as one would expect
if you play as lynch which can only be done in coop mode hes on the right side of the screenits usually standard for games to offer playability as either of the protagonists but that wasnt done herethe game description tells usviolence erupts in meticulously created safe worlds realistic and responsive environments and crowds react when events get of out control
manipulate the environments and crowds strategically to complete objectives
the reality is yes if you fire a bullet in a crowded dance hall the characters start screaming like an yearold girl who saw michael jackson in  however the crowd movement is totally inaccurate
everyone is able to make it outside but mysteriously no patrons are trampled to death as one would expecti dont know what it means to use the crowds to complete objectives as the crowds in this game act like medicated sheep that dont react to much other than gunfirethe game description tells uswide variety of intense rd person game play rappel from buildings firing on the run or from moving vehicles launch surprise attacks lay down cover fire and shoot blind from around corners hurl smoke tear and incendiary grenades
the reality is you can do all these things and the variety of weapons is impressive
however lynch usually starts every level with the shotgun as his primary weapon
in a game where most of your adversaries are firing from afar with rifles lynchs shotgun is virtually useless
sure you can change the weapon out with a better one but why is the crappy weapon always the defaultalso the camera angles in singleplayer mode are agonizing
since the camera has kane left of center if youre behind an object and try to do a closeup aim on kanes enemies youll get a screen full of kanes bald spot instead
it doesnt help that the targeting reticule is the size of the period at the end of this sentencethe game description tells usfast and intuitive combat lead a crew of criminal mercenaries to increase your chance of survival
you can also fight alone you will automatically draw fire throw grenades lay down cover and engage in close combat with their own signature moves
the reality is the description doesnt mention that the criminal mercenaries have no survival instincts whatsoever
if you dont keep them on a tight leash theyll walk right into a heated firefight and try to stop their enemies with a devious trick jumping in front of the bullets they shootyou will typically do most of the work yourself while the mercenaries pick off the leftovers
as far as signature moves once youve seen kane break someones neck for the th time it gets boringthe game description tells ustwoplayer cooperative game play team up and play the full story with a friend as either kane or lynch
at any point in the game you can choose to play the next or previous levels in coop
innovative multiplayer levels up to  players
the reality is i dont see what they mean by playing the full story in coop mode  the only real difference between single player and coop mode is seeing some events from lynchs perspective which we can already deduce from kanes reactions in single player modeplaying previous levels or present levels is a standard feature so theres nothing innovative herei havent come across  players who want to tackle kane  lynch let alone  people who want to play it at the same timekane  lynch is entertaining for a little bit but the gameplay degenerates quickly into a repeating loop of showing a major gunfight  then another  then another  and then another
excessive gunfights and generous heapings of cursing cant save this game
i wouldnt recommend kane  lynch for anything other than a rentalthe aiming on this game doesnt work well
the cover system also doesnt work well
i bought this thinking i could play online coop with a friend and that was not in the game
its only local coop
i would only recommend this game if its on the cheap side like i got it forthe seller provided this game very quickly
this game is a third person shooter that follows  nuts who go around shooting anyone and everyone
the graphics are ok but the story is almost non existenteven o n the easy setting this game is ridiculously difficultthere isnt  section of any level that i didn t get killed on
this game is a waste of your time and moneyi was looking forward to kane  lynch dead men an action game where you play as a mercenary and a psychopath who team up
the concept sounds cool but the game is sadly an ultimate failure
the cool concept gets killed thanks to some unbelievably bad controls even more unbelievably bad ai a surprisingly lame story and so many utterances of the fword to make the game seem gritty that a majority of the story and dialogue just comes off as laughable
if you manage to get passed what i just mentioned youll find some mindless gunplay to be had along with some interesting twists on the multiplayer modes even though there is no online coop mode but whether or not you get that far into the game is another story
let it also be said that kane  lynch isnt as bad as many of the reviews here make it out to be and while the graphics arent anything to write home about theyre not terrible either
all in all kane  lynch dead men may be worth a glimpse at best but other than that this can be easily avoidedthis is a game that enjoys one of the most solid storylines that came out of game developing in the last  years
unfortunately this was not enoughyou are kane an aged mercenary and former member of a criminal brotherhood known as the  the last heists failed you get arrested and convicted  yet you are a traitor in the s books anyway
having you for making off with the loot somehow they send lynch a psychotic easily distracted and pillpopping murderer to first break you out of prison and then make sure he gets their money back
they are sure you will play ball they have kidnapped your wife and daughter to ensure itnow this is a foundation to built a great tps game
unfortunately kane  lynch does not reach the top floor as the game demonstrates all the flaws of a rushed releasethe character movements feel too scripted and automatic at some places a console leftover i guess whereas they have to be spoonfed detailed directions at some others
since one cannot predict where the one or the other will occur it will eventually get on your nervesthe squad curse is not lifted for kane  lynch either the ai of your squad is infantile at best  but you will be thankful that your enemies do not demonstrate a higher one eitheralso the game is pretty short it shouldnt take you more than  hours on normal difficultygraphically this is a beautiful game  notably though not at par with say crysis
keep in mind that the strength of kane  lynch is its storythe gameplay and the cutscenes blend seamlessly and the story flows like an alist movie
and you will definitely not get bored from the inside of a prison to rappelling from a skyscraper to escaping a packed tokyo dance clubalthough a well developed character story and a visually well designed game they did not complete their follow througha disappointmentokay apparently this game is fun enough for some but this game which claims to be for the whole family is just not
period
when i put it ages  and  its asking them questions that are way above thier heads im a teacher so i know what these ages should and should be able to answer
also it is so heavily loaded with sports trivia that if you are not a sports buff you cannot play the game lol
i suppose well keep it but ill probably only pull it out when my brothers and sisters are around because they are into sports much more than i am
in fact i think i may send it to them since its just not suited for us
i think the concept and the way the game is played is good but it is narrowly focused and the product package does not give a good impression of what is actually delivered
asking a  year old to add  and if you dont know detailed information in many categories youll find its boring because your friends will get all the scores
for example one of the question that the game asks might be something like this which team won the grey cup in 
i think its not neccessary to remember it because i can easily find it on the internetim glad i rented itthis is a jeopardylike trivia game where families can work together to race the clock eg
answer  questions correctly before the time runs out
we are able to complete a round in under  minutes  which makes this game great for quick play
the questions are categorized  books sports history science you do not get to pick the category however
contestants are kept engaged by shaking or waving their remote jumping or dancing to add time to the clock
in bonus round answer  correct in a row you add time to the clock through a game of tugofwarwhy this game was a miss all text  if your child is a slow reader or cannot read  playing is very difficult especially as the answers are not labeled abcd  which would at least allow her to say a cow is right  and find the a too heavy on the sports  ummm yeah
i dont know who scored how many touchdowns in what superbowl and neither do the kidlets  your mileage may vary too light on the science  its at a th grade level too heavy on the books  some are obscure and i read alot lots of obscure questions within each category who was raised where that i suppose were to keep parents interested  instead they just frustrated the kidlets question database too small  i saw repeats after the nd roundi lovebig brain academy wii degreeas it is equally engaging and does not require super readers
while inexpensive i would take a pass on smarty pantsi just received this game thinking it would fun since im a trivia buff
unfortunatly i wish i knew that if you try to play it in single player mode you cant use your mii or have your information saved
maybe it will be fun at a party but maybe not i prefer tv show king party which i downloaded to my wii for ten bucks through wiiwarei was excited to play this game after all the hype
unfortunately i found the game to be extremely disappointing
as mentioned in other reviews the save function for the game is poorly implemented causing the player to repeat large aspects of the gameadditionally i was frustrated that the enemies continually respawn if you reenter an area
this discourages exploration of the maps especially when you find yourself short of ammoits unfortunate that these shortcomings hamper the game to this degree
i thought the environments graphics and sounds were top notch  but the gameplay left me frustrated and disappointedoverall not a bad game but not really a good one either
it has a lot of potential the atmosphere and storyline is good the creatures are well done and can be frustrating to kill in a good way and the sound and controls are both well done
however the gameplay itself is a bit monotonous and frustrating
its not always clear where you need to go next and the severe lack of ammo and ability of enemies to respawn in a particular area makes exploring next to impossible
only allowing game saves at the end of a chapter can at times make this a very difficult game
or at least an annoying one if youve already solved most of the chapter already
all in all worth a look at but unless you really like the genre you are better off with something elseomg this game just hurt me because i really liked it until the save system reared its ugly head
it doesnt save
even though it says its saving you will still start at the beginning of the chapter if you die and you will die alot and all enemies respawn
plus theres bosses so if you die there youll still start all over from the beginning you even have to do puzzles over
i cant believe the developers thought this would be fun
as many others have pointed out here and in gaming reviews you have a really cool nightmare creaturessilent hilldoom game that you want to love but cant because you cant save and it seriously just killed the game
i couldnt even finish the game and im a hardcore gamerthe developers took alot of heat but they listened and fixed this is dementium  so please play that instead
its just sad because the game is really cool controls well except you cant finish it becauseyou guessed it no save
what a wasteat first i thought this was going to be a really cool game after playing touch the dead and being disappointed in that games rail system
i wanted a simmilar game where i had control over the character
however they may as well have put this one on a rail system as even with control over where you walk to you still follow the same paths each time with not much more then  directions to chose to go in usually either path results in ending in the same spotas you should have figured out its a shooter game much of the style of doom  duke nukem games
however most of this game requires you to carry a flash light to see in dark areas and then switch to a weapon when a zombie or monster creature attacks
i got fed up with that idea and used a game shark cheat to make it always light
maybe some people might enjoy that idea but i thought it was just annoying after a whileas you progress your itinerary consists of a flash light a night stick a hand gun a magnum a sawgrinder shotgun sniper rifle  machine gun
by the time i had reached the end of this game i was bored with all these weapons and seemed very disappointing to me that a boss that appears a couple of times in this game got a minigun to use ya know that weapon usually found on military choppers that arnie used in terminator i think there is around about  levels give or take a few and by the time i was half way through those i was bored at the repetitiveness of each level
in fact i was bored stupid by the time i got to the final boss and rolled my eyes when the boss keeps saying the same things over and over again until you defeat him
then to top it off the ending was just a complete wtf moment
a major let downthe lack of options and extra games really has become a trademark of so many nds games
this one is no exception with  other games to play other then the main game
no two player no wifi no nothing
and when you have completed the game if you go back to your saved file and continue you go straight back to the final level you can not choose previous levels and there is absolutely nothing at all to unlock and make you want to sit through playing the game again from the beginningeven tho it was longer then touch the dead i still only grant this game half a star better then that one
it was fun at first but the same thing over and over and over again becomes tiresome and boring after a whilehave this game for the wi which grandson loves and plays all the time
when he received a ds for christmas bought this game which is much harder to play
he is only  but even his sister which is  has problems playing the game alsobeware  there is a lot of reading involved in this game making it difficult of younger kids
my  year old is frequently frustrated with this game
wish i had picked something elsei purchased this game used on a preplayed discount rack
cartridge based games are a bit safer used purchased then a disc but now im wishing i would have bought something for my psp that daythe box clearly advertises that it is turn based combat this is not what most rpg players would define as turn based battle
you encounter enemies and depending on what weapon you have slash them with it as many times as possible by pressing the a button as fast as you can and have no control over the damage you takethis had potential to be a good dungeon crawler but falls short in many areas the worst being the combat
the graphics are fairly cheap and outdated
i actually dont mind the element of dungeon crawler gameplay that consists of moving one space at a time  the etrian oddyssey series as well as others are like that
that comparison being drawn this game is nothing like eo
series which is why there is no sequel to this one
its a poorly developed makeshift rpg slapped together to make a few bucks off of rpg fans looking for a good old school style dungeon crawler to enjoy and instead find this
i didnt even get the free wand stylus since it was used a gimmick that would have made me feel a little bit better about my wasted  dollarsfinal words on orcs and elves for the ds dont buy itthis game isnt for anyone under   if youre old youre gonna love this crap
i turned this game off after a few minutes thats how boring it gotthis is the most beautiful game on the ps gorgeous artwork but the game play and the battle system let it down
very rarely do i get stuck in a game but i did with this oneto start off i know countless people absolutely love this game
i however am not one of those people
i played through the story and i just didnt like how it flowed
some parts made no sense to me and there were way too many cutscenes
at parts in the story i had no idea where to go and what to do when i finally found out it wasnt a sense of satisfaction it was more a feeling of oh that was a stupid way to go a feeling of disappointment
the graphics however were good not incredible but good and the locations you go to are fun and interesting for the most part
however i wasnt a fan too strongly of the controls and drake just left too much to cinematics and strange story to me
not my favoritei liked this game but not enough
it had no puzzles just endless jungle no enemies worth a good fight just pirates with aks no guncollecting you just carry  guns tops and no ammo and have to pick up guns dropped by the men you kill
it was nowhere close as complex or awesome as the tomb raider series
it took an leisurely h to finish  days at h a day and barely entertained me at all
i dont get how the game got so many good ratings but then again maybe new gamers are kids and teens who dont really know whats good
tomb raider  was good
ff was good
super metroid was good
drakes fortune
not so goodthis game gets  stars because the graphics are good and the theme is interesting
however how can a guy take a shot to the head and still keep running
every enemy must be shot at least  times to die so if you aim perfectly and shoot the guy in the head he still keeps shooting at you and you need to pop him  more times
just plain ridiculous
the waves of enemies keeps you from progressing to more interesting parts
the beginning was fun as there was puzzle solving and interesting things to do but once you get to chapter  the game becomes a shooting arcade and having the enemy keep running and shooting at you once you have popped him squarely in the head makes this game so very dull
too bad
they had a good concept
im wondering about the age range and education level of those who give this game  stars
not that being young or still not have a higher education is a bad thing its just that the  and somethings have different expectations of gamesi remember  review somewhere saying if ur not playing this u are not taking full advantage of ur ps
for me its a safe bet that playing uncharted is not taking full advantage of anything for the system whatsoeverpretty much the gripes i have with uncharted are all over the place
shooting people gets to be a bore after a while not to mention that that form of combat is broken
the puzzles are fun to say the least and the graphics are pretty much of the only selling point for this game like the much overrated call of duty series and its pratically a tomb raider wannabei am sorry but like the call of duty series this is another saga i would advise to safely give this a pass
if ur playing stuff like rachet and clank sly cooper and god of war id say ur taking full advantage of the ps
all the other exclusives sony has released in the past are better than this incredibly overrated garbagethis could be a lot more fun if the physics engine provided better control of movements and aiming
ive aimed to jump straight ahead only to land off to the side of my target
the result is needless frustration and a poor experience
i have many other games and this is easily the least desirable
i do not recommend this gamevery repetitive gameplay at least in the first third of the game
the same looking goons algorithmically pop up out of nowhere from the exact same places and runfire at you once you cross into next zone
you see the same barechested chunky guy always with the shotgun and maybe  other types
once you clear the assault move to the next area and repeat
no boss fights no unique strategy to beat a stage
so called puzzles are trivial
graphics is at best average for ps
kinda funny how a video reporter girl serenely walks in the old keep for half hour shooting a video apparently not noticing any signs of trouble while the protagonist searches for her and in the process kills like  bad guys infesting the place including firing from high caliber guns and throwing grenades
is she deaf and invisiblealthough this game did have its strong points overall it was very disappointing
since plenty of people have been discussing what a great game this is ill let them tell you about the pros while focusing on the cons for this review
uncharted was ps game of the year in   if this is the best ps had to offer at the time its obvious why they fell so far behind xbox  until the recent price drop and emergence of the ps slim
lackluster at best i was pretty unimpressed with this oneone of the first things that bugged me about this game was the fact that guns and ammo left behind by enemies will mysteriously disappear if you wander too far from them
this doesnt always happen so sometimes youll try to empty one weapon before picking up another since drake can only carry one type of any particular weapon one handgun one machine gun and a handful of grenades
after stepping ten yards from a weapon it may or may not be there for you to return to afterward
further the bodies of slain enemies show no signs of damage and disappear soon after you kill them
what is this further there was a lot of hoppyjumpy crap going on in this game
for the most part drake is capable of handling it
but on certain levels the most annoying of problems will occur
for instance youll climb up a chain to a platform
hanging within jumping distance is another chain that seems to lead to a stairway
it seems obvious that you should jump to the next chain
but no no
the next chain is illusoryincorporeal
its just a graphic and you cant touch it
stupid gamer
you should have known that even though it is identical to the chain you just climbed up
now you will fall to your death
similarly drake is often asked to climb along ledges
youll jump and climb from ledge to ledge
then itll seem fairly obvious that youre supposed to jump to the next ledge
but no no
although it appears identical the next ledge may just be a graphic
again fall to your death you stupid gamer
also the idiot woman who accompanies you on most of your adventures is totally annoying
she runs in front of your gun when youre firing at enemies effectively blocking you
worse still she often takes the best vantage point for herself leaving you in a really bad position to attack your enemies
thankfully she if fairly handy with a gun  a necessary tradeoff
but whats really annoying about her is the fact that shes supposed to follow you around
this doesnt stop her from running into unexplored areas time and again while youre searching for ammo and treasure
as shirley manson might say stupid girl you stupid girl
and finally i would be remiss not to mention the fact that your journal can only be opened at certain very select spots
so if you think you may have missed something the only way to return and check your journal is to die and hope you dont respawn in a place where you cannot get back to the spot you need to be in to check the journal
stupid
very poor programmingfrom what i understand uncharted  is supposed to be great
but after playing this one im hesitant to even give uncharted  a rentaltreasure hunter game full of adventure
sounds too good to be true
it is
too bad the write up contains more adventure then the gameprosthe story was interesting albeit unrealistic looking for lost treasure in the jungle and finding lost uboats in rivers hanging off a waterfall
dialog was pretty goodgraphics were goodconsi would call this game a shooter not an action adventure game
adventure games generally involve some puzzle solving
the only puzzle solving in this game is making drake jump from ledge to ledge
the game required too much jumping and swinging from ledges and ropes
the controls were not very responsive
frustration factor was very high
you will die a lot in this game due to falling from ledges and unreasonable scenarios such as having a gazillion pirates jumping off of cliffs and ledges shooting you down
if your character jumped off of those areas you would die
game only saves when checkpoints are reached thus a lot of replaying certain parts of the game
the game is very linearoutside of the voice acting and writing this isnt a very entertaining game
the cover system reminds me of gears of war and i found that unbearable
the fighting is sleepy as all you do is hide behind something and shoot
the puzzles in this game are a joke and they even offer you hints which you dont needwant especially after just finishing the god of war collection and i had to fight the camera too often
i dont know if im going to keep playing and hope it improves
and while ive read uncharted  is phenomenal after playing the first i dont know when ill ever get that gamebottom line do you like puzzles
dont get this game
do you hate games with cover systems splinter cell conviction was at least tolerable
dont get this game
do you like unique fighting mechanics such as batman arkham asylum
dont get this gamei purchased a ps to play the ps exclusives particularly the last of us and the uncharted trilogy
the last of us was incredible uncharteddrakes fortune was not
i originally thought i was going to give this three stars but i started really thinking about it and couldnt come up with much of anything i genuinely liked about the game
it wasnt a glitchy impossible to play mess but thats about all that is keeping it above one star for mei can forgive a lot from a game if the characters are really good or if the story is really captivating
i found myself completely disinterested in both these characters and the story
at no point did i ever find myself on the edge of my seat waiting for what may happen next
my fiancee and i get taking guesses on potential major plot twists that never came
i never even really found myself caring about the characters which i think is pretty sad given the length of the gamethe graphics may have been great in  but playing this in  i found them to be subpar
the music is even worse
it was generic and not very timely
after playing games like halo and the last of us where the music is both fantastic and nails the mood perfectly virtually every time this was a huge letdownthe gameplay itself was repetitive and uninteresting
the platformer elements added nothing to me and were more annoying than anything
especially on some of these elements i found the inability to control the camera angle infuriating
the rest of the game is a poor third person shooter
the weapons are not exciting especially early in the game
there is no autoaim so you spend a ton of time aiming
this would be excusable if you didnt spend  percent of the game behind cover shooting
the number of times you think you have won a shootout and begin to move on only to find that another wave of enemies has inexplicably shown up is innumerable
the number of times you have to shoot a guy in the chest with an ak is absurd and the dying animations are nothing short of comicalim not entirely sure what i expected from this game but for something that is so highly related by both gaming publications and gamers alike this was certainly not it
in fairness to this game the previous three games i played before this one were arkham city halo  and the last of us so it had some giant shoes to fill but based on the reputation i expected it would
i was let down in a huge wayi just downloaded and played the demo to this game over christmasthe graphics were nice but the game play was well annoying
it uses the new ps controler so you can move about like the wi so as far as advancement goes that is cool but the game play was just too stop and go for me
it reminded me too much of lost
id say this game is for the under  crowd and if i do buy it ill wait for it to go on sale used for 
i am still hooked on call of duty  online until the next grand theft auto and medal of honori cant believe this many people like this game
i really enjoyed this game as an adventure game in the first few levels but then got steadily more frustrating as the game went on
one of the top reviews mentions that its an action adventure disguised as a rdperson shooter this is pretty much exactly right
the game starts off as fun as an adventure game running through a beautiful landscape coming out to a gorgeous beach scene only to see an even more epic moment but as the game progresses on it just turns into a frustrating thirdperson shootersome of the biggest issues i had with the game the weak weapons you feel like youre doing absolutely no damage the horrible and frustrating cover controls whenever i tried to quickly switch cover because i was shot or it had been destroyed in order to quickly get out of cover you have to roll out well the roll automatically takes you to cover whether you want to or not or even if its the right cover i constantly had frustrating issues w this another frustrating game mechanic annoyance was with the jet ski levels frustrating to control while having to dodge objects and kill enemies now for the level design oh my god i have played many aaa games but yet to find one that has such terrible level design i kept getting lost in levels in where to go i understand its a puzzle game where you have to figure it out but its another to make just where youre supposed to go really hard to find
these are all big issues i had w this game but nothing compared to my biggest issue w this game so i would just like to put this in a question and then ask yourself whether you thought this was actually a good game so how are there people in caves that are only accessible through a puzzlesecret hidden door that hasnt been opened yet
by opening it you say
so if im solving the puzzle to gain entrance that means the door hasnt been opened so why am i fighting living people that btw you are never really sure of who they work for story related in  yr plus old unsolved puzzle caves
i mean cmon
now one of the lesser issues i had w the game was the story i guess i can spoil it since the top useful review already did it starts as a fun treasure hunting story following the heels of nathan drakes father once you get later into the story you meet these monsters at this point i couldnt help to say really you had no where to take the story so you added in monsters
this is the twist in the story
lame
people also have mentioned how great the graphics are yes i realize this was made in  but ive seen  games with better graphics ones w no graphical popins and jaggiesoverall w all these problems w the game this game is definitely not deserving of the high score everyone gives it and i do not recommend it quick overview story overall was not that great pretty good story at first but tends to decline and get worse especially toward the end gameplay mechanics are awful and annoying the games worth a rent but not buy i will be renting uc thoughedit i also forgot to mention cutscene problems had this issue a few times where you would walk into a room and you were supposed to walk up to an object which wasnt always clear which one to go to so you had to wander around the room just to trigger the cutscene while the cutscene could have just been triggered more easily by just walking into the room
my last problem w this game is more of an annoyance the ps whenever it read my disc it made this loud buzzing sound so it was a bit of an immersion killer
another annoying game mechanic i forgot was how you throw grenades i know sony wants to take advantage of their axis controller to sell their products but in order to throw grenades you have to use the motion controls in the controllers to change the distance in the arc of the grenade throw
it could be an interesting feature if in the right game w slower enemies but since it takes you out of cover and they shoot at you while youre adjusting the controller to the exact spot which takes a few seconds its an annoyance it wouldve been much better if you could just use the thumbstick to change the arc like in any average cover shooter or at least just let you stay behind coveruncharted
when you think about the ps this is probably one of the first series that comes to mind and rightfully so
the uncharted series has a reputation for incredible storytelling and mindblowing setpieces
as a huge fan of the second and third games im sad to say that this first entry does not do the series justice
in fact this might even be one of naughty dogs worst games
heres my reviewstory as nathan drake you and  others travel to an island to find el dorado a large treasure that the spanish and francis drake your ancestor were after
using francis drakes journal youll attempt to find this famous gold statue while surviving the onslaught of men who are also after it
this is a wellwritten story filled with memorable characters both good and evil
here youll find mystery plot twists and everything else that makes a story superbsetting the island youll spend your time on is welldesigned but dont think that since its a jungle setting youll stare at trees the whole time
youll ride a jet ski upriver wander through catacombs and solve indoor puzzles in addition to taking in the sights of the jungle
theres a wealth of visual variety to be had here
with all the effort put into this island you might even begin to think this is a real placegameplay combatat its core uncharted is a shooter
and as much as i enjoy my occasional shooter games i thought this huge aspect of uncharted was an enormous failure
you will gun down hundreds of enemies that the game throws at you by the truckload
its completely outrageous
when there are  waves of enemies in the same area it really shows poor design
granted the enemy ai is admirable
these guys will run to the side of your cover lob grenades at you and move in ways to avoid gunfire
but cover shooting grows terribly old after engaging in your th encounter
you literally cannot go  minutes without facing enemies  of the time
i only wish that were an exaggeration
at least you get a hefty variety of weapons to wreak havoc withpuzzle solvingplatformingcompared to the rest of the game puzzle solving plays a very minimal role
off the top of my head i can remember  large puzzles  of which were basically mimicking what you see from pages in drakes journal
thats right no thought whatsoever
i did though appreciate the incredibly smooth climbing mechanic leaping from ledge to ledge is nice and effortlessobjectives the game is split into  chapters that are easily replayable from the main menu
there is of course your main objective the whole time
this is a linear game with the only thing to do on the side being treasure collecting
i just didnt find any importance in doing so though
the game doesnt give an introduction to treasures or even explain why youre collecting them in the first place
but essentially collecting treasures and performing other tasks earns you medal points used to modify gameplay
you can tweak the game by enabling fast motion slow motion or even select any weapon at any time
again though theres no feeling of significance in treasure hunting
why should i care what the name or appearance of my treasure is
bottom line youll come to this game for its main objective and nothing else treasures are not fun to findoverall its disappointing that a game with such a stellar story has to be marred by an overreliance on gunplay mixed with mindless puzzles
treasure hunting feels pointless so all youll ever want to do is advance the storyline taking in the genuinely interesting scenery as you go
if youve yet to jump into the uncharted series id say go for the later entries or pick this up cautiously knowing that the most youll get out of it is storyi bought this game for my  year old nephew whos really gotten into fishing over the past couple years but usually only gets to fish when they visit grandma and grandpa over the summer
the fishing part itself is designed pretty well
my nephew was catching  largemouth bass within an hour
so it must be fairly simple to pick up
considering the lakes in this game are apparently only filled with large sized fish he might be disappointed when it comes to doing the real thing again next summer
so far weve only been able to fish two of the featured lakes
the others are locked for some reason ive yet to discover
i guess thats how you progress to new levels
some of the controlls could be more intuitive and the way the game loads is a bit confusing even for adults asking about saved games the very first time the disc loads
the graphics are rather poor  definately not up to hd quality
but ill skip further criticism as while i think the only reason this game rates as high as it does is because it has virtually no competition my nephew absolutely loved it
like actual fishing itself you could hardly pull him away from itwas fun for about a half hour then the music and repetitiveness got to me and i returned it within a weeki had high hopes for this game but as it turns out its nothing more than different rooms with hidden objects that you have to find
from a picture there are lots of items hidden on the wall floor etc and you must find each thats on the list to the right and yes some are pretty well hidden
after youve done that for a couple times you assemble a puzzle together put together peices and then you start again doing the same thing over and over again
if you like to waste precious time doing this nonsense then just go right ahead
life is too short for this
theres no free roaming just hidden objects that you have to find from a picture again and againi mistakenly played return to ravenhurst before i played thee first ravenhurst game which is this game
i expected there to be some sort of gamelplay in this game but there wasnt much
all i did was find hidden objects in different rooms and solve puzzles which the puzzles i didnt like much
there was absolutely no exploring of the house or in the game no gameplay
so all there was to do was 
hidden objects to find in a room and 
puzzles but nothing in betweenif you like games that only find hidden objects with no gameplay then this game is fine for you
just not what i preferi really regret buying this game
acme arsenal fails on two levels both as a video game and as a wii gamefirst as a video game acme arsenal is just a generic thirdperson shooter with a looney tunes look
you might as well be playing tomb raider
the game fails to capture the essence of looney tunes humor
instead you fight robots
lots and lots of robots
over and over againit should also be stated that the twoplayer splitscreen mode was a really poor choice by the designers
as other reviewers have noted the separate views for each player make it very easy for players to get separated
furthermore the camera that follows your character is not very smart so with only  of the screen you will frequently find yourself in positions where you cant see the object onto which you need to jumpfinally as a wii game this is utterly uninspired
you twist and shake the controllers to perform attacks but this is not any improvement over mashing button combinations
the movements are not natural or intuitive or funwhat this game should have been was something along the lines of the rayman raving rabbids games
like the old looney tunes cartoons raving rabbids is  or  minutes of crazy laughoutloud funokay i admit i got this game because daffy duck is my favorite looney tune
call me crazy but this game can be fun and challenging but also very aggravating in some parts
i like the touch screen feature but unfortunately some of the minigames or challenges are very annoying and at times unbeatable
i try to have fun with it but sometimes it just gets annoying and i turn it off or switch to an easier game
overall it is a good game for any daffy duck fan to own but whoever is able to complete the game i give kudos to ya
its impossible for melooney tunes is perhaps the most beloved and famous cartoon in history
the pure comedy of it makes it so lovable and its natural to expect that like most other cartoons and movies it would be made into video games
duck amuck is one such game and its based on one of the funniest episodes of looney tunes where daffy is being tortured and humiliated by an unseen animator
in duck amuck you take the role of that animator but unfortunately you dont feel like youre in that position at all resulting in a game that is no more than a missed opportunityall of the potentially creative moments in duck amuck take place with daffy standing in front of a blank backdrop similar to the looney tunes episode and this is where you will spend your time between minigames
you can poke daffy slice him in half tear the background or pick him up
unfortunately thats the extent of this scene
you would think there would be some user input as far as what you can do to daffy but there is none
you are limited to the few things the game offers and thats it
this makes duck amuck feel like a totally wasted opportunity to make a great episode into a fun game leaving you not even feeling like youre the animatorpoking daffy tearing the background or just waiting around triggers events
you are then shown a cutscene involving daffy doing something revolving around the world created around him and then you play a minigame
unfortunately there are very few laughs to be had by watching these clips as they arent very funny at all
daffys voice is just as it was in the cartoons though so its at the very least slightly nostalgiceven if you do enjoy the little cartoons though you have to play through the minigame that follows and trust me when i say you wont really want to do that
these involve such actions as blowing out candles passing out cards or if youre lucky slicing vegetables
a few of these games have a decent premise such as making the screen cave in on daffy but none of them are fun or amusing because they are uninteresting way too simple and very easy
none of these games are worth replaying or playing for the first time for that matterthe goal of duck amuck is to win these minigames which makes daffys angry meter go up and when its full youve beaten the game
this takes a half hour at most and then you see the credits roll and say ok thats it
but wait theres more
you can always play the longer versions of the minigames or look for the secret character coins hidden throughout the minigames
but i dont see why you would want to do that because the minigames are so dull to begin with and the character coins are too hard to find
well there goes any potential value duck amuck may have hadgraphically duck amuck is at least true to itself
the visuals definitely look like looney tunes and they appear fairly decent
unfortunately the graphics dont look nearly as sharp as you would expect in fact theyre just a tad choppy
on top of that the few character animations in the game arent very interesting to watch which goes even further to push the games very uninteresting naturesound is easily duck amucks strongest point but even that isnt without its problems
daffys voice is just as it was in the cartoon which is really fantastic
the voice at least is mildly entertaining even if there arent any good lines
unfortunately the sound quality is pretty poor resulting in everything sounding just a little fuzzy
the other sound effects are fine but they definitely dont make the game more interestingthat said duck amuck is nothing short of a missed opportunity
the people who made this game were given the chance to make an awesome creative and entertaining game but ultimately there is little success
the minigames are boring torturing daffy isnt very fun and there is very little content to boot
even the most avid of looney tunes fans will be disappointed by this major flop because you dont even feel like the animator youre supposed to be playing as
positive daffy duck voice acting is goodnegative too many limitations make it a wasted opportunity very few bright moments minigames are simple easy and uninteresting very little contentlast word duck amucks dull minigames and lack of creativity make it a wasted opportunity that could have been so much more
even the most avid of looney tunes fans are better off forgetting about this gameim only  years old and to the video game world i must be a senior citizen at this point
this is just a fair warning to those looking for a cool ds gamenow i was so happy to see a sidescrolling action game for the ds especially contra
as d games tend to get me a little frustrated but any d game out there has not made me nearly as frustrated as this game made me with the exception of metroid prime for gamecube
it is unbelievably painstakingly difficult even on easy
i sometimes wonder who these people are who can actually sit down and complete a game like this while having a good time
kudos to you talented gamers but i guess shame on me for being an average gamer  and not only is this game darn near impossible if you want to save and play it later you end up having to use  of your very precious continues  what were the developers thinking
hmmmm how can we seriously irritate the gamer even more so  i have an idea
lets punish them for not sitting through the entire game from start to finish
but hey  maybe its just me  im just glad they made cheat codes for this one the same code as for the nes also
otherwise i would have been very upset with this purchasegood luck with this game its a tough onethis is just an additional content for the previously released metal gear solid portable opsone of the worst mgs games i ever came across and im a big mgs fan been playing them since the ps originalits lame nothing original you lose your weapons every stagedespite the fact that lara croft can rile up any young male gamer tomb raider really isnt that impressive
it is fun in the short term but after a few levels and several hours the creative transforms into the boring
how many traps can you disarm
how many walls can you scale
how many savage beasts can you killthere are a lot of actionshooter fans out there so maybe this game will be popular with that crowd
if you want some interesting gameplay but dont hunger for story richness this will do
even the most creative games will get repetitive if its the same type of gameplay scenery and sounds dont guarantee prolonged interestgraphics excellent
you wont be disappointed by the visuals and effectssound excellent
you wont be disappointed by the realistic environmental audiomechanics fair
the controls are awkward and the rotating camera can be disorienting and distractinggameplay poor
no real story to the game  at least not one big enough to sink your teeth into
no incentive to replay the game
feels kind of adhocive had two variations on this stick
doa stick ex theyre functional enough
the problem is that theyre not built to last longer than  months under regular use
the buttons crapped out on both sticks
prior to that the mic ports took to shooting static at the people i was playing online
very annoyingi wouldnt recommend buying one of the lower grade arcade sticks at all if youre thinking of trying one out
if you do find you like using a stick this isnt a product youll be able to keep using for long
for the money i spent on the two sticks ibought i couldve simply picked up a solid hrap or a madcatz tournament edition stick which wouldnt need to be completely replaced since you can just buy and swap out buttons on those no problemfor  right now you can get a hori soul calibur v stick that uses full sanwa parts
same parts used in japanese arcade machines
a stick that also has support for analog modes gives you access to all the pads buttons has rapid fire etcthese sticks really werent worth  when they came out
theyre certainly not worth  nowi did not like this game very much and i was really hoping for so much morei found it very hard to handle the controller with the game and it just didnt sync right
i had trouble getting enough power to get the ball over the net and couldnt aim the ball to where i wanted it to goi gave up and traded it inonly to find i couldnt finish the tutorial
its pretty embarrassing to realize youve spent good money on a game youll never playi bought this game for  on amazon looking for a more improved wii sports baseball game and i believed that i hit gold
it has fantastic detail from the ball parks to some fun play by play
the biggest issue is that the wii remote alone can only be used in exibition and home run modes
other than that you need to use the nunchuk for the other game modes
i dont get the point of this
the wii is supposed to be the game system that takes advantage of sensor gameplay but this is nothing of the sort
i dont get why the use of the wii remote isnt standard while including the nunchuk and old game cube controller is an option
the nunchuck and wii controller button use to play is just awkward and even worse boring
i dont want to play this when i have better wii remote sensor games to play mario baseball mario kart and wii sports
i also currently own mlb the show for ps so i dont need another handheld controller game hence why i like swinging the wii remote to bat and pitch and that is the only reason i buy wii sports games
this is a fantastic concept but why not allow for me to enjoy the game with simplified controls that i can use on say mario baseball
ive always said that a game needs to be made that is exactly like wii sports baseball but with game modes that mlb the show has
add in shaking the remote to run and throw and being able to control the baserunners with the directional buttons
unfortunately power pros misses the mark and i can say that if you want a simple wii remote game this is so close but not near perfectage of conan aoc had my expectations rather high
first of all i am not a hardened mmorpg player but someone who enjoys a variety of games
at first aoc looked great and sounded like a fresh take on the mmorpg genre
before i go farther my pc is a dedicated gaming rig that should handle anything thrown at it so my pc wasnt at faultprosa less cartoonlike mmorpg
nice environments
an actual combat system that requires timing and attention
large variety of classes to play
simple interface to change instances to play with your friends
pretty good voice acting and musicconsfirst thing i noticed when i registered is that they decided not to give out he free day pass for one friend
although they advertised it they decided not to provide it
the single player portion has a good story but no real roleplaying decisions involved
it is pretty simple and relatively mindless after a while you just skip all dialog because it doesnt help
after you cook of all of the water it is just boils down to another basic hoarding game where all you do is go get something and comeback
the combat system although different becomes boring after doing the same thing a thousand times
lack of game moderators to fix problems like being stuck in scenery is really irritating
for a monthly fee they should at least be able to rig a script to get a player unstuck if you arent even going to moderate the game
very buggy game one day i had to restart the game several times due to server problems
this would not be so bad if it was just on occasion but it plagues everyone i game withconclusionoverall the game just isnt fun
i really wanted to enjoy the game but it isnt worth the initial price or the monthly fee or the time lostaoc  failthe hype on this game was far better then the game itself this is one of those games where a small hard core love it  and the rest of us just say bleh  it sorta feels like a conan world  you will all look the same  you have very little versatality in what you look like at various levels  everyone wears a dress type armor or robe  and every level advance has its own look of weapon and armor  so if your  your gonna look just like every other  level player in the game quests are meh and dull  it is sorta fun to explore a bit but even that gets tedious and impossible as some mob placement will not let you get past points unless you can slay them i would say give the game a try but do not invest in the collector its really hard to get a bad review from me but there are so many things wrong with this effort from kconsill only talk about  problem so this isnt a book of a review
a lot of the other problems in the game follow this same formula
during legacy play you practice things such as shooting rebounding post defense etc to develope your players
this should have been fun but k dropped the ball here
i have now tried the point shot drill many times maybe  and still havent passed it once
that might be besides the fact but there are good reasons it is so difficult and it isnt my skills
the camera pans in everytime you shoot so you cant see your player anymore
the player will also move sometimes a lot after they shoot and you will have to wait for the camera to pan back wait for the rebounder to get you the ball back takes  seconds which is an eternity set yourself making sure you are in the circle they want you to shoot from then you can shoot and hope you remain in the circle during your shot
this is a problem folks
in shooting drills it is very important to flow and how did k expect us to flow when there is so damn much going on at once before during and after each shot
it kills the fun and makes the game more of a hassle than entertainment
the menus are frustrating as well
for instance they make you hit ok sometimes when ok is the only option
exit is another one they like to make you take time to press
i hope you follow what i mean here
if you only have  option why do they make you think about it
haha
geezprosthe actual gameplay during games is great
fun
the graphix arent anything new but good
there are plenty of teams and conferences to choose from so chances are your favorite team is in the game go xavier
some of the other drills are fun even if there are those few that will have you more angry than anythingbottomline this game is great if you only focus on actually playing the actual games but there is totally too much frustration going on that its hard to want to turn the game on in the first place
i would recommend trying eas college basketball game first
i personally havent played it yet but this game by k isnt what youre probably looking for
youd have better luck trying the other gameureal  is pretty much dull
it falls so short to other shootersplus all the mic problems that is the main flaw of this game
worth renting but not buyingunreal the fast pased fps is the king off all frag filled game
in their third outing epic has thrown in everything and the kitchen sinkfast paced checkbig guns checkvehicles checkfun close but nothe games blow by and while the vehicles player models and envrioments are all nice to look at the fun factors simply is lacking
after a few games youll get the idea and simply want to turn it off
theres no sense of accmplishment when you score a kill or when you achive something in an objective gamei highly suggest renting the game first to see if you like it but i wouldnt just flat out pay for iti realize that i am in the minority here but i really didnt enjoy this nd game
on the positive side the plot moves along the graphics are great and it is more challenging than most of the last releases
however many of the puzzles are just not that logical and can be very tedious
this is the first nancy drew game that i have had to consistently resort to cheat sites to get through even on junior detective
normally i can complete the whole mystery with only one to two hintsit seems like her is trying to respond to customer comments and create longer more challenging games
some of the puzzles in this particular game do that very well
other parts however really miss the mark
if you are a fan of other nd games youll probably enjoy this one too
if you havent played any other games in the nancy drew series this is not a good choice to start withsearching for glass eyeballs was not the highest point in the game
the games were just challenging enough that they frustrate you but easy enough that you dont spend a super long time on them nancy drew fans think of the spinning rooms in blackmoor manor
eek
the start was enough to send my little sister running off screaming
it is a creepier one but not too too creepy
the storyline is sort of slow and the culprit was soooo predictable
i wont ruin it for you who want to buy it but stillthis game was very frustrating and very fun
i wouldnt recommend this one as it is a tad bit more annoying than it is satisfyingthis game made me dizzy from the get go
i never knew which room i was in
i had to look up cheats on occasion which defeats the purpose of any gamei love to play the nancy drew games but this game was a little wayoutthere for me
the voodoo was disturbing and this game seemed to be centered all around it
i wouldnt recommend this game for young children at all i played it first and sent the kids out when i played this one
and it is hard to see the game other than when its played a dark room which was annoying because i dont want my computer on at night
the only fun part for me was reading the goofy names in the cemetery record book
the box looks interesting the game is not
i didnt enjoy this game as much as i have enjoyed past and later nancy drew games
we only played it once or twice and now it sits on a shelffirst off we have loved all the other nancy drews we have played
this game seemed intentionally created darkly as if theyre trying to steer us as an audience that way
waaaay too many eyeballs
and creepiness for me and my  year old
i did and didnt like the new format for your items
i like the new list of suspects but i liked the to look at my viewable items and portable items separately as in past games
nancy seemed to talk less and give clues less this game than usual
sorry but sometimes its just helpful for you to know what your doing or doing wrong
it was fun to trade places with bess
still we stand by this ratingto be fair this probality is a good game i just found it hard to play 
i couldnt finish itthe game is good the fighting style has never been better
the problem is i have no one to fight but  me myself and i or if i go stalk a king of fighters enthusiast since there are so many fighters out now days its difficult without online play to find people good in your fighting game of choice and playing the computer gets borring real fast but you already knew that
dont buy fighting games unless you got a bunch of buddies playing the same one or its online thats why im having a blast playing online foes in mortal kombat ds even though technically this game is way superiori simply cannot believe this game is from codemasters and that it is a ps title
codemasters is known for taking great care to craft quality titles and i cant imagine what happened with this one its a riddle
and the ps has so much power and potential there really is no excuse for such a terrible waste of time and money
this game is simply awful
the graphics are ps quality at best in fact i can think of several ps shooters that look better play better sound better and are just a lot more fun than this garbage
killzone and black for example
the controls are not very intuitive eg
r is the trigger button and r is the alt fire button permanently and only one or two button functions can be changed
plus the zoomaim function is toggle only and cannot be changed to hold mode
i would give this game one star except the story is pretty original that part they got right but even then the execution is tragic
 starsthis game had a promising premise with a reinvention of the events of world war  unfortunatly the game itself could not match its premise
the game is falty in many many ways
the gameplay is hindered by tons of glitches
just walking in this game is difficult
the game loads slowly and you are constantly being straifed by the game itself as it loads the environment
the camera angle shakes when you walk down stairs also the iron sites are the bulkiest i have ever seen in a fps
they are basically unusable
this means that the gunplay is terrible
you are constantly just using crosshairs
also picking up ammo is a problem as you have to look at the gun on the ground as you walk over it in order to pick it upthe story is not well developed either
you only find out what is going on in a mission when you actually do it
they give you no background on the mission
you constantly feel like you are left in the dark
the graphics are decent for when the game came out theyre not too flashy but they are probably the best part of this failure of a game
the ending leaves you with a sense of annoyance as it really doesnt have a good conclusion
you never even hear your character talk in the game he just listens to everyone else
the campaign is rather difficult at times not because of fair challange it is only because the game appears to glitch through walls and spawn behind you
there isnt even a good melee system as you have to wait until a fist pops up before you can hit the enemy
sometimes it doesnt even come up and the enemy shoots you to death
the game has the feel of a medal of honor game the only differance is that medal of honor has decent controls
this game has some of the worst controls in a game that i have ever played
it does have alot of action but there are alot of frustrating moments that plague that action
i paid ten bucks for this game and im still angry at the low level of development that was involvedbe wary buyers
this case could damage your ds
my ds was permanently marked by the extra ds stylus secured in its designed place in this product while inside this case
fortunately i noticed it in time and could rub out the mark so its hardly noticeableheres the whole story
i read on other buyers reviews on amazon that their dses were being scratched by the extra ds games they kept inside this case
apparently there isnt enough space between the extra game pockets and the ds itself so that any extra games in the case rub against each other when this case is closed causing abrasion and scratching on the ds
i only wanted this case for my ds not the extra game pockets and had heard nothing about similar problems with the extra stylus
so i tried it out with the extra stylus in its pocket in the case
i noticed abrasion marks in the shape and area of the extra stylus within a week and promptly removed it
the case works fine with no scratching without games or extra stylus in the pockets
so be prepared to not use any of the pockets for games and the extra stylus in this case unless you dont mind scratching your dshowever if you dont use the game and stylus pockets in the case or dont mind scratching your ds then this case is pretty nice
the good part about this case is that it is very hard and thick making it very durable
this could protect your ds from a heavy falling object
one drawback of this durability is that it weighs so much
it feels like it weighs about as much as the ds itself
this could be troublesome for children
one other small benefit is that it has a hole to insert a strap to carry the case from the case itself however does not come with such a strap
one drawback to this is that the hole is a liability to the ds inside making it vulnerable to possible spilled liquids because of its position close to the bottom of the casethe goodi got this case because it was cheap after all why waste the money right
it holds as you can see six nds game cartridges and your nds itself plus one stylusthe badthis travel case is actually quite heavy while the outer shell is hard the inside rubber is lose and easily bent
this case is actually quite large too id recommend a travel case either smaller or a general larger casethe ugly no im not kiddingprepare for scratches on your system and pinched fingers
there is nothing between your games and ds so just closing the case causes them to rub due to it being so compact and if you try to put something between them such as a piece of cloth it will be very hard to closei for one found my fingers getting pinched badly over and over
it sounds like a case of children being clumsy right
well the fault is actually in the poor design the case has a small half circle hallow on the hinge part my guess would be to enable you to put your finger in the opening to remove the ds when the case is open but that little hole can quite easily catch on finger pads no matter how careful one might be
eg my case was very stiff so i had to have fingers behind and thumb on the button to open
i finally got tired of bruised fingers and fighting to add extra protection and replaced my casethis is one of those could of been great games
the gameplay suffers from unimportant facts being spewed out much too often
and as usual the storyline ending goes nowhere
save your money and dont buy this game
frequent program crashes even with most up to date patch and drivers
use your stimulus check for gasoline insteadbuggy impossible pathfinding and the occasional asinine puzzle will make sure to ruin your experience like culpa innata writers did to me
too bad because there was a n overall intriguing story behind this clunker of an adventure game
the misses are just unforgivable
avoiddoesnt hold a charge wait for ever to get a controller charged would not recommend this product to any onethis charger does not charge well it keeps dieing and i try to charge my remotes but it just doesnt work welli have the feeling i could play this game for the next five years and never finish
i dont know why i bought it because i didnt much like morrowind
i like this one better but am already bored and ready to quit
in truth if one must play a first person game this is probably the one to play but it bores me to deathi enjoyed the lovecratian themes within the story and thought the voice acting of watson and holmes were great indeed but as previous reviewers have commented the game requires you travel such a narrow path that its downright distracting even maddening at times
pixel hunting ive heard some call it i enjoy puzzle games but i dont enjoy having to figure out how to work the game as whole as a puzzle
others in this set have commented on this lacking better than meit wasnt as fightening or offputting as i thought it may be
it has an m rating which is a borderline call in my opinion
drop a few of the dead bodies and it could be a childrens game graphicallyoverall the game was not that difficult and had a great nineteenth century atmosphere
the creepy lovecraft themed underworld that the duo uncover is really what compelled me to continue and finish the game
my dissatisfaction with the game is with the suffocatingly linear approach throughout the entire game i even had to start over once because i needed an item from a previous chapter and had saved over it  youd think developers and programmers would be smarter than this by nowwasnt happy with this purchase because it didnt fit my  gamethis is all i need to say thank you not a good experienceall was taken care of
i feel that it should have stated it wouldnt fit nintendo ds litewell it works and if your on a budget or just a cheap skate go ahead and buy this but the fitting is a little too tight and by that i mean you have to really force it into the slot
but like i said it does work i just will not buy aftermarket chargers anymore unless i am out of all other optionsthis is a really fun game to play
it has a learning curve for the cover system
i cant believe that my game saves disappeared twice
the first time i was close to the beginning so it didnt bother me much but the second time i was very far into the game
i even installed the patch  im not going to play through this game again until it is fixed
wait for a while to buy this game
many people are posting about this problem
i dont think the game saves to your hard drive
you cant backup or download game saves
it is saved on a website using some stupid microsoft online crapthis is a third person shooter you play the game looking over somebodysshoulder as you do when watching a movie
you are not in the moviegame developers dont seem to get it
most all of the great shootergames have been first person
are third person games cheaper to makeshame on the developers and amazon for not letting us knowduck fire fire fire game over
reload checkpoint and wait one minute run duck fire fire opps reload checkpoint and wait some more
run run run duck fire reloadwhile this is a fun game for the most part the checkpoints are few and far between
unless youve mastered the game you spend almost an equal amount of time playing as you do for the game to reload
this is on the medium level and from someone who is a pretty good game player
now if you play it extra careful by frequently ducking and not taking too many risks then youll stay alive longer and have less restores
for someone who likes to jump out in the middle and kick butt youre going to be doing a lot of dying which i guess is the point of this kind of game but still it would be nice if you could save it at anytime or have an option to pick the checkpoint system or not
this checkpoint system ruins the game if you ask me
one frustrating point is the level where you defend a base after  minutes of fighting a hole opens up and three boomers start attacking
one hit from them and youre dead with no second chances
some of these levels take wayyy too long to get through as a result
due to the frustration and boredom of repeating everything again and again on some of these difficult levels i have to take a break and play the game later
it shouldnt feel like work to play a gamegears of war is a game that could have been greatbut fell far shorti hope you like staring at a black white and gray screen for hours at a time because that is about the only colors you are going to see throughout the whole game
ever play a first person shooter before
nothing new here
i am not going into the minutiae like some people do
here is the whole picture synopsisthis game offers something different in the way of weapons and the movements of your character
you do and dont get the typical machine gun
yes it is a machine gun but it feels and sounds solid and futuristic when playing this game
your movements are interesting
you can cling to duck behind and walk along walls for cover like you have always wanted to
peek out shoot around the corner then duck back behind itsadly that is the whole scheme of the gamepeek shoot and duck
wash rinse repeat
thankfully the enemy will try to flank you run right up to you and throw grenades at you
that definitely keeps it excitingtell you more about the grenades
ok they are cool looking they are powerful and the throwing system is unique
and it is also very disappointing
you hold your mouse  button to create a throw path for the grenade to follow
when ready you click the mouse  button to throw it and boom
this works great when you are on level ground
in many cases the camera angles for the throwing system completely prevent you from seeing where you are throwing the grenade
effectively neutralizing your aim
also you can only carry 
yes a measly  grenadeswhich brings us to ammo
there are no health power ups or armor power ups to go hunting for
you automatically regenerate these when you are not being shot
awesome
ammo is abundant and you can pick up your dead enemies weapons allowing you to switch weapons and stock ammo to your hearts content
again  awesomethe biggest suck factors of this game are as follows video is excellent but the colors are only gray black and whitegame play is fast and fun but it gets repetitiveno save system
checkpointsyuck
the game is entirely scripted so you know when the enemy is coming every timewhen you die you are forced to go through some of the same cut scenes over and over
some can be skipped others cannot
it feels like they ported it from the xbox  instead of making a solid version developed specifically for the pcoverall it was ok not bad not great
i played a friends copy so luckily i did not have to actually pay for it
i definitely dont think it is worth 
maybe 
no way would i pay morei realize gears of war is the darling of the gaming industry and theres some great reasons why the xbox version of gears of war deserves that acclaim
for the pc however the customer truly gets the shaft
most of the problems with gears of war for the pc have been a complete showstopper for many many users out there
i put the game away for a year
when i reinstalled it last weekend it was because i had hoped the last round of patches would make things better
it amazes me that here we are years later and still this game is plagued with problemswhat problems installation may take  hours or more
something in the system signs point to drm throttles back installation of the product
i have no idea why it does this but ive witnessed it on more than one machine
this same issue may be what causes the game to take  minutes to launch every time i go to run it after installtion the game will not be able to launch without patching
it will accuse you of having tampered with the code and tell you to reinstall the game
dont bother reinstalling because that wont change anything
instead you have to patch the game
there was a server certificate issue that epicmicrosoft fixed after it broke a lot of users installations
the workaround involved moving your pcs calendar to a datetime before the problem which by the way can cause other bad things to happen with other programs
i ended up rolling my clock back patching then rolling forward and rebooting to properly get the job done and speaking of patchesthe patcher will often crash
thankfully it finishes the job before dropping dead the last patch crash i witnessed appears to be the patcher attempting and failing to launch the game for you the windows live account creates problems of its own first it needs to be updated ingame having the latest version of games for windows live on your machine will not do because gears of war cannot figure that out it has its own installation of the program second you cannot log into games for windows live outside of gears of war and expect gears of war to run it wont understand this and it will prevent you from accessing content without explaining why
leave the game log out of games for windows live close games for windows live and relaunch the game third other games for windows live titles that cant detect a separate install of games for windows livelike halo really dont like it when you bounce from one games for windows live game to another
updating games for windows live in one game doesnt update it in another
you should probably know that after you agree to letting the game update games for windows live it will then tell you that it may decide to restart your computer
i wish i could know that ahead of time before i agree to a reboot i cant controlwhy does games for windows live matter
for the same reasons that i have now played gears of war twothirds of the way through about  times your saved games are dependent on games for windows live your saved games will randomly disappear or become corrupted and you have to start the game over you definitely cannot access your saved games if you havent logged into games for windows live and you may also find that your saved games wont transfer from one machine to another ive had a message that my saved games do not exist on this machines hard drive if youre buying gears of war for its multiplayer capability you should know that you will not be able to access the full benefits of multiplayer without a paid live subscription you will otherwise get limited features and no achievementsgraphically gears of war offers an extremely wellrendered experience provided you have some hefty hardware for it
i run the game on a dualcore amd  machine with gb of ram and dual gts cards in sli
i need to throttle the settings back to mediumlow for everything and i still have tearing problems and framerate drops with vsync enabledthe concept of gears of war is relatively simple and it forces you to change your thinking from runandgun to duckandcover everything you do requires you to hide behind cover move to other cover and blast the living hell out of anything that gets in your way
blood fountains bullets fly by the thousands the enemies die splattingly and on the ground camera angles put you in the middle of the action
there are decision paths along the way that provide slightly different experiences depending which direction you choose
there is some small amount of strategy close the hole in the ground lure the monster out into the open etc
everything is tied together into a larger story that is told through cinematics
sadly most of these gorgeous cinematics contain little dialog or plot development beyond military grunts sniping at each other and hints that no one else really likes your characterif you want to take a chance that youll be one of the lucky few who have a minimum of problems gears of war for the pc may offer you the same experience enjoyed by the xbox crowd
i still wouldnt recommend paying full price for the pc version if only because of the many headaches youll most likely be in forthis wheel has a wonderful aesthetic and clamping mechanism and thats where it all endsonce this pretty wheel is clamped to yourahhh whatever its clamped to be prepared for an experience like no other including driving because its not at all like drivingthis force feedback wheel simply fails in all games it generates force that makes the wheel harder to turn but thats all
no vibration no rumble no realistic feel of the roaddirtgravelsandwaterair beneath your tiresi compare this to my decades of drivingracing experience and also the best wheel ever developed for a game the atari hard drivin coinop
that wheel was the first ever produced for gaming back in  and it was brilliant you could tell through precise feel exactly what kind of surface your tires were on sand dirt asphalt gravel and most importantly air and when your wheels touched down at an odd angle that wheel would practically get yanked out of your hand with smooth direct and precise pressurethe xbox  wheel by comparison is like driving with boxing gloves on
the fact that there is some sensation of force will no doubt thrill those that have never taken hold of a good wheel before so beware  year olds that love this wheel
they have no clue what they are talking aboutsome of the blame must go onto the game developers but after trying dozens of auto racing games in all weather conditions few seem to be able to do anything interesting with this wheel no vibrations at all
you should be able to feel your engine but no
you should be able to feel your tires leave the ground but no you should be able to feel the pounding when you land the squireely feel of wheels starting to brake loose and chatter at extremes of conditions you should feel a distinct resistance to standard turn inputs and a relaxation of the wheel force when it begins to loose tractionall experiences with this wheel have been very disappointingpainkiller was not exactly breaking new ground with its release in  yet it was a fast fps with a demonic theme and innovative weaponry that offered tons of fun
its first expansion battle out of hell did not veer far offthe same can be said up to a point for painkiller overdose although developed by a different team than the one that gave us the original and the first expansionit is a standalone expansion with most of the virtues and all the faults of the original painkiller
excellent sound especially if equipped with  or  speakers you will be jumping to look over your shoulder all the time quite good graphics yet not at par with the latest releases a refreshed set of weapons and a really fast paceon the other hand it will get tedious pretty fast as the story is paper thin and the level design is adequate yet with little variations
how many versions of hellrooms can you stomachso after having tried all your weapons from the goodol veggie cube and rocket launcher to the new demonic laser and even gave their alternative firing mode a go well there is not much new to see thererecommended only to the fans of the series  everybody else i would advise starting with the originalthe name on the box says painkiller overdoseit looks more like serious sam
it sounds more like serious sam
it plays more like serious sam
what the he happenedclunky game play boring sound track and stupid humor
yes serious sam has hijacked this game and it aint goodthe first  versions of painkiller rocked
this version should be thrown on the rocks
save your moneythis game is too complicated
i purchased fire pro based on glowing internet reviews only to be disappointed with the maddeningly unintuitive character creation interface and ingame controls
i would skip this game unless youre already a fan of the seriesas the title states this is a game you can literally make your own
create anyone
create any arena
create any ring
the only thing that limits the game in this regard is your own creativitybeyond thatthe automatic grappling system can take some getting used to for a smackdownsvrwwe title fan but i guess it has a unique feel to it
my gripes are not with the system itself its the implementation
 is designated as your weaker movesx is designated as your intermediateo is designated as your power
beyond that x does the majority of the finishers  although i swear ive done some by accident in the o category of moves
as i stated i have a gripe here and its that for a game that advertises having so many moves why are two moves in each category the same
was this really necessary
either way you have more moves at your disposal than any svr game created from  and the recent wwe but i have to say i enjoy my grappling freedom a lot more in hctp svr and svr
the striking also takes a bit of getting used to in order to time it just right but after a match or two youll have little or no issue landing your kicks and punchesi didnt really care much for the entrances personally although this may fall under something fire pro isnt typically that concerned with  i have no experience with the previous titles in the series from the other consoles so i dont claim to know if this is normal for their them
either way i usually just skip them entirely in this gamed sprites actually work well in this game
initially i had my doubts just by watching the videos on youtube and stuff before purchasing the game but the models really do look great  and its very easy to find equally great looking game saves if you do a google search
i currently have one with the entire wwe  roster along with legends from the past  decades
the ability to have so many caws is nice in this regard since you dont have to pick and choose who to keep on your memory card
the fact a caw looks just as good as a stock wrestler is a nice plusall in all i just didnt find myself enjoying this game a whole lot
ive actually gone back and revisited it a few times thinking i just didnt give it enough of a chance since it looks like im in the minority for the most part on how i feel about itmy personal opinion  if you want a complete wrestling game you would be better off purchasing hctp or svr
however if you find that gameplay a bit too fastunrealistic pick up svr
beyond that the other wwe titles take far too many moves away from the player and just become too repetitiveboring very fast
either of those  titles give the player  front grapples rear grapples high ground grapples low ground grapples  groggy against the ropes attack  corner low grapples  corner high grapples  or 
top rope attacks  strikes  irish whip attacks a finisher some have  and  weapon attacks plus  weapon finisher
i dont know the official math for how many moves fpr gives each character at any given point
maybe its more
maybe its not
but from a move standpoint alone along with the d graphics authentic entrances match commentary annoying at times but you can disable if you wish and the better grappling system my opinion  these  titles feature the best grappling system in wrestling game history it went to hell after svr i really cant find something wrong with these couple gamesill retain fpr in my collection and most likely boot it up from time to time but it will always be behind the games i mentioned above in my like list
theres nothing awful about the game its just not my cup of tea when it comes to what i believe a wrestling game should bei thought this would be a good headset but im a cod player and then headset just goes blank on every loud explosionnot a good headset for codheres where it fails for me the simple audio hook up of the transmitter to the xbox  console does not work with hdmi only connections
to make a long story shortmy  plasma is built into a home theater wall
the xbox is hardwired to it via hdmi
i would think this is very common since hdmi is the best possible quality and the fewest cables
in order to make this puppy work i have to now use the analog xbox cable octopus and put that to my tv or hardwire the x transmitter via my wall to my tv out
thats just silly and poorly thought out
the issue here is that youre running unnecessary cables for just this headset the sound comes with lots of white noise  hiss
certainly not fit for  headphonesyou have to control this with multiple
dials on different components there is absolutely no spatial  surround effect
ie
you play cod and have no idea if someone is coming from behind
for  no  i guess i should have read the description better instead of assuming it but again for that kinda money it should be includedsorry used to love tb soundcards but this is not up to snuff
rave reviews are coming from lack of viable alternatives
we need more entrants in this market spacenot sure how this made it as best in classthe good you can play as the predator all the series trademarks are herethe bad but done badly stupid ai bland and boring graphics levels repetitive snore inducing combati had high expectations for this game and they were quickly brought down
once you start playing youll notice the game feels a lot like star wars battlefront because it was made by the same people
the game sports subpar graphics that dont do the psp justice
avp has an almost nonexistent story with no voices just text at the beginning of each missionthe combat is simple and boring with the mashing of the square button or using your special weapons with circle
you can use everything from predators spear to shoulder cannon to his throwing disc
every level is laid out the same and is boring and bland
each mission has you destroying predator technology or killing alien huskssome missions even throw in broken stealth by having you turn on your cloak and running past the braindead humans
while avp may entertain you for a short time its nothing special or worth really checking outthe idea of playing a psp on a flat screen sounded pretty cool so i bought this to experience the awesome feeling
however i saw people complaining a little about how the cables really work so i didnt get my hopes up
sure enough people were right
the screen is small unless you adjust your tv settings so that isnt too much of a problem
however the color is complete crap
i dont know how the color is on other peoples tvs but on mine the games colors are all washed and yellowish looking
color is one of the most important parts of detail on a video game so that really turned me off
other than the bad color and choppy looking screen this isnt that much of a bad buy but i still think you will have more fun just playing a game with the psp by itself
this was a good idea but sony just didnt seem to get it down which is a shame because this would of rocked if it was done wellbuy it if you want but i say you should just pass and play with just your pspthis cord is cool if you psp screen is cracked or if you want to watch movies
thats about it
the games look horriblebut the movies are decent
the games center themselves in the middle of the screen which gets annoyinmg after some time
also the colors look saturated and blurry for the psp home console screen and for playing games
its just not worth buying in my opinion unless you plan to use it as a dvd player and watch moviesi bought this product once and tried it on my old big screen tv and couldnt get anything to display
soon i realized that it was because i did not have component cable out or in as it was an older set
ok fine my fault should have read into it a little more
so i returned them and got a refund no problemi got a brand new toshiba hi def for xmas and so i re bought the cables and tried hooking them up
i got everything hooked up properly but first off there were almost no instructions packaged with the cable on how to make it work but even once i learned you must hold down the screen light button on the psp it still did not work
the screen went black and i could hear the music on the tv but no picture
i played around with it for awhile but the most i could get was some distorted white lines at the bottom of the screeni dont know what the problem could be but i might have a clue if there were anything remotely helpful packaged with the product
from what i have read in reviews and online the cable should work just fine with a  model and i know the new tv i have now can support component
i guess it could be a defective cable but its just not worth it to me to return it again
i just think its kind of a crappy product and from what ive read even if i get it working it wont be worth doing
what a shamenow i think i will just go ahead and spring for the ps and play that way
no big deal im not angry or crazy over it but it is a pretty lousy buy
i just cant recommend it as it apparently has some incredibly specific needs which i have failed to meet  out of  times
hey and it was only because i was a dummy one of those timesme pasoacute que compreacute este accesorio para jugar con el psp en el tv y resultoacute ser que en el modo juego el tv debe recibir sentildeal entrelazada cosa que mi modelo de tv no hace asiacute que soacutelo puedo acceder al menuacute principal y no al juego en siacute porque no me lo permiteunlike other heroes of might and magic games ive played heroes v was only enjoyable when i played against my brother
this particular expansion pack did add some extra abilities and new creatures but in general i dont believe they improved the gaming experience that muchi would not recommend a current owner of heroes v buy this gamei bought this cable in hopes of playing and recording a game for a lp lets playi was wrong
theres a message when you try to play the game that says you need either a componet for hdtvs and so on or a dterminal av cable
basicly in order to play or record videos youll need the componet cables in order to play games from your psp to either a pc or hdtvrevised editok i may have been a little harsh on this product so im going to revise my review a little
this cable dose work well with the psp but all you can use it on is to watch videos you can save videos to the psp and then in turn play it on the tv
it will also play umd disk too you can play music and view photos and thats about it
inorder to play games psp disk games you still need the componet cable or a dterminal av cable dterminal cable is for japan only i think
so it dose work well with the psp but it just wasnt what i was expectingits a fun gimmick for about  minutes but then wears thin
one of the wii fit activities was jogging in place with the controller in your pocket not even using the balance board as you watch the bland scenery ugly graphics and annoying miis run with you
another was step aerobics
an actual step dvd program would be more fun then this robotic and slowpaced step on step off step on step right crap
graphics were bland and games werent really that innovative in my opinioni feel this is a fun little toy more or less an expensive scale but overall just another shortlived peripheral for the wii unless they can find some actual fun and innovative uses for it
how many peripherals until weve had enough
anyone else tired of those miis yet i know i amwhile the game is fun its no replacement for a real workout
i found the time between exercises painfully slow and when you exclude all the talking and prep work and abutton mashing you only get about  minutes of work out of a  minute workout
i got the my fitness coach and its much more intense than the wii fit
the balance board is basically a gimmickafter  months of light use on the wii fit i sold mine on ebay for just about what i paid wasnt in the mood to price gouge
i was disappointed with it and i still dont understand all the hype
its just not that much funwii fit like all nintendo wii and ds products is polished and immaculately presented
its very approachable and friendly
the balance board is a tremendous piece of kit  rock solid and absolutely excellent at what its supposed to doas a product dedicated to fitness though its pretty lacking
now dont get me wrong  it is far better than doing nothing what i am used to doing and actually has some nice perks to keep you going like score tracking and an unlock mechanic
but it doesnt let you customize a workout and progression advice is minimal
it literally just lets you do whatever activities at any time
now i could go to the gym and do exactly the same thing but i still would want to get some advice from someone or something
wii fit doesnt do itanother problem is that between activities you have to stop and navigate menus
itd be much better if there was a flowchart like menu for setting up workouts so you can go one after the other keeping the heart rate up
this is a very serious deficiency and i wonder why nintendo didnt put it inall in all as an introduction to fitness its pretty good and at  its really pretty affordable if you have a wii already
but i really hope some other company comes out with a good fitness videogame using the balance board with more workout and eating tips
that would really be a great thingyeah the wii fit is fun and motivational
however there are certain things about it that make me wonder if its really helpful in the long run
weve had it for  days now and here are the quirks i notice  it asks you the weight of your clothing estimated
we all assumed that it took the amount you weighed and subtracted the estimated clothing weight to provide you with your weight for the day
however i recently started occasionally weighing myself undressed
every time i do that even though i do tell it my clothes weigh  lb it tells me my weight is between  and  pounds less than the day before when i wore clothing
if the next day i weigh myself clothed and tell it my clothes are  lb it tells me my weight is between  and  pounds higher than the day before when i was undressed
i really do not believe my weight is fluctuating by  pounds a day so i dont entirely trust the wii fit weight calculations
during the body test some days im good and some days im not
just like most people i suspect
but some days i will be consistently offbalance across the testing and fakely higher in weight see  above and yet my wii fit age is  years lower than my real age
by contrast some days i ace all the balance tests and have appeared to lose weight and my wii fit age goes up alarmingly
im   one day my wii fit age was 
the very next day it was down to   so i dont trust the wii fit age calculations
this may be because our wii fit platform is calibrated wrongly or because everyone in my family is unbalanced ha ha but we all seem to have our center of balance quite a bit further back than the cross hairs on the tests
all three of us find ourselves leaning artificially forward in order to hit the cross hairs instead of standing as we normally do
when we stand normally were back near the bottom edge of the graph
but the wii fit doesnt tell us this is a problem
so why have the cross hairs if it doesnt count
during running exercises if you dont have a pocket youre supposed to hold the wii remote while you run in place
we have tried it both ways
holding the remote makes it jiggle more and it results in a faster time for the person holding it
anyone who puts the remote in a pocket comes in far far behind on the running games
so were not sure which is more accurate
the remoteinpocket might not get as much movement as a person running really would have on the other hand the remoteinhand probably gets shaken more than a person running really wouldso we use it as a fun and general measurement of how were doing but its not part of a serious workout or monitoring regimen for usthe new expansion is funbut not worth the money
since ive already paid for it ill run my main up to  but unless cat is something unbelievablei doubt i bother
not knocking the people who love it
glad you have something you enjoy
this just seems like more of sameeven after a  month break from iti cant believe after  years blizzard give this to us
lets see somefacts the game was not it for casual players now it is worse
do you remember how impossible it was to gather  gold for a casual player for the flying epic mount now there is a mammoth mount that transports  players and it costs  gold
fantastic blizzard the quests are the samego kill x of ydeliver some boxgather x of y death knight an overpower class it is ruining the amusement of the other classes
now all reroll as dk
 of players online in any battleground are dks
also they start at level 
awesome blizzard naxxramas an old level  raid zone is level  now
for the next expansion what we would get perhaps ahn qiraj in level  no world pvp if you try to attack some town of the opposite factionfrom nowhere a bunch of high level guards rape your character
bottom line you have to pay a bunch of gold in fix your armor
is this fun just one more battleground
at least you can add  or  more
is it so difficult to make a map for a bg no gnome healers
after  years the gnome is the only class with no heals at all
come on blizzard
imagine how cute a gnome priest or druid or shammy could be they removed all attunement from outlands raids but no in the classics raids
wtf they nerfed almost all classes in patch  but what about the infamous fear of the warlock
fear is the worst game mechanic ever leveling from  can be a nightmare for new players to wow
the fact that i have to level up  levels make myself sick
ill never make a new char again
no waybut dont worry at least you can get a haircut in orgrimmar if youare horde or in stormwind if you are alliancethe expansion is very well done
the new content is inventive engaging and very well produced
so why only  stars
the new instances and raid content are way too easy
blizzard didnt just dumb this game down they emasculated itafter all the hype people gave this game i was expecting the revolution of mmorpg games from it
i suppose that my expectations could be considered to high
this game is nothing more than an upgraded version of lineage  meets world of warcraft
you have a wow style quest system in a lineage  style world and lore
open world pvp which is not optional as well as a very steep grind
if you are the type who enjoys to quest for  hours to gain a single level then maybe you will be able to reach the level cap in this game
from my personal experience aion has a much steeper grind than wow so if you are looking for something more casual or an upgrade to wow i would say try other games first
this can be a fun game but only if you are willing to put in the huge massive amounts of time it will take you to level up your characteralong with the terrible grind you also have a broken security system
in the  months that i played this game  people in my legion were hacked and their accounts suspended
they did absolutely nothing wrong in fact i knew one person from another game who came with me to try this one
ncsoft does a terrible job at keeping the game secure and your account can be compromised at any time
if you really want to try this game i would say wait until at least the end of  if the game is still alive by then it should be more polished refined and the security issues should be a thing of the pastis the phrase that comes to mind when someone mentions aion to me
while aion boasts some impressive graphics and pvp  pvpve the celestial battle ahead is not without some heavy flaws
this might make the game hard to swallow for some gamers but a perfect fit for others
 do not be put off by my  star rating
every game is different in the hands of different gamers
while i may of not enjoyed aion perhaps you might
 gameplay aion is one of many fantasy based mmos on the market
you could sit back and compare mmo to mmo all day long from a wow ui to an everquest this or that but what it comes down to is how the mmo handles
in this aspect i feel that aion has a mixed gameplay feeling
there are many pros to the gameplay but also quite a few cons that simply refuse to go away it seems
ive tried aion at launch at the  month mark and with the new expansion
in all  attempts the gameplay just really didnt do it for me or the pvp experiencegameplay pros  aspects about the gameplay i found enjoyable are the use of macros and fluid combat
the game boasts some awesome graphicssee design and it shines when it comes to environments and combat especially
skills look great and animations are very fluid
in fact it might have some of the best looking combat in any mmo i have played
the game uses macros where you can code skills into a single click this lets you trigger multiple skill combos off without cluttering your skill bar
while other mmos have similar features i feel aion has the best implementation of macrosvery simple and easy to program  the ability for flight is a nice twist on combat
it comes in handy sometimes for strategic assaults on enemies or even a little pvp ambushgameplay cons  the grind is just bad
at launch it was horrific and after some patching it improved but still this game really makes you work hard for your levels
this aspect scared quite a few people away as once you hit around level  it becomes terrifying to level
flight mechanics are also very unreliable due to clunky controls plus take forever to recharge making essence gathering a bit time consuming
speaking of gathering exactly why is there a successfail bar
either i gather my material or i fail there is no reason why i need to wait there  seconds and watch as two bars slowly fill up and cross my fingers that success beats fail
questing becomes a nightmare in parts
it can go from simple soloish quests to suddenly a mandatory  party group to fight elites all for a simple quest worth less experience than killing a few mobs
not trying to nitpick but it can just feel overly grindish at times to the point where it is an obvious time sink not to mention how incredibly grindy combat gets in pve at times
the pvp is also a major problem which i will get into belowgameplay summary skill effects graphics fluidity flight mechanics add strategy to the mix mainly pvp focused macro system handled professionally and very easy to use excessive grind clunky flight mechanics questionable gathering  crafting system quest design is poor pvp mechanics this is what aion really is all about
pvpve
pretty  much there is your standard pvp  but also thrown into the mix is the balaur which serve as ai based combatants that will agro either side
at any time the balaur might target your group and swing the tide of battle during your fight or come to aid you before turning their eyes on you
it is an interest concept that does add some flair to pvp
while all this does sound good there are serious problems with the pvp in aion
it pretty much is a gankfest
it comes down to who ganks first who has the fastest computer etc
i was in battles that literally were crashing computerssee design because of just how graphically intense the game is plus how much is going on
sometimes it was almost impossible to capture points simply because everyone would lag up to garbage fps and the game became unplayable
the game has no mercy
if you want to advance you will be forced to pvp and quest in hostile zones where you will be repeatedly ganked body camped and have your quest mobs killed
the game is setup that waythere is no pve aspect to this game
yes there are maps in which no pvp can occur but these areas will not advance you to level cap nor advance the storyline for you
in the end you will be forced to trudge through the pvp infested areas of the game and will be ganked repeatedly
 game design aion is a visual masterpiece for an mmo
graphically it is two steps ahead of any mmo on the market today
while this is a blessing it also can be a curse
this makes aion fairly graphically intense
do not let the system requirements fool you
people with high end sli rigs have crashed during massive pvp gankfests even when setting graphics to low
it is a lot for a pc to take in with so much happening so fast
however in a way this is a good thing because it does tell you that pvp can be intense
it is a war out there and it isnt prettyin the good sense
gear looks incredible
pump up the graphics and your character just looks amazing
there was a ton of effort put into the character design and gear even how your wings lookclass wise aion handles that by allowing you to select a master class basic like healer caster rogue warrior
complete your ascension and you will be given the choice of two classes often counters of one another like a dps gladiator or the tanking guardian
once the selection is made you cant undo it so there is no multiclassing
skills will be obtained by purchasing skill books every few levels
at this point it becomes a standard mmo take quests kill mobs etc etc
level up very slowly to get strong and hit cap where you can run dungeons and participate fully in pvp
 overall not much more i can say
ive tried aion quite a few times and actually was the last of my friends left playing it
everyone tried it in my guild but in the end we all returned to our previous mmo at the time
it is hard for me to admit that aion is a bad game simply because that is just my opinion
what is bad to me might be amazing to another but seeing as how my entire guild left the game within  months might say something about aions quality
even after a year and expansion the game has not changed enough to make it enjoyable for me
the grind the ganking the grindy combat  it is still all therewith all that i said in mind i give aion  stars
it just doesnt have any long term appeal to me nor anything that brings enjoyment
there is no sense of accomplishment either
it is just  grind grind  however if you are interested in aion as a possible mmo you should ask around the aion forums for a trial
players who have enough time into the game can issue trial keys to people to give them some time to try the game out
best way to judge a game is to play it yourself in the end  note aion has merged multiple servers in the na and eu due to low player count
na has  servers  oceanic has  server  eu has  servers note you can check the aion main page to find server stats  of guilds class breakdowns etc currently on the server
however these s are inaccurate since they count total accounts not currently active accountsvisually stunning and rich with content aion is the best mmo released in recent memoriesbuyers beware after level  the game lapses into a seemingly endless cycle of grind
the grind is obvious and there is no way around itpvp at early level basically involves the entry level players being mercilessly torn apart and harassed by high level playerssure it might not sound like much but combined with the tedious and somewhat boring leveling curve one could be persuaded to seek entertainment elsewheremeanwhile botters plague the game while ncsoft fails to even make a halfhearted effort to rid the game of those pestsaion is a solid game
it has everything a mmo needs to be successful yet falls short on some key aspect
yet if you are an avid mmo lover like myself give aion a go
its worth a buy
the inevitable grind and playerhostile environment will drive many away but to some its an experience unlike othersover the years i have played many mmos aion impressed me in a very positive way for the first ten levels of my characters existence
the quests had a good flow nice story and overall you felt as if your character had some kind of meaning this really drove the game on and was fun
as the game progressed into the levels  that feeling wore away to feeling like you were just grinding for the next level
most of the loot in the game is found either through crafting or relatively rare world drops
i kept playing on because i wanted to get to the abyss try my hand at pvping and hopefully the game would pick up
and it didkindaafter getting into the abyss and leveling a bit in there it was fun again but after  levels now about level  it has gotten rather stale
my character is level  and i have not logged into my account in well over a week
the game started out with a huge bang but it quickly fizzledncsoft has attempted to keep player retention up by offering freebies on the monthly anniversaries while this is a nice gesture i would have preferred more content and quests
i found that at some levels i would run out of doable quests midway and would have to mindlessly grind away the rest of the level on trash mobs and jumping playersalso this is a personal gripe the inability to fly freely everywhere is really annoying
i literally spent most of my time trekking on foot for long distances and it was just a dragmy wife had gotten bored of age of conan because it had become almost like another job
to lighten things up i picked her up a copy of aion after hearing all the buzz about it
she seems to have enjoyed the game quite a bit and so i tried my hand making a scout and exploring the world
thats when i remembered she loves to grindlet me start off with the pros this game is the second most beautiful game ive seen first being age of conan say what you will i love that game
aion is also the most fluid and stable game ive ever played beating out wow war aoc and champions by a smidgen
combat so far is quite simple for melee i dont play casters and easy to get into
for those who like a learning curve theres not a whole lot of quest markers so you get more of a challenge on questsbut thats all i can really thing of as pros as beautiful as the game is its just a grindier version of wow
worse yet the lack of classes class depth and class orginiality
it makes it hard to make a class your own aside from stigmas and manastone socketing
resource gathering was easy but then became a chore all you do is go up to a node and click it a couple times
worse yet you have have to lvl your resource gathering for quests
for all the hype quests are your standard mmo fare kill this gather that find himher
now to some of my biggest gripes in the game
gold spammers are the biggest problem in this game
if youre going to pick this game up beware
i went afk yesterday and came back to  gold spam messages in the course of five minutes
five
ncsoft apparentally doesnt care about  these players but as expensive as this game gets having to pay to bind yourself items costing alot etc
i could only imagine what itll do to the games economy
next problem i had were the exploiters
in this game you can choose what instance to play in to avoid too many players
but you can use that to farm boss monsters kill a monster and switch to another instance
finally the griefing in this game if you out dps someone on a monster you split the exp and if you out dps the other player you get the loot
that can only spell trouble in the futurethis game will be popular about ex wow players anime fans and neone who loves pretty stuff
dont get me wrong i havent experienced it all but from what i did experienced it was not for methe first thing youll probably notice about aion is that it is graphically amazing
it uses cryengine and is undoubtedly the best looking mmo in existence at the moment
character models in particular are incredibly detailed superior to even most singleplayer rpgs
character customization is also extensive and very well done you can truly make a unique character in every possible way from facial features which has more sliders than oblivion or fallout  to body appearance armor and size
if you want a game where you have maximum control over your look this is as good as it getslets face it though great graphics only take you so far
in terms of gameplay aions a pretty standard mmo trade and gathering skills quests dungeons etc
this is nothing new to anyone thats played an online rpg
if youre expecting brand new game mechanics or anything revolutionary youre going to be disappointed
that in itself isnt bad a solid polished triedandtrue formula game with graphics like this would be a surefire hit
unfortunately aion is far from this very far
i can see it becoming a game to challenge the likes of wow but its going to take a lot of work and to be quite frank ncsoft is not known for moving quickly on changes
additionally the few areas where aion does deviate from triedandtrue game mechanics are uniformly badly implemented and more than anything else are likely to turn off the majority of new playersthose considering trying aion may have heard that its pvp oriented
this is most assuredly true and it is a very extreme case
ive seen a lot of people complain that other ncsoft games eg
guild wars focused too heavily on pvp
until youve played this one however youve got no idea
you can pvp literally anywhere you can travel and you can travel just about anywhere
theres almost no place thats safe pretty much the two starter areas and the capital city are it
there is absolutely nothing preventing high level players or even worse groups of high level players from entering low level areas and slaughtering hapless low level players trying to do quests
furthermore lower level characters are not merely at a disadvantage when encountering higher level ones
they are completely utterly hopelessly helpless
you cant even hit other players  or more levels higher than you and even if you could it wouldnt even hurt them
this is pvp at its worst not fair or fun in any sense of the term
there also seems to be high level players on every server that literally spend all day killing low level people purely for fun
due to the way the game is designed its not just easy to do this but ridiculously so
even if you call over high level players from your own side to kill the offenders they can be back in a matter of seconds
this is probably the heaviest deterrent to new players and i actually know people that have quit this game purely because of it
i can see why even though i enjoy pvp i would rather do it when i want to not when some virtual sadist  levels higher than me wants to
its something that could be pretty easily remedied via patching but im pretty sure ncsoft wont do it until they realize its killing them by which point itll be far too latethe problems with pvp would be forgivable if the pve content was excellent
unfortunately it falls far short of that
for the most part youre stuck doing mob killing quests many of which are repeatable for reputation
this isnt faction reputation like in wow though its per quest giver rep if you do enough repeatable quests for someone they give you special rewards
this sounds like a cool idea until you realize how many you have to do on average a hundred turnins
these are not short quests either on average they take about  mins to complete each time
i honestly dont see why anyone would bother or what the developers were even thinking
most of the campaign quest content requires a group which is inconvenient considering how few players there are at any given level on any given server it can take upwards of an hour to put together a halfway viable group and this is during peak hours
dungeons are likewise lackluster and poorly designed
first off theres absolutely no safe places you can literally get killed by a patrol at the very entrance of a dungeon without even moving from the doorway
for some reason theres also upper level caps on dungeons which means you cant help lower level friends and can only run each place a few times per character
theres also a full day lockout on all dungeons a la wow heroics and this lockout occurs when you zone in
to make matters worse bosses in these instances often drop no loot
you read that right you can run an entire instance and literally not get anything
even worse its possible for items to drop that are only usable by the other faction
it remains to be explained why things are even factionbound but this would be akin to an allianceonly item dropping on horde side in wow with no means to move it there
on that note you cant communicate at all with the other side
you cant even create new characters on the other side of the same server unless you have more than one aion account
lastly if you die in an instance you resurrect wherever your bind point was
to put it in wow terms itd be like resurrecting at your hearth which is pretty bizarre
generally speaking instancing is unbelievably primitive and poorly executed
after seeing how badly designed the dungeons in guild wars were and now this im firmly convinced ncsoft is simply incapable doing ittheres also a host of lesser things that could definitely use more polishing such as the camera options inventory management and quest tracking
some things as basic as targeting are glitchy and theres a lot of skills and abilities that are ridiculously imbalanced
for that matter theres just plain too many of both enough to make your head spin even if youre a guild wars veteran
theres no support for addons and macros are buggy and very limited in scope
youll find frequent inconsistencies and problems with mob scaling area design and itemization
for example quests often require you to kill specific mobs but in the same area therell be slightly different named mobs that look and act exactly the same but wont give you quest credit
many stats are either partly or totally useless for example magic crit doesnt affect any spells only your magic weapon autoattacks
you can also find in almost any given zone quests and enemies with a level difference higher than  when you consider theres only  levels in the game you can see why this is just a tad weirddying to anything but an enemy player also causes you to lose experience and it is very easy to die
an alarming number of pve enemies can stunlock or silence you which means aggroing more than one is very likely to kill you unless you pop consumables
elite mobs are often indistinguishable from regular ones and just as often intermixed with them
especially if youre not in plate most of these will kill you so quickly you wont even know what hit you
theres also some other more minor quirks such as an odd tendency for the game to quit completely if you get disconnected and melee enemies hitting you at range good luck trying the reverse
lag is handled very poorly youll often rubberband just like in guild wars and due to the flight aspect this can be directly fatal
resource nodes also have an ugly inexplicable habit of despawning if you cancel gathering or get interrupted by something
resource gathering in general is slow boring and buggy youll often fail to gather immediately due to a bug that has inexplicably never been fixed
these issues taken individually might not seem irritating at first but the more you play the more it wears on you because theres always at least one of them apparentlastly lets talk about flying
this aside from the freeforall pvp is one of the exciting new features trumpeted by the developers
unfortunately either as a result of balancing or just due to sheer lack of imagination theyve made it little more than a means of travel
and a pretty bad one at that even wows flying mounts limited as they are to two continents are far more flexible
the vast majority of areas disallow flying including some places where you would think itd be a nobrainer to allow it eg
capital cities complete with floating islands accessible only by a  minute round trip by boat
theres skills geared towards flying combat but in practice its just too unwieldy to be any fun
at any rate theres a hard time limit on how long you can fly at once and inexplicably also a flight cooldown that limits how often you can sprout your wings
potions wing upgrades and manastones can extend flight as can flying through special rings in places like the abyss but if you were expecting to spend a lot of time in the air in this game you will be extremely disappointedbelieve it or not i could easily double the length of this review with other bugs problems balance factors and things that just plain need improvement
to sum it all up aion is a game that could be great if they would fix most or heck even a fraction of the problems with it
unfortunately that list of problems is so long and with so many intractable issues related to fundamental game design that i honestly dont think its likely or even feasible
aion will probably survive for some time due to its original hardcore fan base especially the korean market which seems to get all the updates months ahead of everyone else
however i really dont see it getting any bigger or more successful and once a  true successor to wow finally shows up i doubt anyone will even remember it
i picked it up mainly because i was bored out of my mind with wow but my aion experience has been so disappointing that ive decided to just go backive never played such a linear mmo in my life to be honest
you are led around in a very very small enviornment from one npc hub to the next with no options for character development beyond super bland pve and grindtastic crafting until   all quests are either fetch or kill x amount of mob quests crafting is simply gathering endless resources and sitting there waiting as you craft items there is no involvement with crafting besides picking which item you want to craft and selecting ok then waiting
flying is a joke since you can hardly ever do it in the zones and the few areas you can fly you quickly run into the invisible wall phenomenon that prevents you from going further
all in all it was a major disappointment after the massive hype this game gotfirst off  the graphics are amazing
the graphics engine supports visually stunning landscapes and both the player and nonplayer characters are crafted with loving care and attention to detail if you buy this definitely look closely at the monsters you are fighting the level of detail on each is impressive
along with this you have such things as fluid cloth animation physics for hair that moves and depending on wind and movement
what is nice is that this is a very efficient graphics engine as well and though many people will eventually be bogged down in a large pvp battle a recent moderate system will run this game with all settings on maximum easily
dont look too closely though
circles are actually octagons the landscape looks like everquest from  theres no such thing as rounded straight angles and lines on the landscape everywhere
oh and though the armor is amazing both in design and graphical quality it is of a sort of anime nature so the women arent wearing much and the guys look like mechs
since the armor is actually separate models than your character and not just skins it both looks far more impressive than most games and the pieces match unlike the clown gear of wow and it also suffers from the straight line effect
triangular breasts and square pants are in store if you dont zoom out after making your initial observationsbut graphics arent everything no matter how much the graphics and the customization of character and even equipment might appeal there needs to be something else
aion got a couple of things spot on  the skill chains are an interesting way to add some complexity to the normal onetwothree of many games
note that depending on your class and situation this just means a onetwotwotwothree button press ie
because of the way the skill chain works it many times simply activates the player clicks through and you move on to your next skill or skill chaincrafting is another big point in this game  if you can gather one type of material you can gather all similar types ie
metals foods fibers ect
form one skill which makes it much more interesting and easy to skill up gathering skills and to support multiple professions
each character has the ability to master two trade skills and another to a lesser degree
the items made from this process are very useful and often times better than the items that very rarely drop in the game
anyone who enjoys this aspect of games might find aion a nice home
also you do gain experience from tradeskills and gathering so while it is not a viable way to level you dont completely give up gaining levels when you tradeskillso why the low rating
because after having played it for several weeks i can see why people in many reviews talk about a lack of content
the fact of the matter is that the game space and world is fairly small
you wont notice this until youre at least level  but it becomes quite apparent after that
there are limited areas to quest at any level limited places to get loot or drops ect
the first instance you have access to is at level  with a  hour lockout time
did i mention youll probably leave with one to two green drops that you can sell for relatively little money
no loot unless youre really really lucky
you cant come back here after level  either
while instances getter better past this point its nothing many players of mmos will be used toquests also practically stop after level  at least as a means of gaining gear or experience
by the time you complete most quests you will have better gear than the rewards and usually killing one to two mobs will equal the quest experience reward
of course the quests usually are simply kill  of   and many of these quests are repeatable over a hundred times
so you can make what people call grinding a little more rewarding even though running back to the quest giver to turn in and reacquire the quest is probably a waste of killingexperience time
if you buy this game with the wow game mechanic and theory in mind  youre going to be severely disappointed within your first couple of days playingthere is no escape from pvp
and pvp in this game means being killed while doing the above mentioned grinding
if you dont mind this its the game for you
if you want to level up and do it to other people buy it
but for many this will become a massive source of frustration and annoyance
when it takes you  hours of killing individual mobs to level up and you have two places to do this in when a higher level player decides youre not going to use that area its game over for the day
seriously you will be killed over and over again while trying to level up
you will not even have a chance to fight back either since even if the person is youre level which they wont be they have come prepared to pvp so better gear potions scrolls ect are at their disposal to ensure that you die and they escape
parents if you are considering this game for a child be aware that after level  the player enters the one and only channel that connects the entire server together  lfg
this channel is used for chat selling of goods and people actually looking for groups
this chat is most times if not always littered with racism sexism extreme graphic sexual content vulgarity and plenty of complaining whining and arguing
since this is the only channel to effectively look for a group in youre pretty much subject to this no matter what
you will have to read it you will be exposed to itthe player base is really an issue since this is an mmo its all about the collective experience and a game that is based aside from all that grinding on social activity and interaction
ive found most people to be reasonable and many times interesting once you get a legion or a group but a very large portion of the people that still actually play this game are generally speaking very self involved unhelpful aggressive and rude
if youve played world of warcraft in an alliance battlegroundthis is the same thing all the time and much much worsei dont really want to say dont buy this game because i really like a lot of the aspects of it and id like to see the community grow  and mature so that the game can continue to develop and expand into a more finished title
at the same time if you have a tight budget and realize that this game means continuing to pay each month that you play it i dont want anyone else to buy it like me to at first think what are all these reviews on various websites and especially the game website about
this is great  its not
period
the game is korean made and there will not be two versions for a north american audience with different tastes
the game has been out for a year prior to its north america release so anyone that says it is a new game is confused
the game has been in a released format for over a yearunless you really love ganking getting killed while minding your own business by a player grinding standing around killing the same things over and over and over again for hours if not days and a less than supportive or involved community of teens at each others throats id highly recommend that you find a different means of occupying your timeif your immediate response to this review that states as clearly as i can some of the most important aspects of the game that a prospective buyerplayer might have is stop whinging qq and whatever else you use to describe someone who is dissatisfied or unimpressed with a product then this is the game for you
you will fit into the community immediately and probably enjoy the gamethis game is just ok its nothing different from a combination of wow and gw
same skills same armor same weapons same quests
the one big issue is the idea that you are forced to group up at about lvl  in order to progress any further into the game
if you dont like being forced to group this game isnt for you
its fun but really i got bored after only playing for about  or  days
its new and exciting at first until you realize you cant fly everywhere only in certain areas in others you are limited to gliding
i thought it was great at first but it lost its appeal really fast and i played gw for over  years and wow for about a year
if i were anyone thinking about playing this game i would just wait until gw or cataclysm come out or just buy a good rpg for your consoleif you have nothing better to do with your time and think that killing that th board thats red this time is fun then this game is for you
by the time i hit level  i was out of quests
i searched everywhere none left i had to grind to  i was like great
a new level
new quests
nope
there was maybe  more i could find and i was done with those quickly
so i ran an instance training ground and got a whole level off of it
ok now im level 
new quests
nope
there was even less maybe  and i was forced to grindthe world pvp was total zerg
the land is too cluttered with mobs
its basically whoever can force the other player to train mobs on each other wins
also noone dies v
as a cleric i could just keep myself up forever
heres the problem
all non healing classes too
i couldnt keep anyone in range that was ranged from getting away or just potting endlessly or  bandagingthe world pvp objectives were a joke
it was worse than wintergrasp ever wasexcept for the lag
what i saw was about  people zerging a mob that took over  minutes to kill
then we got it to  or so and wiped
it was so boring i literally almost fell asleep healing itthere are alot of cool things
minimal downtimeno water needed
you can res in combat
flashy graphics
you can paint your armor etc etcbut it doesnt get around the fact that its another sucky mmo with huge grind
it fails in all the same ways warhammer failed
it doesnt offer enough that wow doesnt
dont get me wrong i think wow is an unbalanced piece of junk
i play my arena games and logoff
but this game im actually going to ditch in the first month
i hoped more than anythign this would be a wow killer
it wontalso a buddy of mine did some calculations to get the uber abyss gear
he basically said it was a grand marshallhigh warlord equivalent grind
fk thatpoor graphics poor physics poor control response
crash everything in sight is ok and different but if it had been produced better it would be worth buying
as it is its just plain poorthis is a decent game for the crash and burn fanatics 
its fun to play but it doesnt compare with split second in my opinion
which i was hoping for a fair comparison between the two
its still a ok gameafter playing this game for a while now i want to update my reviewthis game is fun ok play but they ruined the game play with way to much debris being thrown into the track and then the game will crash you no matter what you do with the controls
so they took a lot of the human control out of the game playon a  to  scale  being the best i now rate this game at a  fun yes to much effort put into all the debris around the track which should have been applied to the realism of the game or better more realistic car controlafter having played this game to the end i find it to be a complete disappointment
the game is set up so you loose control of the cars for no reason and it forces you to wreck
there is no human control over the game the farther you get into it
you are playing against a computer game that is intentionally set up to keep you from being able to finish the game
i am completely let down by this gamei now do not recommend this gamelost via domus is a very disappointing game
im a very big fan of the lost tv show
ive watched every episode more than once
ive bought books about the show
ive checked out websites to get more details about the show
even with the negative reviews of the game i took a chance because i thought my love of the show would be enough to make it worth my time
unfortunately the game is just too much of a messas mentioned in other reviews the game feels empty
in the tv show almost all of the scenes out on the beach are filled with characters some important some not
in the game youre lucky if there are half a dozen people in an area
so instead of making it feel like youre playing the tv show you just get reminded of what youre missingcertain game conceits the things done to provide you with some game play directly contradict the show
you character walks around finding water bottles lying around island but the show made a big point of how scare those bottles were
they were hoarded by certain characters not scattered across the beach and the junglethere are annoying cave sequences that feel tacked on and not in the spirit of the showthe passage of time feels inconsistent
events that occur weeks apart apparently happen during the time it takes to walk from the beach to some location in the jungle
also some events almost certainly didnt happen within the lost continuity which feels like a cheat since part of the reason of playing the game is to learn more answers about the islandthere were some good things
i liked exploring some of the locations from the tv show as they felt pretty true to the sets used on the show
the graphics were decent
it definitely doesnt push the game system but it looks better than it probably could have on the previous generations consoles
some of the voice work is good though some of the characters dont sound anything like their tv show counterpartsmy biggest problem with the game is that is just isnt very fun
i played the game for the story and while it was pretty good it is surrounded by a system that makes it a chore to play
i think fans of the show should just find a summary of the plot details online and skip the game entirelylet me start by saying that this version of lost is virtually identical to its  counterpart
the only difference is that the ps version installs part of the game on the consoles hard drive to make the rather obnoxious loading times a little more palatable
other then that the two games are exactly the same
if you already own one version theres no reason at all to doubledipbeing a modest fan of the show i was looking forward to checking lost out at some point
recently my local library actually started to lend out a small selection of  games so when i saw that via domus was among the games i grabbed it for myself
now that ive finished it i can say that although the game isnt offensively bad im really glad this isnt one that i paid foras for the good the rendering of the island itself is really quite good and the jungle certainly has the right lush tropical look and feel to it
it still travels sort of linear though
if you travel too far off track youll just be bounced back on the correct path
i think it would have been more fun if it was a little more open so you could just carve your own paths with a machete and map out the island on your ownthe music for the game uses the score to the tv show so the sound to the game is completely authentic and terrific
the voice acting on the other hand is godawful
virtually nobody from the alist cast showed up and nobody sounds like themselves
john lockes voice in particular i didnt think was even close
its strange too because i remember several interviews with matthew fox doing press for the game
i just assumed his voice was included but it isntthe game includes a bartering system to gain objects youll trade papayas and coconuts for a torch or a lantern for example
unfortunately outside of a couple of torches and one gun which i kid you not you shoot no more then three times  only one of which is a person you dont really need anything
the whole trading system turns out to be kind of a farcethe story is ok and mildly interesting even if the ending had me scratching my head but it is really short
i finished the game  in what couldnt have been more then  hours of play
i was hoping that to some extent lost would use games like drakes uncharted or tomb raider as a template for its game play but instead the game play itself feels like an episode of the tv show and its not very interactive
this has the game commit the mortal sin of just being dullsimply put theres just no meat here to sink your teeth into and with very little else going in the right direction theres not much at all working for the game to justify a purchase
if you were a diehard fan of the show and somehow fall into a copy of lost i cant honestly say its not worth at least checking out
that said however if you have to plunk down so much as a nickel to play this skip it
its just not worth it
id have been really disgusted with myself if i paid anything to play thisheres what i liked about the gameits lost im a fan of the tv show
not much i can say beyond that
familiar faces and scenesheres what i didnt like about the gamethe game is repetitive basic and short
there are a lot of cut scenes that you are forced to watch
there is not much in the way of challenges in this game most puzzles are the same with a slight increase in complexity as you go through the game
it is mostly walking around and solving the same types puzzles
the interaction with other characters is nothing special either the dialog is weak and linear as is the entire gameoverall it seemed like a slightly interactive tv showi would not recommend this game unless you want to add it to your lost memorabiliathe game was far to short
i did enjoy what i played but i racked up  gamerscore via all  achievements in less than  hours
i wish they would make a nd game maybe let telltale make the game this timethe storyline was enjoyable thoughthe screwdriver works but i have to put some force into it before it will actually unscrew the triwing screws for the ds lite
for the game boy advance sp it worked like a charmthis does fit the listed consoles and handhelds but it is poorly made
i purchased two of these and they both broke quickly with minimal force applied
the bit portion of the driver becomes torn out of place inside the handle upon very light use if not the first turn
spend the extra few dollars and get something betterthis is an actionrpg game that has been around for awhile
i understand that gothic  is widely regarded as a classic and that gothic  has more bugs than virginia in august
unfortunately i was unable to get gothic  or  to work on my computer
i understand that these games were originally built to be used with win  os but this repackaging says it should work with win xp
i lost interest in trying to get those games up and running so ill just mention gothic   it works fairly well however there is very long loading times and the gameplay tends to stutter often on my system
i am running win xp service pack  with a amd athlon  x dual core  ghz  gig ram and a geforce gt card
i am sure these specs are well above the requirements for this game as it is older
there seems to be alot to like in gothic  if it would only run properly
i tried getting a patch and found some community patches that didnt really help me
i have also played risen which is by the same company and seems to be a spiritual successor to gothic and is quite outstanding graphics are great and it runs well
in short proceed with caution if considering a purchase
im not too unhappy as the game only cost me a few bucks on amazon and i didnt have high expectations anyway
i would recommend going with risen which is somewhat of a new game made by the same company with many of the same conventions as gothicyes its an old game but i have old games that still look beautifulthis one actually runs on everything from windows  windows  on a high end win  bit with juiced up graphics the terrain still looks awful
its flat and its very difficult to determine high by the view alonethe planes respond sluggishlyenemy planes appear fast and turn on a dime while your plane is clumping along about to snap apart at a very slow speedenemy planes zoom past and are in the distance in seconds even when you are flying at top speedeven mission maps are riddled with gigantic pixelsthis could have been fun even in its grainy state but the sluggish nature of the planes sucked all of the fun out of this  disc settoo badthe controller itself looks great but every time i respawn i automatically throw a grenade haloi did not contact seller about this issue and dont plan to cost of shipping and all that jazz its just not worth it to send it back and get a replacementfirst off the only reason i bought this ep was because of all the good reviews it gottheres really nothing good about this ep
i have to say its probably the worst that maxis ever put out
i change families and my kids grow up fast i dont need  mr humbles showing up at the door nor do i desire to have countless popups of gained and lost enthusiasm in hobbies which lead to secret hobby lots which are basically smaller versions of community lots and your access to them can be denied once your hobby levels dropthe only things i like are the new cribs and nursery sets for toddlers and the bohemian and ballet outfits for our girlsyuck i want to sell my copy nowthere are not many good games out to use this for
save your money and buy something else
dont recommendthe main reason for getting the ps eye is to use for capturing photos to use in little big planet
but even then there are rumors of allowing you to import your photos from memory cards
so you may not need it down the roadi downloaded the free eye create software from the playstation network
this accessory is useless if you dont have access to the free plaaystation network since it doesnt come with a software discso this product should be evaluated in conjunction with the eye create software since thats what you need to record photos and video
i found the software to have very awkward controls
and you dont even capture photosvideo at full screen its only part of the screen
plus the editing features such as effects filters are nothing that you really havent seen before
if you have a macbook or imac with a builtin isight camera then you will not be impressed at all by this software since it is much more limited
i was also hoping to record some time lapse of my living room
the video seems to stop recording after an hour of recorded content
if youre recording nontime lapse video you can record up to  minutes worth
this is true even  your ps harddrive is empty since there is a size cap within this softwareif you were to compare the eye create software to shareware that you can download for your webcam then this would be shareware that you would not want to pay for
its that badcamera quality sucks and i expected much more from sony
it does work somewhat better in a room with more light but not that big of a differenceafter the break through in hd quality p the full hd followed it and were now in time where d is reality in every house
wait wait with sony eye you will go back to tradition  where d and fhd or hd is not important your going back to the  aspect ratio and the lovely poor colors i thought for the first time ive seen my self on this camera that im the hulk since i turned in green color thanks to sony great technologythis camera has a good concept but image quality is sd dont expect anything it has the doom resolution  colors are terrible however you might enjoy it thinking that your turned into the hulk or batman
believe me when i took it back to the store they asked to check it before refunding me the money and the store manager immediately refunded back the money to me guys were in the end of  and this is the lowest ever image quality i have seen since  yearsaudio quality i was astonished by the idea that  built in microphones thinking that i will have a great sound it appeared that my voice was turned into et
voice some how my voice is chopped and it was more like robot then human its not at all a good microphones tested on windows and psgood it has an optical zoom it looks good onlyguys if you have new flat  tv this is not at all your baby
recommended to  tv onlyevery first person shooter is going to be fun at some point
the same can be said for every star wars game
the first star wars fps was dark forces a game far ahead of its time and filled with addictive fun
following on the heels of its success was jedi knight dark forces ii in which kyle katarn the hero of dark forces wields a lightsaber and the force
both games had intriguing puzzles which were never the same and plotlines which could rival any hollywood blockbuster
from this foundation of gaming and writing quality arose mysteries of the sith jedi outcast arguably the best star wars game ever created and jedi academyi expected nothing less from republic commando
but instead it seemed rather plotless and very redundant
their were no challenging puzzles or miniquests one might say
it was basically run and shoot some stuff then run and shoot some more stuff
also the game has several nearly impossible clockticking deadlines to meet
and on easy level at that
another complaint i have has to do with storyline continuity
in the republic commando novels by karen traviss the commandos are always led by a jedi general
but there are no jedi generals in this game
this point is drilled hard time and again in hard contact
there is one dead jedi that the player stumbles upon in the course of the game
perhaps there may be sequels of better quality
but if you want a star wars fps thats fun and has lots of replayability then i highly recommend jedi outcast
if you prefer the challenge of not having the lightsaber and force try to find an old version of dark forces
i sure miss that game
and if youre simply intrigued by the republic commando stories then you may wish to check out karen travisss trilogyi wanted to like republic commando but i cant give it better than two starsdespite the fantastic graphics and my initial excitement and enjoyment when i first started playing i soon found this game to be mostly annoying
the fact that you automatically reload every few seconds in a fire fight despite having  rounds of ammo on your gun display and when have you ever seen anyone ever have to reload in a star wars movie anyway gets tedious very quickly
i was also bothered by my teams ghost images showing all the different positions they could take in a fire fight sniper postion cover for grenades etc and just the fact that you had to waste time actually tageting those positions to give the command instead of using that time to target the enemies wailing on you
finally the enemies themselves were a little too powerful especially for the numbers they swarm you in
i constantly ran out of ammo from full load trying to take down a single super battle droid or genosian elite
im sorry but when i am constantly finding myself down to my single shot pistol while surrended by numerous enemies and very few areas where new ammo can be obtained so that i constantantly need to reload from dying so much that ceases to be challenging and just becomes annoyingi got the game and put into the computer and installed it then i played it and i was really disappointed about how laggy it was i went into the settings and change the video settings i put on auto detect and it put a everything at high and distance really far and when i played again when i start walking or turning it laggs about a second behind and that gets to be a pain
i also tried the lowest graphics and that didnt male a difference at all
i am running bit windows  with  gigs of ram and a dual core intel pentium at  and a nvidia ion graphic card on a msi windtop
but the gameplay is very fun and immersivemy wife and i have tried all of the karaoke games available for ps  and singstar is the worst
its not even closefirst the inability to dial down the voice but leave the background music is enough alone to dump this for a good used karaoke revolution
then the mics  theyre much heavier  perhaps x as heavy as the kr microphones and much bigger meaning harder to store when you put everything awaythe game itself well its not really a game
its just karaoke
kr is a game where you compete unlock things win trophies etc
ss does allow you unlock a few songs but the gameplay is boring and unfulfillingthe scoring is obnoxious and annoying compared to kr as well
it grades x more for singing the exact phrasing as the original than singing on pitchgo buy a ps  theyre terrific
then go to ebay and type in karaoke revolution ps and actually enjoy singing into your tvnot the greatest game but hey it was cheep
the zapper is just a waste of space
i thought it would be cool to have but its easier to play without it
the game needs work its got a good concept but is only fun for a few hours
this is coming from a game nerd with over k in games  equipmentafter playing with this thing for  minutes or longer expect to start feeling uncomfortable
they should make one that lets you bring the nunchuk further back so its not so close in that awkward position
the zelda game that comes with it though is fun short but funheres the problem
works ok on games where the shooting area doesnt leave the screen like a bullseye that isnt moving
in a first person shooter game with controls formatted for the zapperi found myself dioriented
i need to turn  degrees to shoot the guy to my right but that is actually about  degrees or just off screen
it looks fun but ends up being a pain in the butt to usemy kid threw it down after  minutesnintendo accessories are pretty terrible
it all started with the power glove back in the day and hasnt gone up hill any sincenintendos secondary controllers and primary controller accessories never really seem to be thought through or tested that much
in this case i was playing umbrella chronicles which sometimes has you press buttons that are on top of the wiimote such as a when they flash on screen
if you arent quick enough to press the button then you get hurt or die
its a lot harder to quickly press buttons on top of the wiimote when it rests on top of this zapper and your hand is gripping the handle below itthe links crossbow training game that it comes with is fun thoughsave yourself time headache and money lots of money
my first comment is that microgarbage is for fan boys that like fantasy games like halo
if you are over  get a ps
i can write a  page article on the reasons to purchase a ps over xbox  but theres no need ill only outline the hot points like it or not bluray is the future sony did not spend b in rd for no reason ps has built in wifi xbox  is an extra  for a network adaptor ps plays blurays and plays them well micogarbage wants you to spend  an extra  so you can attach
a hddvd player ps has no yearly fees microgarbage  a year
 and this my most annoying peveps has a wireless controller and so does micogarbagethe differencemicrogarbage wireless comes with batteries for their controller
thats right they want you to purchase the rechargeable battery packin conclusion while ps does not have the same amount of games and there online gameing is still being improved upon microgarbage will pump every nickle they can out of you
do you homework save your money and buy the system that delivers it alla psgreat systemuntil i had to get it replaced cuz of an error on the systemmicrosoft customer service is also awfulthey still havent fixed the rrod problems
some of the units have better chipsets but its all random whether you get one or notthe games available are fun but many of them are also available on pc and ps platforms
many of the newer ps games are beginning to show better graphics than the  can produce so keep in mind youll probably need to buy the new xbox 
in a couple of yearspaying  a year to get online gaming is a paini would like put this game as a one but a one star rating is just laziness on the part of the designer
to be fair this game is developed in such a way i think avid new gamers will enjoy
i had to buy this game due to its ratings sounded pretty good my main complaint with this game is two fold one is presentation the story is uninspiring boring
personally i play this game i look forward to the characters failing
honestly tho when you play this game you keep thinking it will get better and you will probably just beat it because its about an  hour game
difficulty is easy to low level normal like many games honestly i would prefer the originals rereleased
basically my reason for rating it  stars if you figure for he money you paid you want to explore the world
sorry in my mind this game is sub parmy review title sums up the most important aspects of this game
this was an attempt to bring the action of the reborn ninja gaiden series to the nintendo dsthe first thing youll notice is that the game is actually quite pretty for a nintendo ds game and what it pulls off on the screen is very impressive from a technical standpointpointing at places on the screen makes your ninja go there
touching down on the screen makes ryu move there tapping enemies hits them with ranged attacks swiping them makes you attack them with your sword and just brushing up makes you jump
the game eases you into its difficulty curve so that at first it works fairly well
the game is a giant linear path excluding your hub world between missions of a series of kill every enemy in the room to proceed gameplay
it works well for the first hour or two but for the next  youll be rolling your eyes and trudging on only because the attack interaction is novel and works pretty well
some of these rooms seriously take upwards of  minutes of nonstop respawning enemies may i repeat the level design is horribleby the time you get to the last third of the game however many of the encounters are either in such poorly designed terrain or have too many enemies on the screen to make the controls manageable
when the screen is completely filled with enemies the game simply cant tell the difference between move here slash this enemy or ranged attack this enemy
jump is similarly confounded in being unable to tell if youre trying to slash a target or jump
a single incorrect input can be the difference between a flawless battle and losing half your health so you have to at least keep moving also a problem since your attacks typically commit you to being unable to dodgechange course for several seconds
with any option for careful control thrown right out the window the only viable way to attack is to simply swipe the screen back and forth to fly around and slash around wildly
bad level design then pairs up with lackluster control to provide a very poor game experience
there are also times when the terrain is a hindrance particularly on narrow ledges where you have about a pixelthin ribbon to touch that means the difference between your character moving and just standing still doing nothing or getting munched on by the damn ghost fishessome of the last bosses are also an exercise in tedium
they are the kind that take an hour and a half because to beat them takes  minutes straight  of which they are completely invincible plus a halfdozen retries learning their patterns through trial and errorto summarize this game is very pretty to look at by ds standards
it starts out interesting but poor level design and an eventual breakdown in the games  combat interface very handily kill what fun the game elicits in the early stagesthis game is a singlebutton buttonmasher pure and simple
theres little to no strategy involved in play just pick your two best weapons and hack and slash through the enemies until you run out of stamina use a health potion as needed wait a couple seconds and repeat
theres a charge feature which makes combat a bit more interesting but it is learned way too late into the game to save the simplistic combat system
the inventory system isnt great limited space in both personal and long term storage so you cant hoard items and as you are cash strapped the game often devolves in running back and forth between shops to sell items
the inventory system also lacks a sorting feature so clearing your inventory when it fills up becomes an extensive chore
as for the shops they suffer from the typical rpg flaw of rarely having any worthwhile items for your character while being swamped with particularly good items for the other classes guessing this is to facilitate a trading system for players with xbox live gold but it should be removed for solo campaigns though you can cycle the shops inventory by leaving the area and running back until you find something useful but this gets annoying after repeating a dozen times
there are no treasure chests on the map only monsters drop coin and items and the map is often linear with side passages that have nothing special so exploration is not rewarded
minion type onehit kill monsters litter the board after you defeat the regular enemies on the map theyre useful for recovering your potion supply but not for much else
the leveling system is a minimalist joke theres hardly any choices involved and learning new skills requires a bounty hunt type quest often for monsters that dont exist on the maps youre traveling on so knowing which skills to learn first becomes a task in itself
also as far as ive found most of the skills are nearly worthless in the game when compared to weapon attacks and you cant hotmap your favorite skills to the dpad so you have to go through the menu each time to switch skills which certainly breaks immersion
lastly they really should have put more effort into the voice acting most character dialogues are repeated multiple times in the game
suffice to say avoid this gamethe gameplay of kufcod is so slow that it makes it incredibly boring
seriously had the designers just doubled the pace of the fighting and ground covering alone it would be way more fun
the fighting engine is still a joke but if were sped up it could be playable
then toss in the worst item combining system i have ever seen a story so loose you will be scratching your head and camera issues that constantly crop up and you have one of the worst games ever made
i made it through  hours of gameplay and just couldnt take it anymore
and since i play ninja gaiden  a lot which has an unbelievably deep fighting engine this was even harder to try to sit through
i will still give it  stars because it had potential but in the end was poorly executed
eff this turd of a game and buy ninja gaiden  instead if you want actual action fightingthis game was fun for about the first  hours
you basically walk around hacking things up
no real stratigy in the fighting modes and being an rpg there wasnt a great variety in the things you could equip yourself with
best thing in this game was the boss fights
but i would skip this gameive been a fan of the kingdom under fire series since i played the crusaders when it came out
as a fan of strategy games i loved the fact that you had so many different units weapons and armor to choose from and i loved the fact that you could play as so many different characters in heroesi downloaded the circle of doom demo off the xbox  marketplace mostly because i was somehow hoping that despite all the bad publicity and reviews the game has gotten it would be a good gameboy was i wrongto start what happened to the strategy elements
that was the main point of the first two games so why take it out of this second onesecondly when did the game reduce itself to pure hackandslashstyled gameplay
i compare it to dynasty warriors for that reason though i will say that koeis dynasty warriors franchise is leagues ahead of this game
to give you a rundown on the gameplay its like this you start out by playing as one of the main characters then engage in a tutorial mode after a cutscene which i skipped because i could barely hear the characters talking as well as the fact that the voice acting sounded horribly lazy
this tutorial mode teaches you how to fight not very well at that
you use the a and x buttons to wield your weapons as well as the b and right button dont confuse the button with the trigger to use your magic
the first thing i noticed was how slow the response times were
another thing i noticed was that when holding the right button as it tells you to do to use one of your special abilities it didnt always respond
you end up clicking or holding the buttonanother thing the combat
when i engaged in battle with a few simple enemies i found a fourth of my health knocked down based on the pure fact that i couldnt attack them fast enough the crusaders and heroes respond times were much better and faster
i dont recall there ever being a block button which was in the previous two games
added to this slow combat movement is also slow
i can understand that the characters are carrying a good amount of weaponry and armor but that gives them no excuse to move like snails
the only excuse for that would be if they were carrying a hammer or some other weapon which my characterleinheartwasnt
finally the map has you following a set path
in the crusaders and heroes the map was free roammeaning you could go anywhere you wanted
in this game you are stuck to a set path which makes moving frustrating and even more tedious
theyre trying to pass the game off as an rpg but the only rpg elements i see is the story which doesnt seem all that good considering you cant even enjoy the voice acting and the weaponarmor customization which there is hardly any
i didnt try the coop mode but i didnt plan on playing more of this horrible game
i wouldnt be surprised if people didnt buy the fourth installment based on the fact that this one was so badthe only reason i gave the game two stars was because well i played it for ten minutes and enjoyed that small amount of time i played it though i had no intention to play it further
one final note i see that cod was made by blue side and the crusaders and heroes were made by phantagram which is an obvious indicator as to why the gameplay and everything for that matter is so different
i cannot however fathom why phantagram would entrust a different company with their series
seeing how cod turned out i hope they reconsider giving another company a right to make another game in one of their seriesif you plan on playing the kingdom under fire series skip cod and play the crusaders and heroes in that orderyou wont be disappointed in either of the twothe game is interesting in the character development but the creatures you fight are essentialy the the same over and over and over just harder
there is no room for freelancing it is very linear
move forward hack and slash reach the idol sell some stuff buy some stuff then learn a new ability and repeatkingdom under fire has evolved into many things as it has transitioned from pc over to xbox and now the   this game is now just a hack and slash
now that is not a bad thing for a hack and slash fan such as myself
but the game suffers from boring repetition and a terrible story
the graphics are just okay
the fighting mechanics are awful
you have an energy bar which goes down every time you swing a weapon the better the weapon the more energy you use
it doesnt take much for the energy to hit zero and your hero can do nothing for a few seconds as you wait for your energy to go up
this is a major no no in a hack and slash
part of the fun is wading through enemies in unrealistic fashion
i really wanted to like this game but there is too much working against fun game play for me to recommend itive made fun of trendy hipster mac using treehuggers in previous reviewsbut on this game i must agree with themfor shame the amount of pollution that was released into the atmosphere because of this game
how horrible that it will all be in the landfill someday where it belongsi rented this jewel of the vile for free thank god from my little brothers game collection
he handed it to me and said herethis one isntuhit isnt really my thingthing
hes only  so hasnt really mastered the use of the english language so i cant blame him for being unable to eloquently describe the putrid nature of this game
therefore i will help him voice his opinioni was only able to sit and play this for about an hour
i kept waiting for the game to improvebut it never did
what accent is that on the vampire character
i suppose when it came to the voice acting that they couldnt afford a guy that sounded transylvanianthey had to go for an american guy who vas taulkinguh like he vas an eeeevil scienteest goinguh to blow up zee vorld
the best part was when he called the idol of greed fattyalsowhat is wrong with this worlds populations pelvises
leonardo stood like he was in a permanant state of humping or was beginning to bloat
do the undead bloat in this world
i kept waiting for him to spike one giant chunk of his hair and say its time for a little demon cleansing i must say
old saturday night live reference for those of you too young to remember martin shorts character ed grimley
i have never played the other kingdom of fire gamesbut if ive heard correctly they were more strategybased
the makers should really have stuck to strategybecause whatever style this is simply sucksyou run aroundtrying to find monsters to train your skillswhich never happened for me
i got one spell but after that single spell heal it seemed impossible
the vampire character lennyor lactatesomething is trying to mutate to become as strong as rufusor was it randy
it was fun in an oldschool gauntlet at the arcade kind of way
after pegging the upteenthousandth little scorpion with my kunai of frost and wounding and shrieking and making toast however i simply lost interestbasicallyif you can get the game for free then have at it
it will at least fill up a little bit more space on your shelf so that when people come over they look at your games and say wow
youve got a lot of games
other than thatget something elsethe game has a few characters to choose from each has different abilities such as magic warrior assassin type   however it seems no difference of who you chose
besides the fighting style or type of weapon uses there is no specialty about the character type
for example celine is supposed to be a magic type
what magic
she does not have any but fights with a melee weapon like anyone else except she is slow and weakyou can learn new abilities by take on certain quests obtain at rest point  when you go to sleep
the quests are usually kill x number of certain enemies
however the developer is so cheesy and allows you to take on two quests at a time
that means you have to constantly return to the same area you had already clear multiple times to kill the right kind of enemies
then when you take the next quest only to find out that you to have to return to the same area again but this time kill different kind of enemies in which you had already done multiple time
this kind of quests can become very bored and repetitive
why not allow to take on  quests at time
so that there is no need to repeat same area again and again
i fall asleep while playing this gameweapon modification is a joke
when you found a weapon has better stat in damage but less magic thinking that you can combine with your current weapon same type with better magic and less damage to create a powerful one only to find out that you need x more than total gold you have
well now you just waste the money on the new one and cant even use it
the game has autosave when you exit the store so you cannot reload and try againin general i dont mind that the game is linear and not so much a story line or hacknslash but common dont be a cheapskates and force me to do same thing over and over again
that is pretty boringmy personal opinion despite outstanding graphics decent gameplay and easy achievements this game falls very short as far as story variety customization and originalityprosgraphics are truthfully on the level of assassins creed
need i say moregameplay was one of the better features but it was still a pretty simple and dumbed down hack n slash game
true you can dismember enemies but that offers little more than graphic pleasure
it would have been much more entertaining if maybe you could disarm enemies or even cut an arm off and have them keep fighting
i thought the bosses were pretty easy as well all you have to do really is dodge and wait for a certain button to pop up and press itin truth all you have to do to defeat the majority of enemies is mash one or two buttons again and again till they go down
also whenever your attacks land you gain energy for your charge attacks which reminded me of the musou attacks from dynasty warriorslooting is fine but nothing out of the ordinary
all you have to do is run over items that your enemies drop like health potions to obtain the
except for chests then you have to either hold or tap a buttoncons the story is about a resurrected viking who goes on a campaign to seek vengeance and reclaim his homeland from an evil greek goddess
sound a little like god of war
also the main character doesnt say one word and so you get no character development
there are also no plot twists notable supporting characters factions
nadaone of the things that i was super disappointed with is that you can never upgrade nor change your weapons
your three main weapons are your sword axe and throwing axes
also there is no armor or repairing in the gamethe only thing you can really do with the money you earn is buy health items or new combos which dont really change the game all that muchyou cant customize your character at all
no clothes haircuts or tattoos  nothingyoure always on foot
it would have been nice if you could have had the option to buy a horse or have been able to ride your dragons so you dont have to walk everywhere all the timethe missions themselves are very repetitive and lack variety
you rescue other vikings kill some traitor or kill a group of enemies to clear a locationthe enemies themselves arent anything special either there are about eight different types of enemies and each class of unit all look exactly the same as the next
the enemies you typically encounter dont have much to distinguish themselves as far as difficulty other than the fact that they have a shield or you have to hit them more times before they finally go downwhat most critics are saying that is so great about this game is the huge battles
in reality there are only  or  of them and if you try to fight the whole army youll die over and over again
the point is to take out the groups of sorcerers to stop the spawning of new troops
so its really a trick to make you think its going to be awesome when really its like dynasty warriors in the sense that all you have is take out the leaders and you win automaticallyspecifically all you have to do is rush towards and kill the sorcerers manually or use your tokens to get your dragon to kill them for you
you get these tokens for doing things like killing all the archers or killing a giantalso the objectives for these big battles never change the only thing that separates each battle from the next is the scenario and landscapelast note viking is worth the cheap price it is now on amazon of less than ten dollars but it became a real bore almost a chore to finish after few hours of playingi got this game about a month ago and have played it only once or twice
if any of you have played this in the arcade its the exact same game
i would only rent this game if i could go back and not purchase it
its a direct port from the arcade
i paid about  bucks for it and my friend and i nearly beat hotd in about  minutes
im not kidding
you could probably easily beat both games in about  or  hours
rent this game
it is not worth your money to buy it
take my advicei bought this game thinking it would be just as entertaining as resident evil the umbrella chronicles game for the wii was i ever disappointed
the main disappointment for me was the graphics while i was not expecting the greatest seeing these cheap and poorly rendered re zombie knockoffs was a joke as well as the weapons and scenery while moving around the levels of the game
the next problem i felt was the game has you play like it was the arcade version which means that you cant continue on after all the credits your characters have are used up after being killed which means after you used the four to seven credits and your character dies you have to start the game from the very beginning
the final problem was the voice actors they got for the game they were so awful i wished i could turn their voices off during game play and just read the subtitles you could tell they were just reading from their scripts with no feeling what so ever it was very sad and pathetic
you can upgrade your characters health points somewhat as well as get more credit pointswith the game extras and there are some small extras as well but i just felt that their not worth mentioning
also i have to say unlike with there umbrella chronicles game this game gives you no control of the camera angles so you cant really look around for any hidden items as much as you could with reuc  you do sometimes get to pick which direction you want to go but all in all there wont be much of a difference which way you go
so if you like shooting games for the wii and for a reasonableprice this might be for you but if you are looking for any thing else in the game i say wait for another game to come your waywhy on earth did i call this game the game of hope
keep readingviking could have been one of the coolest gamesbig bloody battles swingin axes big terrain legions of armies saving your buddies did i mention blood
in which theres aplenty
and thats about the only good thing in this gameno not the big terrain or armiesi meant the blood
id like to give this game a great reviewid love to say this game has a great fighting platformid love to say that the users manual is helpfulid like a lot of thingsbut you aint gettin nonea that from this gamepositive notegore factor in the gameawesome
as for all the runningand runningand running and more running and trying to fight  guys at a timewell that gets a bitugh
dont get me started
my god they should have named this game something else like viking the sometimes fighting quickly dying how the hell do i summon my army and much running journey to asgard because thats what this game isok you start off in your town talking  mingling then you have to venture out into other landsby running the entire timeover vast distancesand try and free your viking buddies while fighting some bad guys along the way
ok i can tolerate that but once you get to a village that holds your buddies hostage you get jumped by like  bad guys
try fighting  guys at onceyeahit doesnt work
anyone remember assassins creed
yeah theres other things in the game but nothing worth mentioninglike after you free all these guys that are tied up to posts you would think they would join you and fight by your sidenope
they run home
uh i need your help hereok i must be honest there are certain times when your viking pals actually do help youlike when you rescue your buddies that are in the cages they will help you fight but when you find guys tied to postsuh dont expect these guys to do anything except run home to momma
thats all they dorun homeas quickly as possible
now i suppose if i were held captive id run home to momma too but this is a game and they should be kicking some badguy butt right alongside youtheres something about a dragon thats supposed to help you toonot worth mentioning eitheralso youre supposed to be able to use your viking pals for help  aid in a large battleyeah rightok somebody show me how its done
theres no mention of this in the user manual i guess youre supposed to just know how to do itoh i know im supposed to use espmy brainwaves will summon my army when i need helpthe users manual doesnt say how to summon your army doesnt say what button to push doesnt say when you can do itnothingso lemme get this straight  tons of running more running getting tagteamed by  bad guys at once just like assassins creed horrible controls horrible assassins creed fighting platform lousy storysounds great
i gotta have this gameyou gotta keep going to villages trying to free your buddies while getting jumped by  guys at a time and trying to stay alive for more than  secondsand you have to do all this with the worst fighting system in the world
and talk about slow
holy crap my grandma can swing a sword faster than this idiot
she can run faster too
so i call this game the game of hopewhy hope i can figure out the controls hope i can find all the runes hope the owners manual was better hope my guy can swing a blade faster hope something cool will happen soon hope i can free these guys without getting gangjumped hope i can figure out how to get my army to help me hope i can beat  guys at a time hope i can find a horse soon so i dont run all the time hope i dont have to fight any more guys right now hope i can get my money back for the gameand thats itnothing more to report hereoh yeah
i almost forgotthe graphics are awesomesometimes this game looks really good
and the idea of making a viking game sounds amazingly promising
you have to wonder how designers could have gotten this wrong
but they did
it moves pretty slow and gets boring rather fast
its certainly not going to win any awards and will not be remembered by much of anyone
as much as you may not want to id advise you pass this one upthis game is mediocre at bestthe menus and text is too small and out of placethe ships look nice but are too balanced
a voyager like ship taking out a borg cube for examplethe main map is always the same with the same races in the same spots
while thats true to the star trek universe itd have been nice to see alternative maps or starting positions
the map itself is way too small
theres only a few indigenous species seperating playersthe combat is ok but before long you learn that traveling in a circle makes you near invinciblenot a terrible game but a sequal would do wondersthis was my second  console the first was the core system which had the rrod this one however worked for about a year then had problemsone problem i distinctly remember is whenever i would try to play a game on it it would say to play this game put it in a xbox  consoleneedless to say i sent it to microsoft and got it back in  weeksit worked fine for me for about a month then started having the same problems with it again
so i gave it away to a friend and i think he opened it and putzed around with the insides cause hes more mechanical than i in short bad buyjust a warning if you get to the extract data hub scenario and get the data extracted you must get to the exit point before turning the game off or you will be stuck
what happens is it reset to the staircase and after working your way to the hub youll find it impossible to hack the system no a button will appear to hack
you cant open the door to exit either because it thinks you havent done the hub hackgame plays ok but the constant replaying the same thing over and over was maddening and then this bug just killed the game for mei was fairly excited to play vegas  online
at first the game was exciting but after a while of play the faults of the game were just too obvious
this is without a doubt one of the most frustrating games to play online
the blame lies in both the developers and the players
ill explain the problems further belowlist of my likes and dislikes customization of your character is fun and exciting
no two players online will be the same
on top of that you can make custom faces ie
your own face to put in the game
i havent tried this feature but just the thought of being able to do so is thrilling
you can customize everything from clothing armor and camouflage
a big plus to the developers on this one
 you unlock new weapons by going through the aces
i forgot what it stands for but ill explain what it does
the aces is divided into three categories marksman assault and cqc
you add points to each categories based on how you score a kill
after so many points you gain a level up to  levels per category within the category and you can either get a new weapon or more experiences toward your overall rank
i thought this was a pretty cool idea but some of the weapons within each category make no sense
for example in the assault category you mainly score points by using explosives but yet the weapons within the category have nothing to do with explosives
 finding a match online is just flat out frustrating
the lag is nearly unbearable
it seems like the host needs a very good connection in order to host large amount of players
indeed the developers cant control this but im guessing they could at least minimize the lag by sending smaller packets
 you will get kicked and banned a lot in this game
i dont know why too
it just seems like every other game i go in results in me getting kicked or banned
i have a mic and i usually dont talk
 small maps and same respawn points
im assuming the developers made the maps so that you play one round then load another map
the problem is most game hosts use unlimited respawns which sometimes cause losing teams to be stuck at their own spawn point and unable to get out of it while the other team sits and wait for you to come out of your spawn point
you do get a  second shield which makes you invincible for about  seconds when you first respawn
problem is some people are clever enough to wait outside of the spawn point near a door such that your  second shield is gone
i would have loved the game if the developers made it smart enough to respawn at another location on the map once the other team overrun the current position
 some guns look unrealistic
for example the fs looks like it has a huge hole in the center
other ones look funny enough to me
i thought i was using a supersoaker when i first saw the moverall i liked the game
but the flaw of the respawn system and the constant kicking and banning and the unbearable lag makes the game not worthy enough for me to play online
please dont purchase for the full price
wait until it becomes  and get it then
the price and content just dont go together
you pay too much for something that seems brokenthe best way i can describe this game is extension pack
no different than the first one
as a former fan of the rainbow six series im embarrassed to say that i was a fan in the first place
ubisoft has indeed let its loyal fans down in its long awaited answer to cod with this game
as much as i hate to say it i guess rainbow might have peeked to its peek i guess its time to take ol rainbow to the back of the barn and put her out of her misery with a cod air strike
ill defiantly be returning this game back to gamestop for a real gamei bought this game yesterday
i played on and off since then between classes and a few hours at night and then this afternoon until i finished it
in less than  hours
are you serious
xbox lives popularity seems to have single handedly killed the single player game
i dont use xbox live
i dont need a  dollar paperweight
dont buy this if youre expecting an immersive detailed single player experience
the continuation of the story from the first vegas is nearly unexistant
this isnt to say that the gameplay isnt fantastic but when it ends so abruptly youd be disappointed tooi am a huge fan of the first game and this game really let me down
if you havent played the first vegas yet get that instead
you dont lose out on much from the improvements in rv and the story was much better and longeri recieved this game as a christmas gift along with a wii
having never played the wii before i was excited to try out endless ocean and was quickly bored and somewhat disapointed
im not saying endless ocean doesnt have good graphics i just am in that small minority pool of people who quickly got tired of swimming around and petting the fishi think in my case the problem is this i live in florida
i go scuba diving boating fishing
ive been on reef dives explored sunken boats swam alongside the coral and been spearfishing a couple times
i justwell i had a hard time getting a thrill out of endless ocean where i struggled at first to even float then seemed to swim in circles and see the same fish when i finally went into other areas
i literally saw humerphead wrase about a hundred and fifty gazillion timesand then i sat on my fake boat walked around it went back down pet some more fishgot bored and went to do something elsenot that the fish in the endless ocean arent sorta cool
you click on them to find out there names and info
the game just didnt keep me interested
i guess it was the lack of any real objective except swimming around an endless ocean that bored me
maybe if a shark were to come up to eat me accompanied by jaws music i would have played longer
at least when i go diving for real theres always that fear
endless ocean made me sleepy in contrasthmmwell just saying this games not for everyone
some people will get bored
others will be fascinated
ive never been the sort of person to much enjoy many museums either so this learningsea exploration game wasnt my thing but plenty will like this underwater gamei purchased this game primarily on the reviews which led me to believe id be getting a freeroaming scuba simulation with a little game tacked onreally though that isnt the case
your ability to free roam is limited to a small circular area of a few hundred square feet which you cant leave
if you want to roam further you have to move your boat which then moves the boundary to the new point
but to get the use of the boat you have to perform several tasks first  in fact to get use of several items you have to perform these tasksperhaps later in the game the boundary gets bigger  not sure
the mandatory teach your dolphin to somersault subgame turned me off so much i doubt ill returnvery disappointedat  i guess its good for a couple of hours of mindless gaming it beats watching paint dry
at least its short  to  hours for the average gameras in the first shadowground this seems like a throwback in gaming
a top down rd person shooter with horrible voice acting
felt like i was playing an arcade game circa  most cut scenes were incredibly boring and long
example you press e to open a door a long scene folows were your character walks slowly in an effeminate sort of way towards said door and opens it
thats it nothing is revealed nothing happens the cut scene ends and your wondering if you accidently hit the skip key
guess somebodys brother was in charge of cut scenes
the controls seem to be even more clunky than the first shadowgrounds
in certain areas when going around corners the character would turn toward the corner rather than following the curser
at first i thought my mouse skills were off but after playing a couple of survivor rounds it became apparent that it was a flaw in the game
a frustrating flaw when trying to shoot your way out of the undending horde of aliens this game supplies
also the character would occaionally stop moving or get stuck for no apparent reason
not being able to save during a mission is another shortcoming leave the game or die and you have to start overlike the first shadowground if this game had been released    years ago it would rate 
as it stands about on par with solitairthe good easy enough for casual players playing as different characters is fun weapon upgrades make a differencethe bad bland environments stupid story bad level layout boring aliens slow paced character upgrades are all the same doesnt look very goodshadowgrounds was a pretty doesnt shooter a few years ago but survivor doesnt really do much new and is pretty boring
as a top down shooter you play as a marine who is trying to escape a ruined base that is overrun by aliens
the weapons are pretty generic with shotguns assault rifles flamethrowers grenades etc
you can pick up health packs ammo and ok you know this formula alreadyunlike other better shooters like alien shooter the game doesnt even offer intense moments
there are a few straggling aliens coming after you and maybe a few hard ones and thats it
you can easily kill these guys and it doesnt feel very satisfying at all
you can shoot barrels toss grenades or just run around holding the fire button and youll beat these guys
ammo is plentiful so you never feel like youre surviving and its pretty hard to diethere is an upgrade system that you use by finding parts and when you level up you can use points for different upgrades like sonar health boosts etc and each character you play has the same upgrades
thats pretty lame
while each character has a different load out theres just nothing exciting about it at all
the game is fun however since its good for more casual players who dont like the intensity of other top down shooters but even the aliens are generic looking
instead of creepy deformed things you just get typical bug like aliensthe game doesnt look or sound too good either and the music almost seems non existent while the game looks pretty bland
the level design is also pretty bad since i wandered around areas and didnt know where to go like shooting a glass panel to open a walkway
there is no hint the panel doesnt even light up or flash
so this is bad level design and the whole freaking game just feels boring
the game is a little fun if youre bored or just want a decent top down shooterwell it is hard not to compare this with the much loved computer based versions
yes they have in the description that this console version was written from the ground up so that does provide an excuse
so to be fair all i will say is that this version is nothing like the computer version
it has very few similarities at best and the game play is very different
they obviously made this for the casual gamer
serious gamers will think this version is a joketo call this a next generation game would be an insult
the graphics are subpar at best and is really nothing better than you might see on the wii console
i am not knocking the wii i am just providing a comparison
this console version also lacks the many wonderful musical scores from the pc versionthey have animated characters guiding your way through the game
they all speak in gibberish that gets very annoying the longer you play
again the graphics for these characters are bad for a next gen consolethe victory options are nonexistent
in fact there are hardly any game optionsi dont know
when comparing to the pc version i could beat this version up all day and write a novel
this is going to be good for the civ novice that has never played the pc version or maybe thought the pc version was too hard to play
however they at least could have done much better on the graphics and sound if the  price tag is to be justified
this costs more than the pc version and you get so much lessbeing a long time fan of civilization i was looking forward to a console port
this version of the civilization franchise was a quick fix but ultimately suffers from reduced game mechanics and simplicitythe good graphics are fantastic
love this simplified direction
 sounds are simstyle grunts  all around the sounds are very nicely done
 quick to get intothe bad dumbed down game play leaves very little in the way of strategy
this feels very much like an arcade port
 very little customization  you can only choose the countryleader you want map land age all those settings we are used to in civ games are removed
 map size singular is incredibly small
 where as i remember taking over a week or two on a really nice civ  game id be amazed if anyone takes longer than a couple of hours on one of these
 ai has two modes wait and destroy
there is no real negotiating besides giving your stuff to them on demand or going to war on refusalif you are new to the civ franchise and felt like you hadnt had the time or attention to get into the previous incarnations then this game might be a good choice for you
for an experienced civ gamer its more of a disappointment than anythingi just cant understand what people see in this game
the cartoonish environment is fun for about  minutes
the empty quests of go here get this bring it there is incredibly monotonous
the infinite slight variations of weapons is just annoying
why would anyone play thisif you like civilization you will like this maybe even love it but dont get your hopes up this isnt much more than a port of the pc version of the game
the biggest drawback is the game play was not significantly improved for use with a console controller its a bit awkward and ineffective to more around the map and move troops
the game was also full of graphical glitches this was truly unacceptable it also ran surprisingly slow
very annoying
the graphics were ok and i expected much better for a ps game
the sound design could have been better as well the more i write this review the more i realize how many issues i had with the gamei bought this after playing the demo thinking the full game would have more to it campaigns with specific goals historical storylines etc
how sadly i was disappointed to learn that the full game differs from the demo in only one regardthe game doesnt end after a set number of turns
there is no replay value in this game for people like me who like storylines and campaignsnot nearly up to the standards of the original civilization computer game
the same moves are available and the battles are similar but the screen size is so tiny it is impossible to tell which are the good guys and which are the bad guys once you have played awhile
everything is way too compressedi think i was hoping for a degree of realism in the gameplaygeographygeopolitical area
its simply not there
you only play against three or four of the other civilizations at any given time which limits the diversity of the experience when replaying the gamethis was my first and last experience with the civilization franchisegame kept telling me there were more jobs but i could not find them
found plenty but not somegame showed things on the radar map in places where they were not
gun parts and bounty boardsi could not finish due to these problems plus it was impossible for me to defeat some enemies thus the job even though i was at a higher level then themone of the bad games i got glade i bought it used because if i got it new i would be upset but i still play it when i am waiting for a new game to play then i put it awayi have always loved first person shooters halo killzone gears of war modern warfare socom etc
something about this game bothered me i didnt like the feel to it at all
it really bothered me that when i shot someone it gave damage numbers above their heads to me thats not very cool the look and feel is well unique
i would describe it as the game looks like someone drew all of it
i would not recommend this game but a lot of people do like it so i definatly recommend watching some game play on youtube first since its free through ps i downloaded before looking it upwhen i first heard of the concept behind borderlands i immediately got excited about the prospect of playing a cooperative roleplayinggame online with a good friend
in the gaming press more than one passing comparison was made between borderlands and diablo diablo with guns
was one term used
being a huge fan of diablo my anticipation for borderlands only grewas soon as the game was released a good friend and i purchased our copies and jumped online for some coop goodness
for the first  hours i loved borderlands but after that the shortcomings started becoming more and more apparenti guess the most major issue i have with this game is that there is a paperthin story
this is something that may not bother some but being a fan of rpgs it most definitely bothered me
youll find yourself in the role of one of four selectable mercenaries on a remote planet called pandora
pandora in essence is a horrible place to live and was only colonized in order to mine mineral deposits
its soon discovered that theres very little of value on the planet and most settlers with the means to do so simply leave the planet
those that are left eek out a living mad max style
bandits run amok in the wasteland as do feral creatures known as skaggs and a few more enemy typesthere are some alien ruins which rumor has it hold some sort of incredible power
thats why you find yourself on pandora investigating those alien ruins
each of the four characters specializes in different things
mordocai is a hunter class character who specializes in sniper rifles and best suited to engaging enemies from afar
brick is a berserker and serves as the games tank character specializing in close range combat
lilith is a siren and the games only female character
her specialty is small arms and speed
finally roland is the games soldier class specializing in machine guns
each character also features a special ability  mordecai for example can use his pet eagle bloodwing to attack enemies
roland can deploy a shielded sentry turret for taking down swarms of bad guys
each character features their own skill trees and as you level up you can assign points in the skill tree to increase damage accuracy gain new abilities and inflict elemental damage
the upgrade system is pretty generic stuff that has been done in games before
the main problem with the characters and leveling system is that eventually every character feels exactly the same outside of their respective special attacks
so while you may start out playing mordecai as a sniper youll eventually discover that hes just as good using a machine gun rocket launcher or revolverthat leads to other problems with the game
because every class is a jack of all trades playing online devolves into mindless shoot everything as fast as you can matches
also because borderlands doesnt feature much of a storyline and relies heavily on sidequests much of the game becomes a mindless shooting gallery
go to town x speak with character y go to location z and retrieve item q
rinse and repeat over and over and over again
its mindless and while initially fun it gets old quickthere are boss battles in the game which couldve been so much more
the boss battles are ultimately mindless run backward while blasting away affairs
its funny that a gameplay mechanic perfected in doom so many years ago is still being used in modern games like borderlandsthe other much touted element of borderlands that was much touted before release is the looting
spread everywhere throughout the game is chests containing various types of guns and modifiers for your guns
the problem is that  of the stuff you find is garbage thats only purpose is to be sold in towns for money
much of the game is simply spent running from chest to chest looting what you can carry tossing less valuable items and moving to a town to sell those items
occasionally youll stumble on a rare item which is actually worth equipping
again the entire system is dull monotonous and repetitivethere are a few things about borderlands that merits praise
the graphics art style is cellshaded which im a fan of
the game is colorful and bright
the environments are significantly varies while maintaining a central theme
gearbox did a fantastic job rendering the world of pandora
if only they had made it an interesting placethe online coop is definitely the games saving grace
its always fun to play online with a good friend cracking jokes  even if it is at the games expensetechnically there are some glitches in the game
there are some well publicized trophy issues  mainly the game not awarding trophies when it should
additionally there are display glitches with the game where parts of the sky start to flash big blocky pixels of various colors
another big issue was that that the game was resetting a characters stat level midway through after saving
so for example if i were playing as mordecai and my sniper rifle level was midway through level  and i saved and quit the game
the next time i started a session my sniper rifle level would be reset to the beginning of level  wiping out a lot of progress
problems like these are extremely frustrating particularly the leveling glitchall in all borderlands will be loved by those that can overlook the games many many problems and focus solely on the fun of the coop element
to others i would strongly recommend buying fallout  instead or getting a real rpg or just regular fps
borderlands is a rental at besti dont get the hype for this game
its repetitive simple and boringmoreover ive never seen so many reskinned weapons before playing this game
its junk
purchased on january  it was lots of fun for the first  days
not as noisy as i thought it would be
great gameplay
then the dvd player died
misty softies turnaround time on this was  months but amazon kindly took it back as defectivei picked up a copy of borderlands on steam when it was on sale because of the fairly decent reviews
in terms of gameplay i was expecting a fusion of fps and rpg level grinding and thats pretty much what i got
unfortunately it felt like pure level grinding with no purpose aside from increasing the numbers in your character stats screensmy main gripes are that the game gives you very little sense of purpose and no sense of accomplishment unless you enjoy obsessively finishing quests and gaining more experiencemoneystatsnumberslooti played for about five hours and only ran into two soulless human npcs who gave me quests and they felt exactly like the electronic jobs posting board that also gave me quests
a quick google search reveals that the game only has about  or so npcs including boss characters who say a few lines of dialog before you kill them
also all of the merchants are actually just vending machines that regularly update with newer weapons and shield units
without any remotely compelling dialog or characters i felt no sense of purpose aside from checking off another quest from my quest listthe game promises a ton of guns and you definitely get lots and lots of guns but since youre constantly getting slightly better loot theres really no feeling of accomplishment
after you beat a boss youll get a new gun but within a few minutes youll find a slightly better one on your next quest
the game rewards you so frequently with loot that it very quickly becomes meaninglessconstantly upgrading your guns is important though because the enemies in the wastelands endlessly respawn
crates and chests also constantly refill with more stuff
no matter how many times you clear out an area the enemies will always respawn and crates will always refill again giving you no sense of accomplishmentif you really really enjoy games that offer tons of level grinding then you might love borderlands
if youre expecting anything even slightly deeper than endless grinding then youll probably find borderlands to be incredibly boringborderlands is an rpgbased first person shooter set in a postapocalyptic wasteland
however the seemingly promising combination of genres doesnt result in a particularly fun gamein borderlands you play as one of four characters  the hunter mordecai the siren lilith the soldier roland or the berserker brick
each has his or her own special abilities and basically serve as the games classes
mordecai can use his pet bird to attack enemies lilith can turn invisible and apply elemental damage to weapons roland can deploy a sentry turret with upgradable weapons and bonuses and brick relies mostly on his brute strength and power
at the beginning of the game you pick one of these four as the game goes on you can level up certain abilities which serves as the games only real stab at customization
you can also change the colors of your character model but the characters costumes are so quirky and wacky that it still never really feels like your character  just like youve painted someone elses characterthe games main draw is the wide range of weapons which includes the usual mix of pistols rifles smgs and shotguns
however individual weapons can have different bonuses and penalties  damage ammo capacity scope range bonus effects like fire or acid and so on
this is meant to be the games rpg element
however rather than being an interesting way to carry out different missions each gun basically has you do the same backpedal and shoot tactic no matter what you do
theres no variety in the weapons  just in how long it takes before something falls down while you shoot at itthe grenades are a little better but not much
rather than getting different actual grenades you get equipped with an item that turns your grenades into different grenades
these include sticky grenades bouncing grenades and teleporting grenades
even these though are just regular grenades in fps terms
theres nothing that actually changes the way you play the gameas far as gameplay goes its basically diablo or world of warcraft except with guns
shoot things level up shoot higherlevel things level up shoot even higherlevel things level up
in addition to your guns damage your actual character somehow does more damage per shot by leveling up
this would make sense with say swords which are driven by strength but with guns its just kind of dumb
the games bizarre attempt to be an rpg is really just kind of annoying  it boils down to how much damage you do per shot to things of various levels
things far lowerlevel than you cant really hurt you even if they get the drop on you while things higherlevel than you just need to hit you once with their normal patterns
things dont get more difficult they just have bigger numbers
the entire game is basically a cycle with no appreciable gameplay differences apart from the skills you buy
the game is on the whole motivated by quests like any other rpg but they just serve as periodic rewards to move the game along since its not like you can go around not doing quests  theyre the things that open up new areasthe games other main draw is coop which is at least a reasonably good idea
however its difficult to say that its a good game because of coop  rather the coop feels kind of irritating because you have to be at a similar level to your coop comrades to get anything done
its usually best to start a bunch of new characters all at the same time so everyones the same level but thats also really annoying
coop is much more frantic than singleplayer and its harder to maintain the simple dodge attacks shoot enemy gameplay when theres four people and the enemies are going for all of them
there are some bits that are made more fun with multiple people like the usual halostyle jeeps with a driver and gunner but these are few and far betweenon the whole playing borderlands was more of an annoyance than anything
the guns arent responsive enough to be fun the screen is often crowded by the headsup display especially in multiplayer and despite the tight linear maps youre required to go back and forth to places to turn in quests
the celshaded graphics are kind of neat and the gun sounds are pretty good but mostly everything in the game is bland and basically a huge grind
if youre willing to subject yourself to huge amounts of grinding for no real gain then you might be fine with borderlands
however for either casual players who want to move through things quickly or hardcore players who want to actually get some results for their skills borderlands isnt a particularly great gamerating everything others have said about this game is true
id like to keep playing it but the browser is the worse ever
it like they never have seen a modern browser
i know there are players out there but i cant find them
what a wastethe single player is great
fun compelling well designed from a visual aspect
but i bought the game to play with  other friends
thats the big thing about this game is the coop
and that part is broken
seriously the architecture of the game makes it near impossible to play unless you open all your ports reset almost everything and then its a  in  chance that itll even work
the in game voice options dont seem to exist so youll have to use vent or ts
you have to use vlans just to play the game for the most part
in other wordsyou may have to use other programs to play this game
ridiculousoh yeah and it doesnt support many gpus when in slicrossfire configuration for me two gts
youll get a bsod about  min into the game if you dont turn that off
happened to me about  times before i figured it out
im not a big fan of having to turn sli off creating worse graphics in the game i want to play then turning it back on again anytime i want to play games that this works perfectly well onconsisting of every other game i own
there doesnt seem to be any patch of this in sight
ive yet to find the creators of this gamegearbox owning up to the incompetence
why didnt they just let a third party who knows what they are doingsay valve maybein on the action so they could have a game that works multiplayer coop
simply put i will never buy a product that has the gearbox emblem on it again
i just dont trust themoh yeah and they use gamespy for the multiplayer
what were they thinkingi am playing it because it is the only worthy street racing game in this  years
why  stars
well this game is extremely difficult i have played racing games for long time and by far this is the most difficult one it is frustrating
the last street game that i have enjoyed is need for speed carbon after that all these games have been pretty badi bought this game after reading the reviews and thought i would give it a shot
just finished playing it for a lil while and allready tired of it
i really do regret buying this game
if your a fan of the need for speed series i wouldnt go with this game
tottaly diff
the ppl walkn around are dumb
the cockpit cam is funny
the junk cars they force you to start out with omg etc etc etcif you must i would suggest you pick up a used copy and save yourself some cashmaybe my copy would be a lil more fun as a chew toy for my dog
i think he might enjoy itmy mistake for expecting too much out of this game
i am into more sim style racing games so this game really isnt aimed at me
if you like arcade style smashm up type of games
this may be for youi got this game for christmas
i got it for free as part of a buy two get one free deal
luckily the other two games i acquired were rock band  and fallout   i say luckily because with midnight club i basically got what i paid forim not going to go into a lot of detail here because there isnt a lot of game to detail
midnight club really set the bar high with dub edition in terms of vehicle customization
it set the bar slightly higher with la
no other game comes close to the level of customization allowed by midnight club
were talking little things like the license plates of every state in the us and the ability to raise and lower convertible tops while driving  as in you dont have to pause and access menu options or return to the garage etcunfortunately that is the best part of midnight club la
and believe me  i tried to like it
i went into the options and created custom control layouts  of course you can only do this for manual shifting  you have to use a preset for automatic driving
why
i mean i love manual shifting  in games that have realistic driving physics like forza or gran turismo
mcla is another one of those games that blips the throttle to try and generate moviestyle sound effects
you never do that in a real car
so when you try to drive manually it just sucksof course these games are also built to favor drifting
but the drifting is terrible
my little frontwheel drive car drifts forever  i cant stop the drift and it forces me to take everwidening corners just to compensate for how long the car will slide
this causes me to get passed by the ai opponentsand youll get passed a lot because of the rubber banding
youll get to first place quickly but youll never stay there
fall behind and the other cars make more mistakes
pull ahead and they become impeccable drivers
and as you acquire better cars and better parts itll eventually get to the point that you cant win anything anymore
the difficulty ramps up so high that it becomes unplayable
opponents simply level up with you using better cars with better parts
essentially buying better cars is useless
all youre doing is keeping up with the curvethe driving physics  as already touched upon above  are simply terrible
cars dont act like real cars act
and believe me  i know how real cars act
this review is written by the proud owner of a dodge viper gts coupe
ive been on tracks ive raced competitively
midnight club is an arcade game and nothing from mcla translates correctly into the real world
your car will bounce off of some impacts with other vehicles or walls
other impacts  more severe ones  launch you into a unwelcomed cutscene which shows your car spinning out of control and always  and i do mean always  ending up  degrees from your original direction of travel
i dont think its chance  i think this sequence is intentionally used to pivot your car around as some sort of punishment for hitting another car
it becomes insanely frustrating and often results in me deciding to play something elsemidnight club gives us the ability to create oneofakind automobiles that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the real world
but once youve built that car you really wont have any interest in driving itif youre a kid who thought the fast  furious movies were totally awesome then youll love midnight club
if you watched fast  furious and laughed most of the time i would recommend titles like forza motorsports or gran turismoi read really good things about this game so i decided to check it out but i wasnt very impressed
the game is essentially gtaiv but you cant kill people or steal carsi like that they were able to capture the whole city but i think that the graphics suffer due to the vastness of the gameeverything happens at night so its not so much racing as it is just trying to dodge the headlights coming at you and figure out where youre goingits really easy to hit something and get spun around and have to start from scratch in the race with your horrible car and awful acceleration
all the people you race against have cars  times better and they never make mistakes so you have to drive almost perfect to win raceseven when you do win the races the amount of money you get is too small compared to the prices of the newer cars and specs unless youre awesome at this game it takes forever to get a car thats worth drivingalso the cops start chasing you at least  of the times that you race and after the race is over they keep chasing you and forget about the five people you were racing against
since the amount of the fine for running from the cops is based off of how long the chase was by the end of the race you end up having to give the city  which is most likely more money than you got from the raceso youre back at square one
and after you finish a race and the game goes to the results screen it cuts right back into the action after youve seen the resultsthis means your car starts going  mph all of a sudden in an intersection after youve fogotten what you were doingi guess this game is good if you like squinting and racing again and again and again with the same stupid dialogue to try and get more cars or if you like being beaten again and again in the face with a hammeri guess im biased because i didnt think gtaiv was that great and this uses the same engine so its basically the same game
i was expecting ridiculous graphics since they say that every vehicle used  million polygons but good luck trying to see anything
youre moving too fast and its dark so i had trouble appreciating the beauty and the sounds of the engine were almost identical on every vehicle to memaybe i just suck at racing games but in my opinion this game is not worth the money and i dont understand how so many people can like itsave some money and get one of the older racing titles that cost half as muchthis game is a prototypical open world action game with a lackluster story worse then average graphics bland combat a terrible targeting system and less then  hours of semicompelling gameplaywow that sounded harsh but ill try to explain everything the best i can in this review
let me start by saying that i am completely unbias towards any productgame and my goal is to help inform you of the product before you purchase it
if you really want to buy this game by all means go out and get it now or order it now
if youre looking for an honest opinion from someone who loves games and has played through it then im going to do my best to inform youlets start by saying that the concept of the story seems like it would be great for this game
you play as alex mercer who wakes up in a morgue and discovers that he has strange superherolike powers and that manhattan is becoming infested with mutation
the intro to the game is decent as it begins with a tutorial showing you the basic controls as you are fully powered up
then all those powers are taken away from you which i felt was stupid
as you complete missions throughout the game and do other actions you gain ep evolution points which can be used to purchase new powers and upgrades
thats fine but they teach you the controls of the game with all the powers then take them away and you are left knowing how to do something but do not have the ability to do it anymorethe story of the game is not at all interesting and i think its because of the way that the story is told
there are two main ways of storytelling in the game
first there are cut scenes before and sometimes after each mission
these are cg not using the ingame engine thank god but they still look pretty terrible
the voice acting is downright terrible
i found myself wanting to skip each scene and just get onto the next boring mission but watched them just in case something interesting was shown
the other way the story is told is through a mechanism the game calls the web of intrigue
every time alex consumes one of the web targets a small collage of events is played which is supposed to give you more story information through each persons memories
i got absolutely nothing in these brief  second scenes and actually skipped these towards the end of the game because they all seemed to be random
the game doesnt control the entire order that they are displayed so it can really screw things upthe gameplay can actually be fun once you gain certain upgrades and get a handle on the frustrating controls
its hard for me to pinpoint what makes this game so frustrating its a mixture of the controls and targeting system and the terribly cheap ai
the targeting system is the only way to aim projectiles and powers and is pretty bad at detecting the most threatening enemy on screen
for example there may be a foot soldier tank and hunter in your screen and you would think the foot soldier would be the last priority to target right
wrong according to this game
the game also likes to throw multiple types of enemies at you and spawn them infinitely until you take out a specific target
couple that with the targeting system and add in enemies being able to interrupt each attack and evade move that you have and you can see how this game can be very frustrating
i was only playing on normal i cant imagine sitting through a hard difficulty settinglike i mentioned before the graphics are terrible
they display little to no detail the textures are bland every part of the city looks the same except times square
the frame rate is mostly steady except when there is a ton going on
on the plus side there is no loading throughout the city and you can scale any building to the top and jump down which is pretty exhilarating  but with games that look great in this setting gta iv this game might as well be on ps or the original xboxthis is a single player game only which is a bummer since they had planned coop originally
there are  story missions and they all feel exactly the same
then there are side missions which dont interfere with the story and are equally as boring except with no point other then gaining experience
i played through the game with minimal side missions in about    hours and then had no need to go back and play it againi know this is probably the most harsh review i have ever written but i did have some fun just wandering the city and destroying things
jumping and climbing up buildings can be fun for a while but this game had a lot of hype and ultimately fell flat on its face
i suggest a rental or wait until the price comes down it simply isnt worth the moneyjddoes anybody even play this anymore
i remember when it was a huge hit
now everything is xbox connect and ps
i thought it was fun for the first hour or so trying to beat the song until finally just putting in the cheat code and unlocking it all
the story mode where you do diff concert was fun though
not so much fun years later when its been sitting in my room not getting played
dont buyi purchased this wheel cuz the description stated it worked with all game platforms and i have a wii
when i received it and read the instructions this wheel only will work with downloaded virtual games for the wii with use of the classic controller
needless to say i sent it backupdated february 
 this thrustmaster ferrari in wheel was my second try at getting going on computer racing
the genius wheel had not worked except for vibrating but using the thrustmaster i was able to get rolling
however the up shifter has broken after two months my earlier review had expressed uncertainty on the durability
the wheel has accurate steering on the gtr evolution game i purchased from amazon recommended
after logging in around  hours of racing the up shifter broke
i have now switched the up gear shifting to a button which is a little awkward to reach while trying to shift quickly
the wheel was not compatible with need for speed shift that i also ordered
even after adjusting the steering sensitivity to  the best the shift game would do was to have the car zigzag slowly on the trackget gtr evolution
i tried to treat the wheel gently within reason and the shifter still broke
thrustmaster says it has a two year warranty
i havent sent it back yet to check out the coverage
since i prefer appliances that dont break i have now purchased a used logitech wheel advertised as like new
ill see how that goesokay lets get out of the way that this is not a wii controller its a gamecube controller and the only wiis that it will work with are the ones that have gamecube controller ports
if you are considering getting this for a wii make sure that wii has gcn controller ports new wiis dont have themby design i dont mean the shape of the controller or the placement of the buttonsdpadsticks i mean the way its built
it feels really cheap even for a thirdparty controller the buttons are terribly clunky and the dpad is unresponsive when its not perfectly centered
also probably worth noting is that the lr buttons can feel unresponsive as well thats because they are pressuresensitive but also built mostly like digital buttons and most gamecube games dont respond at the slightest touch of the l and r triggersthis is really unfortunate because no one else makes a controller that lets you customize the buttons input
the idea is great because some games have really awkward andor just plain uncomfortable button setups so if this thing wasnt so terribly designed it would be the ideal controller to have
if you already have one and it happens to be good consider yourself extremely lucky and dont get rid of it because any replacement is bound to disappoint youive had this controller for a while
i dont like it and heres why you need  aaa batteries for it
if you have a wiimote that comes with the wii spend the extra  to get the wii classic controller pro which wont require extra batteries and plugs into the wiimote and works like it should
youll have a much better controller and youll save money from having to buy extra batteries the extra buttons that you wouldnt find on other controllers are completely useless and if accidentally pressed during gameplay will mess up your gameim referring to turbo slow and map sometimes during play the controller acts up putting you out of control of the game youre in
this is remedied temporarily of course by turning the power button of the controller on and off but you should never have this problem with a controllercontroller  control  ler less expensive replacementi would never buy this one againive read a lot of reviews here at amazon about battlefield bad company and im surprised at how many positive reviews this game hasi purchased bfbc in july  after playing the excellent demo on the playstation network
ive had over  months to play the game and in that time serious issues have not been addressed by the developer  dice studios or electronic arts the publisher of the gamethe battlefield series has always been first and foremost an online shooter
bfbc is different in  ways
first it adds a single player campaign and second it features destructible environments
the single player campaign is adequate though somewhat of a distraction from the meat of the game which is clearly the online portionthe single player campaign puts you in the boots of a us army soldier assigned to the proverbial bsquad
your squad consists of delinquents hasbeens and allaround rejects from the rest of the army
youll have various objectives to accomplish in the warzone youre in before being allowed to go home
the story although not compelling is entertaining and the ai characters are actually funny in parts
all in all i used the single player campaign as practice before jumping onlineand online is where the game has major problems
first and foremost a game like bfbc is all about squad communication and tactics
inexplicably the game features very very poor voice chat support
you are limited to only speaking with members of your immediate squad  players total
you have no way of communicating with other members of different squads even on the same team
coordinating attacks or defense is severely limited because of it
also even through various game updates the voice chat is hopelessly broken
some rounds you might actually get lucky and have the voice chat work only to discover it wont in the nextas if that werent bad enough bfbc does not run stably or reliably online
lag is so severe that the game sporadically freezes for  seconds at a time
try playing a shooter with lag this severe and youll quickly realize that its a futile effortother problems including a complete lack of online game modes also hamper the game
initially bfbc only included one game mode  gold rush
its essentially a spin on traditional sabotage games
you are either a defender or attacker and must either destroy or defend crates of gold
a few months after release bfbc was updated with a new game mode called conquest
in conquest mode the aim is to reduce the opposing teams tickets to zero
killing an enemy soldier depletes one ticket per kill while capturing control points on the map causes enemy tickets to count downbeyond those problems i am also disappointed in the level variety in bfbc
some levels truly shine and feature enough variety in vehicles and terrain to cater to all types of combat
other levels are claustrophobic poorly planned feature no vehicles and are layered in annoying fog
the feeling i get playing the latter is that the developer quickly padded the game with extra maps sacrificing quality for quantityi should point out that i tried resolving the various lag and voicechat issues through eas technical support
unfortunately for me it seems that its the game itself that is at fault as no one from ea was able to offer any viable solution
ill also add that i use a broadband mbsec
connection from comcast
i play several other games online with no problems on the same ps
it seems like the issues are entirely contained within the game itselfoverall i am of course disappointed with the game
what should have been the blockbuster title of the summer fizzled out as many players experiencing the same problems i described above have left for better games
the support from ea and dice to bfbc has been almost nonexistent leaving many gamers with an almost unplayable game
i strongly encourage anyone to rent this game before purchasing itheres the dealthis game has a few things going for itit is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings
i am also a big fan of shooting the trees down
the single player has some moments that are kind of funny
the graphics are not on par with the great shooters but they are still pretty goodmy complaints with the game are as followsok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking  mph  mph if i am sprinting
the graphics are not all that great
the controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate
some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid
like the injector that heals you which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself
this wouldnt be so bad if i wasnt using the damn thing every  seconds
also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again
whats the point of that
if you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again
also the multiplayer sucks blow up gold crates whatever
i hear they are releasing new modes but who cares when the game play is this badanyways maybe i am just spoiled from halo and cod
but it feels like they rushed this game out
i recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fallnot a bad game i played it and sent it to a friend who also played it it was a decent gamei am and have been a razer gaming mouse fan for several years
i have owned a few diamond backs and have been very pleased with their reliability and accuracy  so i thought the lachesis would be an upgrade to my diamond backthis mouse did have great speed and adjustability on the fly but there were more negative features than positive
i found that the side buttons were way too stiff to push especially the side opposite my thumb the ergonomics was not a good fit for my hand and worst was that the middle scroll button did not work when pushed down for activating a command ie scope zoom not good at all for fps gamingi had to return this mouse for a refund because of this nonfunctional button
i am back to my diamond back g
i can not recommend the lechesis at this time when this game came out i waited a game as castlevania curse of darkness but the truth is that it is very short the graph is poor the camera changes are really bad there are occasions in those that you are not able to see for where you go or where you attack and the cinema display is not so good lastly the use of the wiimote to carry out the attacks is very good but alone this available one in coliseum mode and not in the way it risks that bad
if they waited a game with a similar quality to castlevania you will be disappointedi was quite excited to play this game when i first purchased it
i remember when rygar went to d on the playstation  and it was a pretty fun game with some limitations in combat and platforming but funso when i put in the new rygar to my disappointment i realized the only this new in this game is that they reskinned rygar keeping the game the exact same from the ps version
this had potentialtoo bad it was just a portrygar the battle of argus is actually a reissue of the rygar game released on the playstation  a few years ago
admittedly i didnt play the original ps release
unfortunately rygar for the wii doesnt come close to perfection
what we end up having is another game ported to the wii thats given motion sensor controls and the end result isnt exactly the besttheres not much of a story in rygar and so it doesnt really merit much mentioning
its a little convoluted and disorganized leaving you with lots of burning questions that dont exactly get answered
its not a very long game one that can be completed in one or two sittings and yet for a story that shouldve been simple its needlessly complicated based on how much it doesnt tell you more so than how much it does
luckily most of us wont be picking up rygar for its storylinetheres nothing really complex about rygar
you swing a shield like weapon known as a diskarmor at enemies killing just about anything that moves
you can pull off several combos if you want but for the most part its a fairly button mashing affair
you can waggle the wii remote as well but its something that feels tacked on rather than flowing very well
for the most part you dont actually need any motion sensor controls
unless youre going to play in gladiator mode where you must waggle the wii remote to pull off some attacks
but it quickly becomes repetitivelevel design also suffers slightly because of issues that shouldnt have been such a big deal even for a game released previously in   the first being that the camera angles just arent that good
navigating the game can sometimes be painful because you cant control the camera
not only do you have cameras shifting strangely but the jumping moments can be a little tough because you might mess up thanks to the fixed camera
its an issue that probably wouldnt have been too hard to fix
just the same its amazing how quickly the games sinks into being repetitive
its not hard to take down most of your adversaries including some bosses
its just too simplethe visuals arent exactly anything to get excited about either
even if the game were originally released in  it doesnt exactly look like a great ps game either
which means it doesnt look like a great wii game either
a lot of the textures are bland and boring and theres a bit of clipping to contend with not to mention some all around fuzzy moments
its very rare when a game actually needs a visual upgrade when being reissued but rygar mightve benefited more from it
its not a horrible looking game by any means its just a game that doesnt showcase the technology of either the ps or wiithe game doesnt exactly sound that good either
by that i mean the voice acting which sounds horrible
the music itself isnt quite so bad but its not the most memorable youll hear eitherits a shame that rygar couldnt have been a better game
it has a lot of inspiration going for it
but the repetitive overly simple combat tacked on motion sensor controls and bad storyline dont help rygar out
it may have been originally released in  but even then its a game that didnt really seem to fair too well
i suppose if you enjoyed it on the ps theres no reason you wont enjoy it on the wii
on the other hand its a game that just cant stack up to the games it tries so hard to emulate
you might get a little bit of fun out of it but it can only last for so longi like fps games while this doesnt advertise like one i still found it  hours in redundant and only ok on the fun meter
its not scary at all more frustrating as the guy moves so slow to run andor turn around to fight
and the whole must shoot off limbs every time gets kinda old fast
maybe ill try dead space  or  instead but those look to be similarokay i can understand why some people might rave about this game because the graphics are really really pretty and might be a bit overwhelming
but one you start playing i dont see how anyone could give this game an aboveaverage or even average rating
the controls for the main character are clunky the d mapping leaves a lot to be desired and the weapons controls are pretty unimpressive
the plot itself is uninspired and involves the following formula a walk down creepy corridor b kill eventhorizon ripoff critter c emerge into a lab d repeat step b multiple times e move something with your mind f go back to the beginning g go to next level h repeats previous steps
seriously this is one of the most linear games ive ever seen and i was completely bored with it after just a couple of hourswas actually contemplating purchasing this game
glad i didntthis game probably looked good on paperbut just didnt translate
i found it repetitive and boring at timesand way too difficult there was one part that was the deciding factor on me sending it back
it literally was impossible for me too do
i attempted it at least  times before packaging it back up in an infuriated ragei wanted to give this game a chance i really didbut the game was just not cooperating with mepeople might disagree with me and thats okay
lets just say this game is not of my tasteid been holding off buying dead space for a while  the demo on xbl really didnt showcase the game for me at all and i felt the way the main character was always to the left of the screen seemed odd but since it was now at budget level pricepoint i thought why notwell ill tell you why not this game is a huge let down
true the graphics and sound really convey the feel of a futuristic damaged vessel teaming with mutated life forms
special credit has to be given to the lighting and background audio  it all works really well and i also liked the totally functional but minimal hud
you feel like ripley must have felt at the end of alien  never knowing whats around the corner
fabulous atmosphereas with the demo the main character always being to the left still is strange sure i realise this is so you can see whats in front of you but sometimes you need to see whats on the left of the screen and you cant
a part where you are dodging asteroids on the hull of the ship totally showed how flawed the guy on the left mechanic was see batman arkham asylum for a great example of how to deal with this thoughat first i was totally getting into the game everything was thrillingly spooky and downright made me jump initially
but drudgery soon kicked in as i discovered that its just a case of go to room x press button y then return to room z nothing really changes as you progress in the game except when silly minigames are placed in front of you or quick time events pop up presumably to break up the monotony
the mandatory defend your ship from asteroids was the breaking point for me  seriously it played and looked like a flash game
and bad guys pop out at such frequency that they know longer hold a surprise
their constant boo mammy appearances become so predictable it loses its spark very quickly and clearly a very basic ai is covered by cheap scares
other frustrating parts of the game didnt help  no ability to jump seriously
and why do futuristic space suits only manage to have  seconds of breathable air
laughable reallyi loved system shock   truly a scary game for its time but the only thing i found scary in dead space was how boring it all quickly becamefirst let me say that i triedi really tried to play this game in order to see what everyone else saw
i had heard such great things about this game that i just couldnt pass it up but the only experience i got was boredomi dont know what it is but i found this game pretty boringthe only true frustration i encountered was using the melee attacks
it seems like only  of my stomps  punches registeredmost would say that this is what resident evil  should have been like  all i can say is no waydead space never had me wanting more or made my heart race although the first stage did surprise me it was all down hill from theresadly i only endured until the middle of chapter  until i finally decided i needed something moreeven at  bucks i cant bring myself to purchase it the intro screen is so cheapgood survival horrors are hard to find nowadays
havent seen a good one since resident evil  umbrella chronicles seriously is fun but hardly a survival horror
so when i saw the review of dead space on tv i was very intrigue
lucky enough a friend of mine got it so decided to try itshe showed me the beginning and intros of the game and of course the system and mechanic
i was really impressed by what ea has done to this game from what i saw and tried
last time i was impressed by this shameless franchise update churning factory was when queen victoria was ruling britain
anyway back to the game
the parameters was sort of like alien so you have extraterrestrial organisms attacking you while you are in an isolated space when attempting to change a desolated planet into a home suitable for humans
to survive you must thread through the space station and complete all the missions before time runs out or life runs outgraphics wise its brilliant
very detail and excellent light and shadow effects
also they use the light effect to the games advantage to give you a scary edge
the controls are very well balanced but strategic  you have to cut off your enemies limbs to stop them from getting back up
the dismembered bodies will roll around and follow you in the space though
so to save ammo you will need to do precise surgery on your enemies
lucky enough you got some kinesis power to slow fast enemies down
so the game proceed in that wayhowever the biggest treat you get was a frustrating mission where you need to shoot asteroids the came in like swam of bees with a stupid cannon that moves in a way to make sure that you miss a lot and get caned
if you die you will see your character die a dramatic death with his body thrown to the floor
cool eh
not after youve seen it for  million times in  consecutive hours
the problem is you dont have that much health and then the asteroids are very fast and the number is so huge that they just occupy every single polygon that the ps can process
so while you are busily shooting you will find yourself on a death roll already
adding to that is your stupid partner kept on asking you to give him more time and while you got distracted by his sweet voice it is the call of death  for the  millionth timeto be honest i was completely disappointed by ea at this point that i wish ea will tank itself into this same dead space that it created
the game was so promising and fun up to this point and they have to ruin it by putting in such a mission
whoever created this mission should be forced to do that for  years consecutively so that he will learn the lesson of never to do soso if you are up for a ridiculous challenge that will spoil your gaming experience get it out and try it
but make sure you have all your furniture soft padded or you will need to fork out more cash to replace your controller one after another
definitely a game for the rich and jobless  maybe paris hilton and her boyfriendsi wanted this to keep track of my weight and exercise for on the go but found it to hard to use for every day use
the ds is fine but has a smaller screen so i use my ds most of the time
the problem with that is this uses the gba game slot for the huge bulky pedometer in order to keep track of your walking routine
was a great thing for back then but was kind of hard to use because of the bulky pedometer its a big box with the gba cartridge slot attached to it which made it hard to clip on clothes for me without feeling itthis game is for kids
nothing good in the game for grown ups
just played it for  minutes and did not play it againi was upset over thisa you cannot plug this right into the wall you need to attach a cable to plug it inb i managed to find this cheaper by  at my local eb
which is usually not the case
i love amazon and was shocked to see thatit does its job but i just feel robbedits not a horrible case but i had a lot of problems with itfirst the pros howevergood protectioni liked the locking screen protector although even that has a flawcheapcons the worst offender for me were the rubber tread grips on the back they make it very uncomfortable to use i had to sand mine down one of the reviews said that the latches werent very secure well for me its just the opposite once i locked my psp in there it was very difficult to get back out again the l and r buttons are a bit harder to hit but not that bad the edging on my case is kind of sharp can hurt your hands when playing the lid doesnt come off so when your playing it just hangs off the top behind the device throws the balance way offoveralldespite its cheap price i cant recommend this case
i gave it two stars simply because it does provide good protection and i liked the built in screen protector despite it being so hard to openin short its convenient and cool but does not protect your pspmy psp spent the first few weeks of its life in one of these cases
it looks great can sort of play through if necessary and holds two spare games
its really great functionallyand then i dropped it
it fell a few feet from my hand onto asphalt
the case helpfully popped open and ejected the psp which bounced
it left marksyou get more protection from a cheap rubbery cover and screen protector and its easier to play throughalright listen
i got this and its bad
i hooked it up was online in minutes
went on brawl and guitar hero
all of a sudden dropped connection
wait a minute dropped connection on a wired connection
my labtop is wireless and i was connected just fine
do not buy this product
i only bought it because wired connection is faster but i may just stick with the official product instead
if you want a consistent connection try the official
you cant go wrong this is a bad productyes it works with the wii and is is a little better speed than i was getting on wifi but i have  meg connection and im only getting  megs throughput with this thing
it streams netflix ok but the wii videos on the shopping channels have to be set to low speed
my  xbox rocks with ethernet wired connection but my wii was just a little better after all the trouble of running cat  and buying this adaptor
speed checks over and over show a dismal  megs with  megs at my router
all my other devices are fast so i didnt lose much money on this but i wonder if the spendy wii adaptor will work better
i wanted speed and just got a slightly faster more reliable connection
i do have a lot of wifi in my neighborhod so i at least have a wired connection but nothing greatan extremely slow game that took me hours to make any headway
combat is automatic and restrictive in what actions i could perform based on a cooldown system that prevents players from doing anything beyond basic attacks more than once for certain amounts of real time
now this wouldnt be so bad if i was allowed by the game to have my thief class character attempt steal anything from monsters more than once every five minutes
the games presentation can be a mixed bag with slowdown and graphics that are plenty plain by todays standards with only the music standing tall as being noticeably goodi personally found this to be an overall dull game
i did not sit well with the fact that a plodding experience like this is something one pays for especially not how it is on a monthtomonth basis
id rather do something more immediately gratifying or worthwhile like playing an actually fun game
i sincerely hope final fantasy xiv this games onlineonly sequel lives up to its promise to deliver a faster more enjoyable experience and does better for itself and its community
we dont have all the time in the worldfor those of you who dont already play this game there is no reason to jump in now
it came in in  and although it was a decent game for the time there have been no improvements made to the game
two additional expansion packs have been released however
they add new armor and story for devoted players but these features will not initially be accessible to newbies
also this game has an incredibly high learning curve
you will feel very alienated when you first start and probably have a lot of trouble figuring out the convoluted world youre placed in
as for the actual game itself you required to invest a lot of time and effort for very little reward
the combat is good when you find a nice group of people but by the time everything comes together for a battle youve probably already spent  hours online
graphically the game really shows its age as well
the  version does not improve on the pc or even ps version of the game at alli really dont think this works very good at all
i bought this gun to go with a game my kids like to play on the wii
the gun works sometimes and then other times it just is off the mark so much
we used it twice and have since traded it in to gamestop
dont waste your moneyafter reading all of these glowing reviews and watching some on youtube i decided that this must be a fabulous piece of gaming equipment and ordered one but having been warned by one reviewerwhich is very vitalthat the length of time between pulling the trigger and the time it hits the button on the remote seems to be foreverthe same review went on to say that he had to jam a piece of plastic into the gun to make it so that the trigger while in resting position wasnt as far away since the folks at nyko couldnt figure out how to measure things properlyso in short my experience went as follows got the gun and put the remote in place
played around with it getting the feel and trying to see exactly how the trigger pulls the weight etc
instantly noticed that for my onlyslightlybiggerthantheaveragewomanssizedhands im a yr old guy for reference already felt uncomfortable around the somewhattoowide and blocky feeling handgrip
started playing house of the dead returnsthe intended purpose of actually getting a gun accessory besides the zapperand noticed immediately the delay with using a springloaded trigger to press a rather small b button on the front of the remoteit just plain takes too long with too much effort to squeezereleasesqueezerelease the trigger in order to pulloff rapid fire shots
when using the remote by itself i could squeezeoff  shots in the time it takes to do  with the perfect shotand modding the remote with the plastic dohickey
more complicated than it sounds
thatll be a personal mission for another dayi cant complain enough about this gun
maybe it does feel more like a real pistol but to me thats quite a sacrifice when trying to play a videogame with itits just not the same mechanicsfunctionality in my mind and in my trigger finger for that matteri found a thirdparty or really fifthparty pistolshaped gun accessory thats all over the internet for next to nothing on an auction site in my desperate search for a pistol accessory that actually works and that works beautifully
its much smaller overall and has a noticably shorter trigger response timethat is once i could figure out the exact angle to get the remote to fit but nothing is perfect after all rightupdaaaaaate there is now an official set of the cheap plastic knockoff being sold on amazon
and since a handful of the comments have asked exactly whut it was that i had been referring to i can now link to it here
hooraycta wigcs magnum gun combo for wiii ordered this item after having used the wii zapper and not exactly liking that you shoot with your less dominate hand using the zapper
that and having to use both hands is a bit of a turn offi figured the perfect shot would be more accurate and realistic
i have owned and still own nyko products and have never had any problems
until this item
which with such great reviews i can only hope i got a lemonpros and reasons i was excitedthe one handed conceptsolid buildeasy to follow instructions though they didnt workcompatiable with any game that uses the zapperhad no problem with trigger though no spring easy to fire at fast paceconsive used the zapper like ive said which takes mere seconds to put together and get started
but for some reason this gunwow what a pain
it took nearly  minutes when it looks like it just slides in because while i was trying to get the wiimote in the side slits that should allow the wiimote to slide in were no such help
it took sitting down really concentrating on it to put it in
its such a tight fit and when you finally get it down and go to click it into the plug thats located in the back of the gun slot it wont always go
i felt like i was going to either break the wiimote or the gunthe angle that you have to put the wiimote in seems too steep
getting the wiimote out was easier but i still felt like something was going to break
i could actually hear the plastic moving and cracking not to the point of breaking while trying to fit the wiimote in and outim sure there must be a technique for both getting it in and out but the easy to follow instructions did not help
plus i had to take the wiimote strap off because i couldnt snap it in with that either im assuming its a must do to use iti hope that its just a lemon not sure how but i can hope to ease my mind but as for the function of the gun and its use it was for the most part flawless
once forced into place it shot fine but it just wasnt what i was hopeing forthe plugs worked i like that you plug the nunchuck into the bottom but i think the design needs to be worked on
i could actually wipe away scrapings of the wiimote side where the gun had dug into iti gave it  stars because though it worked i dont want to use it for fear of breaking my wiimote
also for the fact that it scratches up the wiimote to the point of digging into iti wouldnt buy it againcool concept but the application just did not cut it for us
the sighting is off it does not zero when looking down the barrels sight
the trigger is just not friendly
went back to classic style controller with toggle and nunchuck
oh well we tried
at least it was not a big expenseafter first playing the demo for bourne conspiracy i was pleasantly surprised to find a fast paced and seemingly well made action title
while considering purchasing the game outright at  i decided to rent it first and im awfully glad that i didbourne conspiracy follows the plot of the bourne identity movie with a few extra missions and deviations from the script
fans of the movie will generally know what to expect when playing the gamemost video game players probably approach moviebased games with trepidation thanks to the industries spotty record with the genre
bourne conspiracy however is deceptively wrapped in an attractive package
the games graphics are a highlight of the title and the frantic pace of the action sequences will initially draw you into the titlehowever things quickly start to unravel after the first hour of game time
what is at first fresh quickly grows stale
the combat mechanics of the game rely on  buttons  a quick attack power attack and block
again while initially satisfying the melee combat quickly becomes repetitive
add the overabundance of quicktime events key moments where a certain button press or combination of button presses and the combat becomes boring very quickly
boss battles will largely rely on your performance with the block button and mashing the appropriate button during one of the countless quicktime events
combos are extremely limited due to the fact that only two buttons are available and most are limited to hit strings
generally combat goes like this mash attack buttons  block  qt event  bourne instinct more on this later rinse and repeatthe game also features one driving level that recreates the great chase scene in paris from the bourne identity movie
while not terrible the chase sequence is extremely linear and perhaps because of it the entire sequence feels drawn outthe shooting mechanics of the game are done quite well and anyone familiar with the mechanics used in games such as uncharted drakes fortune or gears of war will be familiar with the cover mechanic used herethe highlight of the game is the ability to use bourne instinct to immediately take down regular enemies with either hand to hand combat or weapons
the ability works in conjunction with an adrenaline meter that builds as you inflict damage on enemies
build enough adrenaline and youll be rewarded with the ability to see bourne unleash with his fists or weapons
the adrenaline meter builds up to three levels and that corresponds to the number of enemies you can kill simultaneously
the only drawback to this ability is that this too grows quite repetitive
there are a few deviations as bourne uses his environment and finds possible weapons in everything from shovels to desk chairs however all of the animations will look very familiar halfway into the gamethat brings up the last issue i had with the game its short
bourne conspiracy can literally be beaten in one sitting or about  hourshonestly by the conclusion of the game i was glad that it was short as i was finding the repetitiveness of the combat to be excruciating
all in all this game is a solid rental and even for die hard bourne fans i suggest renting before buyingthe graphics and explosions are terrible and the hand to hand is way too repetitive
the demo and game still have the same flaws the context sensitive button presses are terrible i want to control the action not press a timed button
the missions are stealth and running and very tiresome
overall a way too annoying game who ever did the combat moves ran out of ideasthis game was purchased for my fiance and he basically saidboring
it really wasnt as interactive as he thought and the graphics where poor
still likes the movies but the game stinksi gave it two stars because the item was shipped on time and arrived undamaged
be careful  though as these cheap imitation ones are not always read correctly by the wii or gamecube
it never saved my data and the one time it did it would not bring up my saved game because it said data is corrupt
hope this helpsthe game is so linear
it is always the same thing attack and capturedestroy or defend and capture buildings
the one thing that almost pissed me off was that no matter how many times i win or how little territories an enemy has they will attack and probably take your territory which you conquered a few minutes ago
more than that its like i win  time take their territory from you then they attack you twice or  times and can easily regain  of their territories back
that means you have to go back and defeat them again by doing all of the same things but then theyll take your other territory away for themselves
basically it encourages you to spend more hours in this game than you would
no thank you
i will uninstall it cause there are better games on my hard driveit started out to be fun but i should also mention that the camera feels like being imported straight from consoles
i also had some hard time learning how to do this and how to do that
it was especially hard since i start few games at once but usually it doesnt take me long to learn but not in this gameas for dlc the game is not worth it
 for a dlc to this game is too muchas a couple other reviewers said there is a long intro
so long of a set up that i didnt care anymore
i just wanted to start shooting something
then when i thought i was about to my character passes out from malaria and i still dont get to shoot someone
after watching the trailers i was excited it looked amazing
the developers talked about how immersive the game was it isnt that immersive
there are so many cut scenes its boring
the story line is pretty weak as well
this game is so totally boring compared to cod crysis or moha and any other fps out there
it mission based like gta but worse
you drive for  minutes to a town get a mission then drive another  minutes to get to the mission and finally fight for about  minutes
then if you want a weapon you have stop in the middle of the mission and find diamonds in the stupidest of places that waste even more time
what scares me the most is that the map is huge and the vehicles you drive tend to get soo shot up that end up going really slow or blowing up
so i already see that towards the end of the game there will be no vehicles left and you will probably not have a car to drive
minus the graphics the original far cry was so much better
if you want to see great graphics and want to drive around buy this
if you want to see great graphics and play an awesome fps go get crysisi purchased this item after deliberating whether or not to get this or left  dead
i wish i had purchased left  dead
the storyline is ok the graphics are ok the voice acting is terrible and the inventory of weapons is very limitedpros decent graphics does not require a top of the line pc to run at highest graphic settings decent storyline so far very open ended playcons graphics are not cutting edge crysis and warhead are both far superior does not support widescreen in a true format so had lots of problems getting it to run at a decent resolution on a widescreen lcd despite the packaging the game may not support dolby digital  despite many tries updating drivers etc
 does not work on my system weapons inventory is limited to  items one of each type
weapons are generic and not at all unique or interesting voice acting is super cheesy  the characters all speak very fast and monotone as if they were paid by the syllable or something
its embarrassingly badthis is a fine game to pick up for 
however i would not spend any more than thatheres my new review  this game is a hunk of junkheres my old reviewive only played it for a couple of hours but heres my review so farthe installation was a bit confusing a bit different than other installers ive seen but i got through it in about  minutes
it had to update the windows net framework and the c redistributable and since i had both on my machine im a software engineer for a living it got a little confused
not a big problem just had to say ok to errors then it ran finethe graphics   i was stunned
they are insanely realistic
i kept saying holy 
 out loud because the graphics are just so amazing
it is obviously optimized because it set all of my machine settings to the very highest
when you are given the ride in the jeep you see things like shadows from trees jumping across the drivers shirt and it just left me speechless from amazementthe sound  also quite incredible im running a bgears benspirer 
perhaps most noteable was hearing the breeze flow through the grass and the trees it sounds amazingly realistic much more so that crysis game play  well ill come back and fill this in but so far it was interesting
ive mostly just walked around and not doing objectives because i wanted to check out the graphics
but for example the screen is almost always free of any text or icons
its usually always only the environment around you
the first objective was to get a car
you have to walk up to this ugly yellow car open the hood fix it close the hood then get it the car
you may have to spend about  seconds adjusting it when it breaksagain the graphics are just incredible
after i fixed my first car i drove it over a bridge stopped halfway and got out of the car to look at the river below and its just absolutely breathtakinganyway more later
again dont worry about the netc install it does its just part of the operating system you need and may not havethe original farcry is still one of my favourite shooters of all time
farcry whilst having a  similar title is however something of a departure from the original farcry
the plot seems based on the book heart of darkness by joseph conrad whereby we see western characters bringing moral chaos into africa the games setting through gun running and other activites
you are sent in to this setting with the mission of killing the jackal  the chief gun runner and arms dealer causing this moral chaos
for those that have seen the idea portrayed in the film apocalypse now you will get the idea
this plot is revealed through finding tapes that reveal the jackals descent into moral darkness along the way in similar fashion to how the plot developed in bioshock
despite the same name as the original farcry is a whole different game perhaps closest in concept to stalker
farcry is a giant sandbox whereby you get to do whatever it is that you please and tackle the game in any manner that you want very similar in concept to how stalker functioned
stalker was a fantastic game and should be played by anyone interested in shooters and first person style rpgs
farcry however fails to implement the elements needed in quite the same fashion as stalker and the game quickly becomes boring and repetitive
there are almost no rpg elements that stalker has and so the tasks that farcry asks you to accomplish become pointless and unimaginative
the world that is created is missing a few things like civilians and people living their lives refugees and hence offers you no reason to feel at home in the enviroment build a house or setup a base such as you might do in oblivion and like
the world is populated by people that simply want to kill you they will attack even if they have no chance of success and so in the course of the game your moral compass will shift from seeing if the person is a friendly to murdering people in their cars with flame throwers so they wont irritate you by running you off the road
in this sense the game actually succeeds in advancing the plot so you find the heart of darkness but not because of the storytelling but because everything in the game is so annoying that you just want it to die
as much as i wanted to like this game i found myself playing it to completion for the sake of liberating my hard drive space for something better  never a good sign
how come nobody can do a remake of the original farcry but update the graphics and add a bunch of new levels or something
how good would that be
i am starting to think that the original was a fluke
the games magazines give this an impressive rating meanwhile the gaming community has panned it  why do we still buy those magazinesstability stable for the most part other than the xfi problem
if you have an xfi and an nforce chipset then many have experiences snaps and crackling with the sound
i had this problem and could not resolve it
so if your system is suspect to this as mine is then farcry is the worst affected that i have found
other than sound i did not experience any crashes whilst playing in hrs of gameplaygraphics inevitably this is going to be measured up against crysis
is farcry as impressive as crysis in the graphics department  nope but i would argue that it is good enough nonetheless
it is similar is quality to halflife  but perhaps closest in look and feel to soldier of fortune payback  for those who played that game
farcry is slightly drabber that the brighter and more sprightly look is sof payback but the feel is the same
i enjoyed the environment for the most part even if it got repetitive after awhile
overall the feel and look of the environment is well done though doesnt vary much like farcry the original did
the irony is that sof payback might be the better gamesound apart from the xfi problem i mentioned the sound track fits quite well to the environment and doesnt ever feel annoying or out of place
however the sound affects are only better than average though the atmospheric sounds do their job
there is also a sound positioning problem for those running  setups however the patch designed to fix this didnt work so well for megameplay this is the problem area
whereas stalker managed to mix the sandbox idea with an rpg system with sound and npcs really well as well as immersing you in a believeable environment farcry is really a let down in this department
the weapons never really improve you cannot upgrade your car you never develop any real friends in the game and the gameplay is a snoozefest
my wife was watching over my shoulder one night as i was playing and she said isnt this boring
couldnt have said it better myself
farcry worked because it kept the open ended part of the game only big enough to allow variety in how to get to an objective
stalker worked because it allowed rpg elements that affected what you could do in the game and gave incentive for going out and exploring and becoming enveloped in the story
farcry does neither of these things it just gives a massive gameworld with nothing interesting to do it
no villages to save no homes to make no affecting the game in any real way just tedious driving and console like diamond hunts
doing console tasks on a pc is a drag as is farcry
the game might have worked better if you went down a long river and got to upgrade your barge without having to go anywhere twice apocalyse now anyone
too late to speculate nowlength took me about  hours including wasting my time finding all of the diamonds  a  pointless task since you get more than enough money
this is a good standard by todays games howeever one has to question whether is is  quality hours
i argue for the negative farcry has its moments but these only amount to about  hours worthreplayability i didnt bother with multiplayer as i have no friends who own the game and  perhaps they are wise as they wish not too
if you find clipping your toenails to be exhilirating then this could be the game for youverdict 
in the end a mediocre effort an impressive presentation but lacked fun
a far  cry from the original pun intendedmy current fps ranking of alltime favourite shooters that i have played farcry the original and expansion packs and in particular the gearbox one crysis including expansion packs stalker halflife the original rainbow six vegas  fear quake  halflife  bioshock call of duty x farcry rests somewhere down here along with sof paybacki wrote this a bit later than most other reviewers here because i just got around to playing it
i got this from amazon for 
well it was not much of a bargain
not a bad game but the repetition of the missions the long trips between missions and the continuous respawning of the checkpoint enemies really wears thin after several hours of play
game play is pretty much the same mission after mission
accept mission find mission on map drive to mission truck gets shot up racing through checkpoint truck steams stop use truck mounted gun to take out the goons in the inevitable checkpoint pursuit truck fix truck continue to next checkpoint
a few gliders here and there remind you of how much fun the original far cry was
no complaints about the graphics because they are decent but the soundtrack gets repetitive after a while and i ended up shutting it off
actually started the game twice
first time something happened a third of the way in to the game and it would not start
had to reinstall and start over
fun
ive read a lot of complaining about drm and the limited installs you can do with this game but not to worry
i doubt very much anyone will be playing this game more than once
this could have been a very good game
what a shamei can only support what has been said more eloquently by others
in a word maladorouos
the game came free with a video card so i wont complain about the cost even though one should be paid to play it
i have not played it online this is for the single player versionalthough the graphic presentaton is very very good there is no variety and it becomes boring
except in the no shooting zones everyone tries to kill you for no reason
every mission is a bloodbath
the missions are basically the same thing go kill this guy
the same enemies pop up again and again even  seconds after wiping out a strong point
if you travel   yards they are back
there does not seem to be much of a story either
after a while the tedium wears you down and you stop playing
there is no relatlionship between this game and the original far cry
ubisoft just screwed it up
play either stalker game insteadpros very good graphic presentationinstallation was easycons the graphic presentation gets boring
there is so little ofinterest or surprisethe missions are repetativeeveryone is hostilethe local wildlife is always running in front of your vehicle to bekilled
what is this forsecure romdont think i can finish itplease dont spend much money on itfirst the goodgood graphicssniping is fun
you can wound an enemy in order to draw out their friends while he writhes on the ground in painyour ingame buddies actually kill enemies
a few times i showed up to rescue a buddy and all the bad guys were dead alreadyyou get to drive different types of cars and boatsnow the uglythere are basically three different types of missions in this game  assassinate somebody
blow up something
get an item which is likely located in the middle of an enemy basedo any of the above missions many times
it gets old fast
plus you have to run all over the map to get to each mission which means that you can either wipe out multiple guard posts or try to sneak by them
too bad enemies can spot you in the dead of night in the wild jungle from  feet away about  of the time
i eventually just started driving at full speed through most guard checkpoints
then i would stop my car which almost always was badly damaged by enemy gun fire kill anybody following me and then take their cara mac kills faster than a pkm
who decided on the weapon damage in this gameweapons degrade quickly which pretty much forces you to buy the reliability upgrade for each weapon you usesilenced weapons are pretty useless since the enemy homes in on you instantlythe plot involves two factions fighting for power in some nameless african nation
honestly i really dont know what really happened because the paperthin plot was just an excuse to kill people blow things up or retrieve items
id say that tetris has a more involving story
it feels like a lot of work went into this game only for it to be rushed out the door  months before it was completedi have a twospeaker audio setup
although music and weapons fire came through loud and clear i had trouble hearing voices
a web search revealed that this game uses  surround sound and voices come through the middle speakerwhich i dont have
there is no way to change the ingame settings
thankfully subtitles appear so you dont have to hear the voices but this is just part of why it feels like this game was rushed out the door before being finishedi cannot recommend this gamefarcry  where to begin
first the graphics and overall visuals are exceptional
there are limits to the amount of damage you can do to the environment
only certain things burn or break off and it is really cheesy by the time you get the hang of it
you cant just set fire to the entire forest because even dry bushes burn out by themselves
pyromaniacs will be disappointedthe gameplay and weapons physics are the worst parts of the game
weapons seem to rust and jam very frequently and it takes the reliability upgrade to make the weapon last longer than  missions
there is no lean or prone command for your character which reduces the tactical nature of the gamethe worst aspect is the brainnumbing traversal system
going from point a to point b is awful
if you drive a car you run into a technical within a few minutes
the checkpoints are always hostile
this game offers no satisfaction in maintaining a reputation level since there arent any true allies
you might as well walk from point to point which takes even longer
you cannot get rid of enemies at checkpoints on a permanent basis
they always respawnthe jackal character pisses me off
his voice acting is horrible and he makes you do the stupidest things to progress in the game
the missions are linear and idiotic in nature blow this pipeline take out this convoy etc the ending has to be one of the worst game endings in history since it offers a really dumb choice for the character
the malaria system makes the gameplay boring not excitingthe weapon selection isnt terribly exciting
the primary weapons range from submachineguns like the mpsd to rifles a modified m ak to sniper rifles barrett m dragunov svd and even a semiautomatic milkor mgl mm grenade launcher made in south africa
secondary weapons are mainly pistols desert eagle  walther colt  but also include the m grenade launcher flare gun and ieds
you always get a machete but a special weapon choice is also available
here you can choose from a pkm machinegun the m saw rpg or a carl gustaf m antitank weapon think bazooka that you can guide like a tow missile from battlefield overall the visuals are only soso
they might appeal to gamers that think crysis was amazing but it still isnt very realistic
after playing farcry  i think i will skip out on playing crysis and crysis warhead because both of these games seem to focus on style over substance
it would take one heck of a plot and unique gameplay to convince me to fork over money for crysis maximum editionbottom line farcry  has a subpar storyline poor voice acting horrible gameplay and i wanted to just get done with the game asap
it is that bad
the game also crashes intermittently about every hour of gameplay
i know several other people that tried farcry  and they all said it was a frustrating experience
the game just plain sucks because i did not feel any type of connection to the characters or the plot
i didnt care what happened after  of the game because it was just a lackluster overall experienceto improve the game they need to revamp the checkpoint system and enemy ai
they should also import the tactical system and weapon handling system from rainbow six vegaspros decent visuals some nice explosions and brushfirescons no substance
horrible gameplay characters storyline etci give it  out of  starsthat was the reaction of my pc to this game
i bought it for cheap hoping that it was going to be at least as good as the first far cry
boy was i wrongthe game first connected to internet to selfapply updates
uhoh i thought this usually means trouble
then the game started  blocky blotchy rendering so bad that i could not navigate through the gameeverything is brown why
the buldings the grass the cars the weapons everthing
my machine should not throw up when it tries to play this game what a messat first i thought it was my video card i spent  on a new card and guess what
the graphics are still terrible
washed outvague looking and bad like something from the mids
looks like the jungle was developed from salvadore dalis own nightmare
weapons sound like airsoft versions of the same
not realistic at all
ubisoft should have stuck with the cartoon type of display of far cry
video is terrible
i am playing on a high end dell q with gb memory and a ddr graphics card gt
i am totally disappointed
at least with the new graphics card fc looks even more amazing
this game is awful
save your moneyfar cry  is ok its nothing to write home about thoughmy issues with the game
 guns  who did the firearm research on this game
some guns like the ak are completely mirror image
some like the hk g are just wrong
charging handle and ejection port both on the left side
not in this reality
 damage  shooting someone in the chest with  rounds from the pkm to kill them
zzzzz
 no prone
come on is this the s
 enemies can see me in the dead of night and know where i am even when i am in the bushes and using a silencer
hmmm
 repetative missions  wow lets do the same missions over and over and over and over and over
 respawning badguys
just cleared that guard post
funny that all the guards are back  minutes later
 most realistic fire ever
 with fire graphics that look completely unrealisticgive this property back to crytech
ubisoft did a halfbaked job at bestedit also the drm this game installs broke the burn feature of windows media player on my pc
buyer bewareedit  securom has a program on their website that will allow you to remove their drm from your machine
however it will be reinstalled  without warning or notification  the very next time you play a game with securom drm
if  like me  you have issues with burning cds after installing one of these game you pretty much have to uninstall the drm anytime you want to burn
convenient huhyou could say that they upgraded the graphics from the original far cry but they seriously downgraded the fun and immersion level
actually i am not reminded of the original game in any way when i play thisi agree with most of the negative reviews here
its not a complete loss but when you try to trade on the name of a timeless classic of the genre youd better at least create something that is not a downgrade
pc gamer magazine gave this an unbelievable  rating but they did say that after you play about  hours some of the cleverness of the game design starts to emergeim not interested enough to play that much of thisback in  the original far cry came out of nowhere
it burst onto the first person shooter scene that had been dominated by id quake doom etc and valve halflife series and gave everyone an innovative fps with amazing graphics huge almost sandbox levels good ai and an original locale
the stage was set for a sequel which everyone eagerly anticipated
the original far cry team released crysis in  and ubisoft the publisher released far cry  in   this sequel as many reviewers have pointed out is rather disappointingpros a unique environment africa that hasnt been done to death
a tons of unlockable guns and a good assortment of fun weapons like flamethrowers grenade launchers and mortars
decent though overrated ai
saveanywhere is nice as are your buddies which help you outcons an essentially soulless environment tedious and repetitive gameplay
its amazing how devoid of any personality the world is
its a largely repetitive empty world which you will be tediously crisscrossing ad nauseam in order to get to your next missionthe missions are almost always assassination missions drive to point x kill y or fedex missions drive to point x deliver y
the problem is that the environment is not really openended
high mountains mean that the only way to get around for most of the game is by car and this means that you have to drive by the same stupid guard posts every time
unlike far cry or oblivion you are pretty much stuck on the roads that the developers want you to use
the graphics are nice but nothing compared to crysis or even oblivion
i run the game on ultrahigh with directx  and am not overwhelmedthe ai is also not nearly as amazing as advertised
the bad guys take a seemingly endless amount of shots to die which really cuts into the realism
they can spot you at night in the brush from  yards away and are amazing drivers and shootersoh and the biggest strike of all against it this game ships with securom drm antipiracy software which insidiously installs itself like spyware and limits the number of times you can install the gamethe original farcry was one of my alltime favorite games and which i played through several times
this shares the name only and should have been titled grand theft auto africa
the dunia engine gives great results as my gt would scarcely slowdown while running across miles of jungle landscape
the graphics were phenomenal the only thing that disappointed me is the appearance of the characterslike the grand theft auto series its a go anywheredo what you want game
the trouble with these games are the activities are largely filler except for the missions to advance each levelyoure a mercenary playing off competing factions but in this world everyone is a mercenary they all look alike and except for twothree sequences the only person they want to kill is youthe gameplay is maddeningly repetitive every time you do a mission for an arms dealer its the exact same mission every mission for the resistance its the same house and same people in different locations every time the bad guys come at you in a vehicle they always floor it until theyre on top of you then stop it and step out
blam blam that was funthe guns wear out by becoming inaccurate then unreliable and finally coming apart
however this happens so fast its no wonder theres a huge demand for arms
the flamethrower is fun the first time or two but sooner or later the game boils down to driving endlessly to get to the next objective
are we there yetonly very late in the game does the story start to develop and it blows it completely on the ending
you have two choices and both are stupidyou can take your pick as to which is more disappointing a game that is frustrating and boring or a frustrating and boring game that could have been great with a good story and actionthere is really no point whining about the drm
sure having the cd in the drive to play is a bit annoying but not a big dealyou guys should get over it
rating a game poorly only because the drm issue covers the real problemsthe game itself is the problem
i only play multiplayer i dont even touch the single player the way you join a a server is so complicated i could not understand the logic behind it for the longest time usually you can only choose from about  servers
in cod there is always more than  the motion blur is too obvious whats up with the sounds
the gun shots reminds sounds from old atari times
these are the most horrible sounds i heard in last  years when a grenade explodes near you the whole screen shakes so violently i want to throw up my lunch the running animation is just very bad
it also makes you vomit
 i dont know whot it is but i have no hud on my screen
it just wont show up the game crashes in the weirdest ways possible
quite often toonot recommended not before it is fixed but i dont believe this will ever happenedit after giving the single player mode another chanceif you have nerves to go thru the tutorial the single player becomes interesting
the driving is not as bad as some people saythis game has a special spot in the shoebox of shamefully boring games
this game was so much fun for the first  hours
then we are put through the most repetitive gameplay i have ever been through
literal the same missions are giving to you over and over again
it takes forever to get from one stop to another but only  minute to complete the missions
 percent of your time is spent driving fighting enemy patrol cars fighting enemy outpostthe enemies re spawn the minute you leave the location
the machete is useless there is no character development the story is weak at best there are very few weaponson a bright side we get amazing graphics for its time the ability to burn down fields of grass as a means of distraction realistic gun and jamming sequences and other small aspects that in no way shape or form make up for the negative aspectsi had high hopes during the first hour of two but this is one game i will never play againyet boring in its gameplay and with luke warm reviews this game still looks amazing
nearly as good as crysiswith the same makers and engine what it lacks is substantial gameplay
never the less on the outside its beautiful
graphical orderpcpsequalafter so many good reviews a game must be goodright
wrongi played this game for about  hours and i could bearly do that i had to quit the game was so boringthere was a few things to do to complete the game and that was it
the creator of this game must have been bought offi dont have alot to say about the game except beware of buying it
if you have to play it rent it firstgood game and good luckmy sister purchased this and so i played it over at her place
there are a lot of good racing stages and that is what most people buy this game for
ive always preferred the battle mode though
so while the racing stages are incredible and a few new items and challenges have been added the battle mode has become more of a battle against the pc than other players
in previous games it was just you and anyone else you could get to play
now you dont have that option which takes away the fun because theres no real competition since the ai is not very bright but always gets in the way and there are usually large obstacles in the battle levels that can take you out
so rather than battle mode id call this survival against the ai modei bought this game to try it out july th since then ive played about  hours
i wanted a game that was easy to jump into
boy was it a mistake getting this gamethe game punishes you for being good
st place
not for longeveryone from thth place gets stars red shells green shells blue shells which hit exclusively those in st place lightening  pow which hit all but he or she whom uses it and speed boost
once hit by a blueshell youll then get bombarded by green shells and red shells and run off the track by other players
once hit by lightening or pow you lose all your itmes
periodbut do not fret st placer you will get so many bananas that you actually go bananas
thats not all you may get an upside down cube or gasp green shell that you can blindly throw backwardsbut if you suck at this game boy are you gonna love it
you get stars to knock everyone out of the way or even a bullet which is basically an automatic first place
screw up again and again
no worry more stars and bulletsi dont mind chance i love chance such as poker
but imagine texas hold em if the losing person automatically got pocket aces every hand while the chip leader got   offsuit
not so interested in betting anymore ehit wouldnt be so bad if you got to save an item after getting hit eg you get a mushroom while in th place and get hit by lightening but you dont drop the mushroom
or if for the love of insert preferred deity the first place person could get some kinda shield every once in awhilenintendos pretty damned arrogant thinking i want to play luigis circuit  times in order to unlock baby daisyonline mode
im getting better
but as with most any online game noobs are gonna get frustrated by those who have played dozens of hours and can get through the courses with their eyes closedthe game feels close to impossible using the motion sensors
while the motion controls are good the level of drifting accuracy needed to compensate for the cheap pos computer can only be done with a remotethis would be a fun party game with friends but if you get this and expect to jump right in and kick some mario butt please reconsider
there will be words coming out of your mouth in tounges you never knew
you will be bombarded by shells both online and off
you will lose your mind body soul
you will well you get the ideanintendo please let the items be random in future games
with sugar on top
pleaseas many reviewers have already stated this is a fun game for the first few weeks then the fun quickly wears off for everyone
to unlock the last few characters dry bowser  rosalina in the  cc and mirror cups is next to impossible without pure luck
it has nothing to do with skill
my son  and i have spent countless hours winning the first  races in a given cup within the  cc only to be mercilessly punished in the final races sometimes just before the finishmy son and i have finally given up in digust and were looking for other racing games instead
whoever designed this within nintendo had to be one mean sob to set it up this way
truly not a fun game for the last few unlockablesmy biggest gripe with nintendo is regarding the unlockables themselves
im fine if you want to make us earn the unlockables but did you have to make it so frustrating mean and nearly impossible to do so
the races are pure luck as you can be in first place and within seconds the computer ai throws weapons at you that land you in last place coming into the finish
not only is this unfair its down right rotteneither give the characters away as part of the  i shelled out for your game nintendo or make the unlockables something that your average gamer can attain without spending s of maddening hours repeating the same races over and over again because the computer cheated them at the most vulnerable point in the race the finishbmlsthe overall racing part of the game is enjoyable but one of my favorite aspects of the game has always been battle mode
they completely ruined this by removing the free for all option and forcing team playthis coupled with the fact that the battle arenas are too large for  people to play and most of the time is spent simply trying to locate each other
battle mode should have been given the option for a free for all and some smaller maps for  players
i hope they correct this in future releasesi have owned every mario kart game and consider myself to be a bit of an addict spending embarrassing amounts of time practicing things such as power sliding on straight aways and downing suckaz with simple items such as banana peels
so needless to say i was very excited for a mario kart game that would allow me to showcase my skills online and relive memories with old multiplayer comrades who have since moved to other parts of the countryimagine my surprise when i put the disc in and discovered that there was no multiplayer grand prix mode
working in tandem to unlock new classes tracks carts and racers had always been one of my favorite parts of mario kart and it was something that double dash did to perfection allowing up to four people to get in on the challengei had invited the friend whom i played through all of the double dash grand prixs with over to do it again on the wii so after we found this out it sort of killed the buzz but whatever we had always spent a lot more time on battles than grand prixs anywaywe found surprise again when we couldnt do a free for all battle
after messing around with some vs races on motorcycles we decided to ditch this game and spent the night on the snes and playing bobomb blast on double dashthe bulk of my issues with this game can be condensed to three itemslack of optionslack of skilllack of creativitydouble dash was filled with options you could combine characters in various ways to get certain unique items or racer attributes
you could choose the number of laps in vs races and take your choice of three unique battle styles
in mario kart wii the lack of options is mind numbing quite honestly
it makes the game feel as though it was rushed to production
why cant i choose how many computer characters participate in a battle or vs race
why isnt multiplayer gp available
why are there only two battle modes one of which is hell of lame
perhaps most annoying of all why cant i choose to turn the stupid racer name tags that submerge half the screen off when i play online
the lack of skill required in this game was evident from my first gp race
every other mario kart game did a good job of making item boxes scarce and the occurence of items such as blue shells and lightning very infrequent although there was an option in double dash to change this
there are several tracks on the wii version that are nearly unplayable because of the volume of items
with  players and the stupid items like the thwomp and lightning cloud that dont really help anyone it just isnt racing anymore when there is absolutely no value to your place in the first  of the race
coming back with items is one of the great joys of mario kart i understand that i still have fond memories of hitting the super ramp on mario circuit  with a mushroom to cut a corner and jump up two places to secure first over ten years ago but there is something else going on entirely in tracks like the luigi circuit on the wii which might be one of the worst mario kart tracks ever where every racer gets ripped to shreds on every lap because of the overwhelming volume of itemsthis gripe could easily branch into things like how the power slide boost for the first time ever is not controlled by the player and im not talking about the manual vs auto drift but simply by the length of time you hold the slide and how they reverted to the hold and wait technique of blocking items that existed in mario kart  as opposed to timing a reverse release to block such as in double dash and how the get a boost when you are right behind someone for awhile time has been cut down to almost nothing but i think i have said enough on thisthe tracks and items in general though where is the creativity
im not expecting the wildly refreshing array of tracks we were greeted with in mario kart for the gba or the slew of new items that required poise and tact to make decent use of that showed up in double dash but there is nothing new on the wii version
let me rephrase that there are a couple of new things but they are quickly beaten to death via recycling soooooooooooo many figure s or in cases such as the mega mushroom little more than repeats of other items in this case the star
the half pipe thing is new but i dont really see the purpose when it is faster to not go up the ramp
and the motorcycles who caresif the drift controls were the same as in double dash no one would choose them for the cheap wheelie boostthen there are the lazy rehashes of the classic tracks
changing the placement of item boxes and other key features of the tracks such as making the walls solid in the ghost valley track and removing the rock throwing natives on the n dk track i just dont see the point
i mean i know that most people probably dont have every nintendo console sans virtual boy within  feet of eachother in their entertainment room so playing ghost valley  on snes isnt really an option but seriously
some of these rehashed classic tracks arent even worth playing in the form they are presented herethere are a few nice features
toads factory grumble volcano and koopa cape are amazing tracks
there are a lot of karts to choose from although the differences as i can tell so far seem to be negligible unlike the kart selection in double dash where the differences were quite obvious
and its not like the game is unplayable quite the contrary it can even be enjoyable for short periods of time
as part of the mario kart franchise though i just expect morei honestly dont know why though as every big franchise title aside from mario galaxy and twilight princess has been like this
no options dumbed down game play terrible online game options and matching features basically just leaving a ton of potential on the table and all of my expectations largely unfulfilledthis is easily the worst mario kart game and definitely the last wii game i preorderoh and the wii wheel dont buy extras of these
they arent worth the hassle
after struggling with getting my kart to power slide correctly through two grand prixs i dug out the cube controllers ps  why is there no option to configure buttons how i want
or better question why does the gcn controller layout not match that of gcn mario kart when the only new feature is wheelies which could easily be added onto the unused cstick or dpad or even better onto the l trigger that items are incorrectly assigned toi wanted to like this game so bad but it failed
it starts out promising but soon you get sick of doing the same thing over and over again
i liked the whole rock and roll idea and summoning your car by playing a little guitar solo but the combat system and story killed this game for me
do yourself a favor and get a real hack and slash game go out and buy darksidersthe only two reasons why this game got more than one star is because i actually like jack black and the soundtrack is freaking awesome
the game play though lacks so much to be desired
the story doesnt flow very smoothly at all and the play control isnt very precise
about  of the game seems to be boss battles where you really cant tell whether or not you are even hurting the boss or how much damage the boss actually has
the rest is just some hack and slash nonsense interrupted by some cool dialogue and musicif this was a movie i would probably rate it much higher
but its not
its a game and the game part of it isnt very goodif this had been an xbox live arcade game that had cost  i think itd be great but as a full retail game i really thought it was lacking
it was just super repetitive after the first hour  no matter how hard i tried to get into it i just couldnti was expecting so much better
the gameplay is terrible story is weak and its not that funny
the voice acting is decent
from what i read i was expecting something new and fresh instead i got a bad gamesince max payne thirdperson shooters are often injected with a cinematic sense of style
wet however is intent on taking the connection between film and game to a new level
the game blatantly rips its influences from s grindhouse films and the visual flair of movie directors like quentin tarantino and robert rodriguezthe prostons of violent actionexcellent production values and use of the grindhouse themeacrobatic gunplay can be funthe conslackluster graphicsnonstandard levels are mediocrephysics and gameplay in need of refinementnothing new or better than what weve seen beforethis game was a massive disappointment
its glitchy as hell and the controls are so bad it makes the platforming parts of the game just an annoyance rather than fun
the upgrade system blows
there is no chapter restart so if you screw up you cant just restart the chapter
instead you are screwed loading to the same point in the game every time
you would have to restart the entire game to go back to the beginning of a chapter
you cant replay cut scenes so dont press start or leave the room
also there are moments that make no logical sense
like why is a gatling gun offered across an arena in assistance to killing a gatling gun boss when it cant actually kill him the devs clearly didnt learn from gears of war
instead hell limp for about  seconds and you have to somehow manage to get across the arena to activate the quicktime event that will finally kill him because if you dont hell recover and shot the hell out of you
prior to this arena battle the gatling gun bosses were all able to be killed without activating a quicktime event and sadly this part didnt happen till chapter  the final level
and to be honesty the game was actually decent up until chapter  in chapter  the difficulty suddenly shots through the roof because somehow the bad guys are more resistant to bullets including headshots
also the platforming increases
now the platforming was always a pain but it wasnt as frequent so the game loses a lot of what was fun when this happens
this game had a ton of potential
the grindhouse style in presentation is awesome
the graphics are really bad for a current generation title but could actually be overlooked if the gameplay was better
going from run and gun to sword slashing melee is a great idea just not well executed
bottom line glitches and gameplay kill this game which is sad because the story is really fun
if you like this game good
but as for me this was terrible and in the end it was just too frustrating to enjoywet is an enjoyable third person shooter that gets all of its premises correct but fails in other major areas
ill start with the things this game gets correct
rubi is cool quickwitted agile talented and extremely agitated
this frustration leads to ruthlesssness ie
everybody dies
theres one mode when rubi gets upset and is by far the most fun to be had in the game
the screen goes red black and white and the enraged rubi can make quick work of her foes
theres also a few fun sequences such as jumping car to car in traffic like the matrix and falling out of a plane and those are very well executed
she moves fairly fluently and the slow motion shooting aspect is both fun and highly functional
simply put its fun to play as rubiin spurtsthis game is only good in spurts mostly because the story is flat out terrible
the story is so convoluted confusing and incoherent that it doesnt drive the story forward
the only motivation to move forward is to finish the game
the villains are forgettable the side characters are more annoying than interesting and no character is developednot even rubi
theres no back story on her as shes pretty much an assassin that lives in the desert
her personality nor motivation changes at all throughout the course of the game
we are thrust right into a shooting arena and the game goes along in that manner for the entire duration
rubi doesnt have to learn any of the skills that carry throughout the game
so pretty much from the jumpyoure a bad a and only you can stop yourself
rubi malone seems like a character that can be developed a lot better than presente and some more formidable opponents should have been created
i mean reallya guy with a gatling is your biggest competition
the graphics are below standard
im reading that that is the overall style of this type of art style but still the graphics leave much to be desired
the fire and water look absolutely terrible especially after playing games like assassins creed uncharted enslaved heavenly sword etc
the buildings are murky and difficult to look at and distinguish from one another the characters are blockyand overall the game just looks bad
even the cutscenes look bad
it looks like a ps gamethe level design is also very weak and the platforming is horrible and probably should have been left out
the camera fails to swing around so often times you are just jumping on a prayer
simply put it isnt fun climbing along walls jumping from pillar to pillar etc like it is in other games
its more like when is this going to be over so i can shoot some people type of experience
the arena sequences are fun but sometimes no a lot of times its tough to determine how to get to some of the bonuses and swings
its also tough to determine where and how many doors there are to close to complete
that part was hit or misssome arenas were a blast while others were just a chore
and some of the enemies could take  minutes of gatling gun to the chest and not diei felt that was strangebut nothing too deterringoverall the game is fun but is only worth one playthrough in my opinion
id give the game a i wanted to like this game and im usually not swayed by any bad reviews
i like to try it for myself but i didnt enjoy the gameplay
i found the slow motion moves annoying and you die quite easily after being unsure where to go next and not really able to shoot people right in front of you
you can only do the slow motion moves unless youre using the sword
camera angles switch on you which makes aiming difficult
then you have run around in circle like a monkey just to get another flying or sliding shot in
overall i was just disappointed i might give it another try but it is likely going to be sold offlike everyone else i really looked forward to playing this game as i played the game i became disappointed and very frustrated like the majority who have played wet
my problems were spending so much time negotiating certain areas of this game repeatedly so i could move on and complete the chapter
glitches and hangups presented itself in every chapter and at times and i was swearing more than rubi
aiming was off a bit and it would take a full clip on all weapons just to take down the security guards as with the sword and i had all the weapon upgrades
my wireless contoller response to my flatscreens screens video games commands were slow and were the main cause to this video games main problems and the unnecessary deaths rubi experienced repeatly in this game
this could and would have been an enjoyable and great game if it didnt have the problems this gamer always encountered sorry rubi i just couldnt complete your missioni was so excited for this game and now i feel let down
this game literally had me wanting to throw my controller through my tv half the time
wet is the story of a problem fixer named ruby voiced nicely by eliza dushku
she takes jobs to eliminate targets and get caught in a war between two drug lords
the characters and art styles of the game were interesting this game reminded me of max payne
the problem is max payne was better and it came out what  years ago
the aiming for this shooter is a bit dated what saves it is that when you jump slide or shoot time is slowed down and ruby always lock on one target with her duel weapons allowing you to mow down enemies
in fact if you arent jumping or sliding or something youll be dead soon
this works fine in combat and its fun
however the numerous bugs and glitches wear your patience thin by the rd level and things keep sliding down from there
i died a ton of times trying to jump from ledges due to poor camera and touchy controls
there were numerous sequences that really pissed me off
first there was this spot where you fell from a plane that must have took me about an hour and half to master
then there was an area were you had to slide under a door and shoot  locks on each side to progress the auto aim is random and i found this task to be harder than it should have
the game is very fast paced and has a nice style its too bad they were so sloppy with its design
my advice is to pass or rent it
dont buy it though its short and frustrating as hellthis game looks terrible
i bought it for a cheap price and couldnt be bothered to open the game
i sold it for a profit and laughed all the way to the banki am pretty confident that i have played if not as much more games than any reviewer on here and i can surely say this game is garbage
if you play sega games modern sega games you will realize they get a kick out of punishing the gamer more than rewarding them
this takes the cake
brutally terrible checkpoint system horrible combat system and no its not a hackandslash but still after about stage  on normal diffculty the odds become incredibly stacked against you
its just plain not fun
the concept is cool and when you first start you can see how this could be a great game but overal its about the fun and experience and not a concept that keeps you playing
it lacks everything
the leveling up is a joke and no matter how good you do you will always get a cgrade for your performance
diffculty level on normal would be hard or expert in most other games but yet again it is sega where you must be punished for purchasing their games not all but most
you are better off taking  dollars and buying a pack of smokes because even if you dont smoke this game will make youi was one of those kids who used to bring three rolls of quarters with him to the arcade
golden axe was a favorite of mine
although back in the day i used to play the little guy who wielded a giant axe the girl was great for her powerful magic that she would unleash on the bad guys
when i got the sega genesis version i was hooked
it was just like the original
also golden axe  was a favorite of mine as well
when i heard golden axe was coming to xbox i couldnt hardly wait for it
i bought it
it is sheer disappointment
you can walk through some debris ugh
where was the production team
the beasts are clunky to control fighting skills are very limited magic was nothing to look at either although the scenery was good as well as the graphics
i would have liked a free roam type of game with this please reissue the originals to an xbox platformfirst let me start by saying that i played through the first condemned game back when xbox  first launched and i did like that game
i played condemned  many years later and i think i assumed that it would have improved on the first game making my expectations too high
i suppose playing a game for the first time in  that was released in  would explain why it feels so outdated
one of the problems with the first game was that the combat was a little sloppy
everything was melee guns
what guns
i got bored beating crazies with a gas pipe or a plank of wood
so condemned  improved on this right
not really
there are now combos that you can use but thats about it
youre still stuck swinging a pipe at weirdos
your movement is slow there are no real scares the story is lameits just not a great game
maybe it was in  but after playing so many quality games over the past  years condemned  just doesnt stack up
if you played the first condemned and really loved it then you may find some enjoyment in c
its not the worst game ive ever played but i will say that i played about  hours of this game and was so bored with it i had to turn it offat its best the game is a fun shallow experience at its worse it is an incredibly annoying experience
i gave up on this game after i kept dying during the sky diving minigame the mechanics didnt work and the game wasnt worth grinding over
basically every move you learn in the tutorial will be your entire game experience there is absolutely no depth in the gameplay
while its fun at first it quickly becomes dull and repetitive
every time youre fighting someone you have to either jump or slide to start the bullettime and each jumpslide is exactly the same
i wish there were some sort of modifiers to add different movements to break up the monotony
related to this if you try to shoot when you arent jumping or sliding the gun firerate is about a  of the speed making it uselessso dont buy this game if you want to experience it just download the demoback in the day you could go to a drive in and watch really bad action movies like bare knuckles or murder high
although the movies lacked production values morals and common sense they were entertaining and fun
wet captures that experience quite nicelyconcept a beautiful girl in leather pants guns down  henchmen with a gatling gun while s rock n roll plays in the background suddenly the film breaks and you get a laughably bad and somewhat dirty commercial for hot dogs when the movie resumes shes hacking up guys with a sword
action packed  sexy  funny  great conceptstory  rubi malone has been betrayed by a crime syndicate full of degenerates and she wants her revenge
rubi is a loner and a hired gun who will do any dangerous job for the right price
scumbags die limbs fall heads roll and cars explode
parts of this game will make you cringe cheer or laugh out loud
rubi malone is voiced by eliza dushku best known as faith from buffy the vampire slayer or echo from dollhouse
she does a decent job but the story would have been more entertaining if she acted a bit better or a bit worse on purpose and the script was more overthetopgameplay  when the game first begins only a few of rubis moves are available so the game feels really clunky as some of the animation transitions are very rough
the game sacrifices fluidity for speed and for a grindhouse style game its ok  rubi is armed with twin pistols and sword
she faces mobs of henchmen and kills them by the dozens while using acrobatic props
whenever rubi performs an acrobatic move wall run jump pole swing zip line slide dive the game slows down allowing the player to aim and become more effective at killing bad guys
when rubi is in this mode she is much harder to hit
with each bad guy she kills a score multiplier increases giving her more points per kill and boosts a healing factor
the acrobatic gun sword scoring system and health regeneration features all combine to reward the player for aggression
this isnt one of those duck behind a wall games this is a kill the bad guys as fast and as cool as possible games
as you get better at the combat and you unlock more moves the game becomes really fun
there is some depth here that you wouldnt expect
at the end of each level you get a score and you use those points to unlock new moves or improve rubis weaponslevels  there are five different types of levels in the game
they range from great to poorarena levels are large areas loaded with gymnastic type ramps walls poles etc and they are laid out like tony hawk style tricklines
as you play you try to maximize the acrobatic moves as you kill the bad guys
the level ends when you destroy a set number of enemy spawning points with your sword
these are the best parts of the gamequicktime sequences are also in this game
press the right button at the right time to watch rubi do amazing stunts
the timing is generous but if you press the wrong button you dierubi vision levels occur at set times and begin when rubi shoots a guy and gets blood in her face
these levels are cell shaded in red
rubi gets a decent healing factor and is rewarded for chain kills
basically killing guys within  seconds of each other increases the counter
if the timer runs out the counter resets to zero
the enemies have low hp so these levels are a fun change of pace and reward aggressionat certain points in the game rubi flashes back to her home base a junkyard where she runs through timed obstacle courses and shoots targets
every target shot takes  seconds off of her time
if she completes the course fast enough you earn a gold silver or bronze medal
because you dont have to do these over and over they are kind of funthe worst levels in the game are platforming levels
they are loaded with instadeaths and you must restart them from notsogenerous checkpoints
these go against the strengths of the game which is the fast paced combatyou cannot replay levels over again in the story mode but there is a points mode where you can replay levels with maxed out abilities and weapons to try and achieve a high score
if you perform badly in a level while you are in story mode and you dont earn enough points to upgrade rubi the remainder of the game will become much more difficultgraphics  the environments are passable but the character art looks dated
the game gets away with this because it is a game based on lowbudget movies
there is also a scratchy film filter running over the art as you play so the game does feel like you are watching an old bad moviesound  the explosions gunfire and screams of the dying punctuate the battles and the tarantinoesque soundtrack is perfect
theres old school rock surf guitar and garage band music
all of it delivers a perfect grindhouse atmospherehumor  this game will make you laugh out loud and shock you at its audacityreplay value  there are four difficulty levels and a special  bullet   kill mode for the hardcore fans
aside from these and the challenge mode there really isnt any reason to replay the game and for most people one time through will be enoughmaturity  mthe swearing in this game surpasses a biker bar on alimony night and theres enough killing in this game to fill a battlefield after a small scale war
there is no sex or nudity which was kind of surprising
its mrated because of the violence blood and languageoverall  this ends up being a good game for the same reason that you like good bad movies
they arent complex they arent pretty and you just sit back laugh and have a good time
the game lacks features its rough around the edges and there are a few bugs
but in the end it manages to be funbuy it cheap if you love action games or bad action movies and you understand that this is a budget titlerent it if you have  hours to blow through the story modeavoid it if you need high production values like call of duty halo or assassins creedif you enjoyed this game at all get bayonetta
bayonetta is more fluid has high production values its sexier and funnierother great action games include ninja gaiden  assassins creed  and if you have a wii no more heroesthe horror is surviving the controls
i havent played many games in the survival horror genre so i might be biased but ive always found this a problem in the games of this type
its like trying to open a doorknob which you can only view in a mirror and can only manipulate with chopsticks
its simple enough as long as you arent being attacked
as soon as the enemy appears on the screen i tend to assume the combat controls are supposed to make sense which they dont
you have to sort of switch between combat controls and this can be very jarringthe second bone i have to pick with this game is that you can actually save your game after a badly executed battle and have virtually no ammunition and little health left to dispatch of enemies
if you do manage to survive a big battle make sure not to save over your previous save slot unless you know you used your resources wisely
this is a no brainer
but the aggravation of there being few battles to survive where this isnt an issue makes the game very tedious to play
and if youre thinking i may have missed some crucial stores of ammunition and medkits think again
i referred to walkthroughs after the fact and there was almost nothing that i missed up to the point where i stopped playing
the wonky controls combined with the fact that youll have to kill enemies quickly to not die means that if youre like me youll waste a lot of resources rapid firing at enemies as they move around trying to kill them before you or your ally buys the farm
and theres more
most enemies that are slow enough to hit easily take a lot of ammunition to kill
then there are these enormous fat mutants that are one of the first enemies youll encounter
they take lots of hits to kill and specialize in close range widely arcing attacks that take out big chunks of your health and knock you down
if you get knocked down in a place where you cant run before they deliver another attack you might as well just give up it wont even take long for you to diethere is a way to actually recover health by defeating enemies but you dont receive this ability until youve already killed most of the monsters in the first level
i could certainly have used that sooner
and even after you acquire this ability it takes several enemies to actually collect enough to be useful
i liked one ranged weapon which theoretically had unlimited ammo but access to locations where you could restore the ammo was usually limited to when you didnt really need it and it shares the ammo with another weapon if i recall correctlyanother issue is the campus level
this is one of the most confusing areas to navigate
so far i havent really had to face any enemies in the brief time i was there but the problem was i didnt know which door would end the level so i didnt get the chance to navigate it completely getting all the resources even though im pretty certain i couldnt have missed more than oneso far as story goes it seems interesting if improbable
but from what ive read after playing it at least one of the twists could be seen a mile away and would have been more surprising had it been absent
cant say i care much for the protagonists
at times they seem almost likable but are fairly flat and clicheacute otherwise
there may be more to see later but the early game didnt impress me in this regard
the voice acting wasnt too bad considering what they had to work with
i have to give them credit on the atmosphere too
many of the early in game actions make sense only in the context of a genre in which logic is frequently suspended
you might think that a group of people who had prior experience with mutated monstrosities would be more wary of alien flora which leads to grotesque hallucinations
yes ive encountered enough stoner party animals thank you
where are the students who actually plan to graduate
where are the people who upon encountering corpses in the middle of a driveway attempt to call the police and failing that capacity physically go to the police stationthe puzzles were interesting but fairly simple
when i look at some of them i wonder why they require a specialized character to performoverall i wont go so far as to give the game  star because theres a possibility that it might actually be fun with a second player in coop which i havent tried yet and there are some features which it does pretty well with
also dont confuse my review as saying the game is hard to beat though it might be
my primary criticism is that its a hard game to play  if you dont mind adapting to an unintuitive control scheme or more hopefully already have experience with this control style and like it you might actually enjoy this gamelike most horror games the dialogue is as cheesy as it gets
for the wii version the graphics are a little better than the ps version
the camera game controls are horrible especially in coop mode
if you can get past the controls the game can be fun and scary at times
if you really want this game i recommend the ps versionoverall ratingstoryline  as generic as you can get for a horror game
graphics  outdated even by ps standards
game controls  worst ive ever seen
fun factor  get past the generic graphics and clunky controls this game isnt half badive confirmed that the minigames do not use the wiiremote except as a button only controller
id give this minus  stars if i could because it is a misleading ripoff
the review wont let me adjust the two stars i gave it earlieri like wii sports tennis quite a bit but wanted the added ability to move the player around the court
this also had some tennis ball whacking minigames that looked like funsega superstars tennis is imo built more like a button mashing game
take serving for example there is no relationship between the ball toss the ball you see and your racket
instead like a power meter on a golf game you watch a vertical row of stars and the serve hardest when it is at the apex
you time your swing to the meter the ball is not hit when you swingheres a minor thing when you are standing there you cant swing the racket
the racket is not really connected to your movements im not a perfectionist it works well enough in wii sports tennis to make me happyand when you do swing it is more like you are just giving the game a button combo
sure you swing up or at the side and that is read but when you watch the character they seem to simply follow a preset instruction and it doesnt seem in synch with the movement of the wii remote
i want to swing the racket and see the racket on screen move
i have plenty of experience with wii sports tennis and again i am not asking for perfectionthe characters racket swings not only look preset but they are hard to see another reason why you feel disconnectedfurther the minigames
they are as far as i can tell button mashing games only use the buttons on the remote to play you do not get to swing the remote or use the nunchuck
no matter how i set the options for the controller the minigames only allow the buttons and tell you to unplug the nunchuck if you have it plugged inthis in my opinion is not a good wii game
if you like the button mashing type games you may have fun with it
there is an overall game setting for the type of remote you want to use normal remote only the onscreen characters move themselves remote  nunchuck and remote using buttons onlyany comments to the contrary on the facts and ill be happy to alter thisi tend to beat every game i buy
i did not beat this gamethe first time we played it was at a party and it was hilarious
i loved watching our guests attempt to play and loved trying to play it myselfbut on subsequent times we noticed thatthe menu system is irritatingthe sensors dont work perfectly so even if you do it right it will often not sense it  sometimes when you do it wrong it will still say you succeededthey went for a rockband vibe but without rockbands polish  consistencyturok is a game that should have been tested more before being releasedthis game made my computer artifact for no reason my pc wasnt even hot and no other game does thati have played many modern games such as multible unreal  engine games which turok is source games crytek games such as far cry and crysiscrysis warheadthis game is broken triggers mess up
sometimes in a level if you dont run through it just right triggers wont go off and then i end up having to reload the area because im unable to move on
i even had a broken trigger that let me skip the nd bossquicksaves dont work
quicksave will save how much ammo you got but when you hit quick load itll take you back to the check point and you have to kill all the bad guys againodd lazyness
  i notice the grass that you run through are sprites yes spritespictures not graphical models
if i do a  around the grass follows me arounddrive space
 this game takes up a crazy gb of space officially the biggest install size i ever seen
the funnny thing is the game is only  levels long and each level really isnt that long
part of the reason is because there is gb of audio when you do a complete installthis audio includes  different  languages
that still means the game itself is roughly gb making it the second biggest game i ever seen removing the audiowhat is truly amazing with this game is how trivial it looks and how fast it generates a feeling of been there  done that
yes even if someone is new to the turok series  and i am not i came with high expectationsgraphically the game is beautiful yet not very original  and i for one did not appreciate the ever present darknessthe designers probably aimed for atmospheric terror but they obviously overshot their mark
apples and oranges but hitchcock always had his terrors well lit  and that made them unforgettable
there are quite a few cheap shots in this areathe dinosaurs are well jurassicparkrealistic honestly seen any reallife dinosaur lately
 whereas their growls and highpitched packhunting sounds will keep raising the hairs in the back of your head no matter how many times encounteredthe occasional sidekicks ai is neither brilliant nor disastrous
at least it is not a burden remember daikatana anyone
i liked the weapons both the realistic and the futuristic ones
the gameplay is pretty straightforward but i would have liked more freedom in remapping the control keys certain choices are not possiblewhat i particularly did not like was the insertion of a video tp perspective whenever climbing stairs opening doors or killing with the kabar knife
i came across this peculiar approach in another game as well turning point in which it also outright ruined any immersion attemptif i could i would rate it at  stars but decided to be generous the little boy in me is still fascinated by dinosaurs and rounded it up
the game makes par but is probably currently overpricedmy advice wait for its fossil to hit the sale binsi got this keyboard to use mostly for gaming but being a student my computer gets a fair amount of use in many other aspects
if i wrote this the day i got it in the mail it would have got a  but after about  months i am not impressed at all the keyboard now cuts out all the time and i have to go and unplug it then plug it back in to get it to work the rubberized black paint on the keys is starting to come off now and the backlight always turns itself off it worked well for about a month then the problems began and just recently they got much worse they build this thing to sell looks nice and sleek but when it comes down to it this thing drops the ball spend your money elsewhere razer is all about the show no real quality insidekeyboard looks niceand has a slim design
the deal breaker for me was that the usb port doesnt support the  standard so the latest fastest usb thumb drives wont work in addition to slower downloads for anything usb
the keyboard uses two usb slots so make sure you have adequate ports
also the lights lose about half of their brightness when viewed from an angle so unless the keyboard is directly under your eyes the blue keys look blurry and not like the picture
the keyboard is also all black when the power is off or the lights are turned off so you need to keep the lights on all the time unless you have every key memorized thats a personal thing but worth mentioning
the rubber keys are ok nothing great imho
i returned the board spent the money on a high end mouse and kept my original dell keyboard
shop wiselywell while this keyboard has a decent feel it is built very cheaply
extremely flimsy plastic and customer support is virtually non existant
save yourself the hassle and just buy a logitech instead
i expected so much more out of such a high priced keyboardmust play the way and order the game says any differant and u start mission overnever finished playing it i got frustratedi had played this game multiplayer for a few minutes at a friends house and thought it seemed pretty neat
for those who like the angry birds franchise its very similar but with d game play
after playing it for a while there are a few major design flaws that make the game less enjoyable
the primary concern is the freezing of the cursor onscreen
after throwing an object at a target the game takes a moment to catch up to your movements resulting in a frozen cursor
by the time it catches up youre already shaking your hand around and wondering whats wrong with the thing
for the slower paced rounds this is a nonissue
for the games where you have to throw the objects on target and quickly it becomes nearly impossible to complete a level with a satisfactory score
other than that the levels tend to get pretty redundant
there is an ingame level creator though you have to unlock all of the parts by playing through the one player levels firsti enjoy the martial arts and i thought this game had a decent approach  learn martial arts skills without violence
its not a very good game thoughthe game is basically broken up into  minigames with slight restrictions based on what particular form of a game youre playing
for instance in the first koi game you catch as many fish as you can
in the second you need to catch one particular fish
in the third you catch fish as they swim across the screen
so on and so forth
for every belt rank you need to recomplete each of these games at a slightly harder difficulty level and then again during your belt test
all of these are incredibly easy with the exception of the katana games which i find are very unresponsive to the wiimote even for me a really outofpractice video gamer
i ended up as a blue belt about  of the way to black belt in less than an hourit has some interesting options like the naming system and the meditation system which expects you to actually go along with what sensei is saying via guided meditation or just a simple soothing music background while you go it alone
its completely optional but it is a pretty unique featureoverall once you spend about  hours youll start to wonder when youll find something new
unfortunately youll have almost the entire thing unlocked in about  minutes
that really puts a damper on the gameplayi rented this from blockbuster thank goodness
the idea is great but the execution was very poor
its basically  mini games with little replayability
this would have been great if it was shipped the an extra controller instead of wii play
but to pay full price for this is insane
each of the games are unique and fun the first time you play it
but thats it
a game will last for  minutes max
there was no total score for all games played
just the score of the  min round
then you start over again
snorei have played many rts games on the pc including since the original warcraft and dune   on the console ive only played halo wars cc red alert  which were all fun to play on the xbox   i rated this game  stars for fun because its a really enjoyable rts game that progressively gets better the farther you get into it
unfortunately i only got to play about half way into the game due to a game breaking bug
the game froze up the only time it ever did and i had to restart my   when i loaded the game back up my save game was gone
i was not wanting to replay all of the levels over again especially with no guarantee that it wouldnt happen again
due to this i can only rate the game  stars otherwise i would give it a solid  starsthe game itself is decent slow but fun
the support is poor howeverthere is a serial  inside the box
this is a bother but its perfectly understandable
however its the beginning of an adventure or was for meinstalled the game and looked for updates
the update process uses a very sophisticated system it closes the game and opens internet explorer
given that even oneman business like baseball mogul manage downloads within the game this is not impressive
at least you dont have to remember to type stardock then fails to recognize the serial 
there was only one  and two s so it didnt take long to try the variations
the entry form does not contain separate boxes for each number grouping and it does not explain whether to manually type in the dashes
i tried both
i tried to login i own other games of theirs and it timed out repeatedly though my connection was fast and functioning fine
this last could be just bad luck but it fit the experience
from the forums it looks as though there was even a problem with the  update so maybe its best that i have to waitits not a good system for obtaining updates its not a user friendly system for entering the serial number and it would help if their website was functioning properly
if you get the game be aware that your first hour with it might consist of more frustration than funoh the gameplay is decent though you might want to have something to read while you wait between important eventsi barely escaped wasting fifty bucks on spore because rather than getting caught up in the media frenzy around that electronic version of the edsel i waited to see what the reactions of the gaming community were
glad i waitedi did the same thing with sins of a solar empire which just goes to prove the old saw about the bear
sometimes he gets you and sometimes you crap in the woods  no wait
sometimes you crap in the woods and the bear gets you
yeah thats ittake time to understand what you are getting into before you buy this game
to me it was the mutant offspring of a tactical turn based simulation and a fasttwitch real time simulation
galactic civilization meets starcraft meets homeworld
the results were ugly
you cannot pause
you cannot offer the same diplomatic options to your rivals as they can offer to you
fleet control is limited
resources are unlimited so that the game always devolves into one great big zergpit battle
the tech tree is stunted and painfully familiar to anyone who has played just a few spacebased games
the graphics are adequate but it is hard to enjoy what little you can of the space battles as you must hover at a far enough distance to make sure your repair ships havent decided to play hero and charge the enemy dreadnaught for reasons unknownthis game was not for me
i enjoyed galactic civ and its progeny so had good feelings toward stardock
they have saved a total aboutface in regards to the product their company puts out with their outstanding customer support
they really bent over backwards to be fair with me and while i didnt get a refund i was okay with the resolution of my complaintthe royal treatment doesnt make me like the game any better but in fairness while it was not for me it may well be right up others gamealleygame is nice but there is no single player campaign
that means only skirmish mode
what a disappointment that is
why bother with all the story line writeup when in fact there is no story to be played out in the game
it is all meaningless in that sense
very dissapointing in this regard
this is a case of the managment team blowing ithail flaviusthe battles look great when you zoom in but you really cant fight that way because you miss too much like more enemies joining the fight
you basically spend all your time fighting off pirate attacks when in history have pirates ever messed with fleets of warships
there are three different factions you can play but the differences in ships are pretty minor and they play about the same
if there is a tactical aspect of fighting these ships i missed it  seems like you just get them close and watch them slug it outthe real time strategy thing is not really a positive thing in my mind
you end up scurrying around trying to sneak in the research and building in between more pirate attacks
just makes the game feel more harried
after a week or so i stopped playing this  i would not recommend iti recommend star wars  empire at war instead  similar kind of game but more more funplaying this game reminded me a little of playing sw empire at war only worse
i quickly lost interest in this game and never finished more than a couple of levels
maybe this game is better in multiplayer mode but as far as singleplayer mode is concerned im gonna have to give it  thumbs down
play empire at war instead you will not be disappointedwhen i heard about rail simulator i was happy to see a railroad simulator back in the market since train simulator  was cancelled but restarted for a  release
train simulator was a good foundation and the sequel had so much promise
also train simulators minor expansions were a waist
i found the trainz franchise too model like and not heavy on the simulation
i love both however
i grew up with lionel trains and building a decent size layout with my father but our space was limited
even after  years when we first laid out our own track we miss it but dont have the space to rebuid obviously ive since moved out
i am a lover of the tycoon and buisness games and while im not a huge technofile i will knitpick at every little detail of a computer game
so i do love both model trains and a deep simulation
what hurt trainz is its download content manager
it is a pain in the neck to manage and download content even to this day
the speed of the downloading depended on the ticket you bought
if you didnt by the ticket your downloading time was at a snails pace
if you bought a firstclass ticket the speed was way faster
another problem was that you had to search the for the content and the parts to go with it
if you didnt find it all it wouldnt work which would prove ot be very frustrating
it was annoying and involved too much work and sometimes upon loading trainz to play it acted screwy more times after you started to download content
the manual wasnt a help eithernow comes rail simulator
the newest simulation game using the trains theme
the graphics are very vice not stunning but very nice about  notches from being stunning
much better than train simulator and the trainz franchise created by auran
the people and cars are more realistic in rail simulator
unfortunatley the game fails some major aspects
shipped in the north american version  of the routes were european
only one route is from north america california and it wasnt even a passenger route
for people who love to drive passanger trains or complete or build passenger routes this was disheartning and  unbelievable
what were they thinking
even in a pcdvd you would expect a little more passenger routes
the european routes also were mostly nonpassenger
the one i played in britain was soooo boring i didnt even get to the first station it was  miles away
i quit the program feeling very depressed because i was looking foward to the game and with all its hype it left me with a question when will anyone create a great buisnesssimulatormodeling train simulator
dont get me started with sid meiers railroads
i read a few articles that although this is a european game the north american publishers were going to include mostly north american routes and passenger routes as well
this wasnt the case as i was very disappointed
how many times have you counted the word disappointed in my review can you guess if i was disappointed  i was also looking at the website where you can register and download content
not much is available which is ok since the game was just released
in trainz railroad simulator  you can go on the download manager and get nyc subway cars and platforms as well as near lookalike long island railroad cars
none on rail simulators
i was shocked to see no amtrak both as a route included in the game as well as in the download section of the website
when is any train game going to include the nyc subway system the trollies the monorail in the disney area complete with passenger routes amtraks route from nyc to orlando autotrain or how about all routes and trains across all of the united statespart of me is wondering for  seems like they spent most of the money on the graphics because there is hardly any content
since it is a pcdvd i was expecting a lot
sadly i was wrong
you click on  main scenarious and it gives you at most about  jobs
the original train simulator had many more routesfrom startup the installer was perfect and it didnt take long to install
after the initial install the game worked perfectly no crashes and no error messages
i hope people will realize that you cant get away with running a computer with mb of ram and a video card with mb of ram
onboard graphics is a nono
if you have any questions about this or need help dont hesitate to email mei hope more routes will be added as i enjoy passenger routes the most
it would be nice for railroad simulator to appeal to everyone ones who like passenger scenarios and industrial scenarios as well
sadly on this pcdvd the passenger scenarios are lacking as in there are none in north america
the passenger scenarios in germany can all be done in one day not totally but you can get drift and the same goes for britain as well
i gave the game  stars because of the lack of content but with nice graphicsscenery and the fact that people dont look like blocks they did in trainz if you were able to see any
one thing that was puzzling was when i was approaching road crossings the cars never stopped
some disappeared when they reached the gates
in msts you heard the bells go off and the whistle along with the gate going down
the cars also stopped and formed a line in real life
if it werent for the graphics then it would of gotten  star
im still disappointed and hope more passenger scenarios are added in north america
it would be nice to drive the maglev and high speed bullet trains in japan and in germany
what about the monorail in florida from the transportation and ticket center to all the parks and hotels that it stops at which would make a great passenger scenario
i wish i can drive the nyc subway lines dropping off passengers and picking them up
what about amtrakacela auto train also the long island railroad and new jersey transit
train simulator had amtraks acela high speed trainit would of also been nice to see some speaking on the station platforms to announce the inbound and outbound trains and the fact that you see people entering and exiting your train yet you see no movement when you are in passenger mode inside one of the passenger cars
also it would be nice to see some announcements in the trains to let passengers know what the next stop is as well as the trains route
wouldnt it be funny if you announce the trains stops and see some passengers quickly get off with a sad look on their face
how about adding licensing to become an engineer you have to learns about speed limits traveling at high speeds braking correctly at station platforms honking the horn at road crossings and emergencies and if you fail one of these while on the job you can get fired
in other words follow the rules or else you would have to find work at another railroad company
if you did such a poor job or killed someone you wouldnt be able to find another job and the game ends
incorportating a business sim would be interesting
i know this isnt a tycoon game but it certainly would keep you entertained
you could buy locomotives and additional passenger cars and get and increase ridership
you can raise fairs multiple types have to pay your workers ticket agents cleaning crew and mechanics and maintain stations and their platforms as well as maintaining your railyard to make it efficient
you can buildcreate routes in all cities in the united states and canada subway or above gounddid the developers do their homework
did they purposely leave out most of north america
the california scenarios are nonpassenger ones and this is it in the united states
did they purposley concentrate on mostly nonpassenger scenarious for a future expansion
will there be future expansions for north americaconcerning the manual
these days most games dont come with manuals or they have it as a pdf file on the disc
for people who jump right into the game and learn as they go like me it doesnt bother me that there was no manual in the box
for people who do read the manuals the pdf file is easy to access
the minor issue you might have is printing it out and using up your paper supply
maybe the company was thinking that most people dont pay attention to the manual and jump right inperhaps to cut costs
who knows
theres a small pamphlet explaining the controls which is pretty straight foward in understanding
there is a very small guide in the box but you would think since there is no manual inside this guide would be a lot thicker
as for me im waiting for train simulator  but i havent given up hope for this one
this game needs and i hope it gets more content
disappointed yes
given up on it no
hopeful yesi must confess i am not a great fan of simulators
i mean until we manage to rigup an actual holodeck what is the point
over time i tried most of them steering ships and piloting planes and conducting trains  on rainy sunday afternoons in a tshirt and flannel pj pants in front of a  tftpanel how immersed can one get
honestlybut i guess the little boy in us will always be impressed and yearn to be in the helm of great powerful machines
to prove to ourself that we can tame these beasts
so i couldnt resist and gave rail simulator a try
after all it was supposed to be microsofts train simulator successor sharing the same developer and allis it realistic
well i am no reallife conductor so how would i know
it would hardly be fair for me to comment on subjects that i am not an expert on so i will refrain from doing itwhat i can tell you is that the game physics give off an original feeling all right
heavier trains need a long stopping run apply too much regulator and the wheels will slip and one needs to master the reverser to successfully negotiate steep hillsgraphically the game is improved compared to its predecessor the routes are delightfully recreated as are the individual trains  and i especially liked the option to have a freeroving camera instead of just the one following the train
yet it manages to convey a feeling of unfulfilled potential
much better graphics are available todaythe sounds are one of the first aspects that ruin immersion  and made me withhold the first star
true the diesels and electrics all have their own distinctive engine notes and environmental sounds birds and church bells were considered a nice touch
yet like a badly conducted orchestra they managed to miss their mark every time it counts
it makes no difference whether you are in or outside the cab the sounds are the same
and who can hear birds twerping when passing by in a speeding trainwhat really ruins this games potential is the inevitability of crushing bugs  another star missed
when certain combinations of warning signals and speeds coincide back to the desktop
try using the nd map ditto
this one got rushed into the prechristmas market  and it showsthe game comes with a nice and friendly editor which lets you edit the world and even create your own levels from scratch
moreover it is backed by free downloadable content railsimulatordotcom from where one can get free engines carriages some new scenarios as well as whole new editor packs
apparently rs developers are counting heavily on the fanbase to come up with new models and mods
this is supposedly a greatly supported game
now lets only hope they support it with some much needed patches
dont release a halfbaked game and expect the gaming community to do the restfinally such a complicated game just screams for a good ol thick detailed manual
no such luck i am afraid  and this is where it looses its third and final star
i understand that those rsguides are not going to sell themselves  but come on paper is cheap through us a freaking bone heremy suggestion a good game but wait till they fix ittwo and a half years in development this game was eagerly awaited by the train sim community as the title which would redefine the genre after a long gap between genuine new releasesunfortunately i can only concur with previous reviews regarding the buggy and flawed game we have been given
it appears as if all the money and effort has been expended on the graphics engine which does not look a whole lot better than improved mststrainz anyway rather than the core features such as signalling to make a train sim work properly
the cabs are quite detailed and d but not many of the switches or levers work correctly
in external view the train often looks like a sprite floating over the ground and in both cab and exterior view theres a disturbing and nausea inducing side to side hunting of the track which if its supposed to represent the cab swaying is totally wrongsound is not much better
the hst is quite good but the turbo dmu sound like it was sampled from a bin lorry
the deltic is rather weak and the class  just doesnt sound right
theres no distiction between the level or type of sound heard in exterior or interior view either
track sound is awful a sort of disembodied tinkle every now and again or when you cross over points
a gameboy would put it to shamethe north american version is missing the york to newcastle route of the european release with a version of cajon pass in california instead
although the publisher now working under the rail simulator developments  rsdl  banner rather than kuju has stated they will release the respective routes at some stage free or paid unclear this creates an immediate incompatibility between the two versions for third party routes etc
which use objects not found in its transatlantic counterpartone reasonable point which is why it gets two stars rather than one is the train physics
the hst actually takes a realistic time and distance to accelerate and brake though the top end of the power curve is questionable on all the traction
they should just about hold top speed one notch below full power but they want to keep on going
steam physics is about on a par with msts that is to say a reasonable stab but wide of the mark
it does not seem possible to induce wheelslip on any of the locomotiveswhere the sim really falls down is on the operations and signalling
the signalling is poorly scripted and implemented  it does not give proper warning of upcoming junctions and can easily cause your train to derail or collide with another even when you get the correct aspects
the german signalling seems to be derived from the uk signalling and is totally wrong for db practice
theres a lack of proper warnings for upcoming speed limits
the track monitor is useless as it only shows the state of the line about  metres aheadvery few activities or scenarios are included in the box some will have beginners scratching their heads with complex shunting while others are broken as a result of the pathetic signalling
its not possible to run to a timetable and the game shipped without the proper tools to create such an activity
the development tools need to be downloaded seperately and only after signing a licence with rsdl  reason for this is not entirely clear but seems tied up with ensuring any commercial third products sold for this sim pay a royalty fee back to the developer
route building is not as intuiative or easy as msts and light years behind trainz  everything has to be set up via blueprints and the documentation which also has to be registered for and downloaded separately is quite muddy in places and seems more aimed at the technical high end commercial
orientated user than the little guy
the route editor itself is quite buggy particularly when it comes to joining tracks creating junctions or laying roads and fencesin conclusion its a bit of a mess and a disappointment
there is potential there but it will take a bucket load of patches andor a major rewrite of some of the code to get there
at the time of writing feb  a patch is imminent but if youre really eager for a new train sim you might be better advised to wait and see what microsoft have to offer in their proposed new train simulation some time in further playing of cc after my review of it and continued playing of this can pretty much confirm my feelingskane has apparently returned twice
or three times
maybe seventeen
the campaign is all nod and skips twice once taking place before cc campaign once taking place during it and once taking place  years lateras masterfully rapturing as joseph kucan is at portraying kane to a degree where you stare him right in the eyes and never blink the story hes given here reeks of staleness as in concert with the cc nod campaign you begin to think kane is a twotrick pony whose plans always consist of preaching to his children and making them feel happy and loved then making them do stupid things to completely eviscerate any advantage over gdi they may have had or butcher thousands of their own soldiers pointlessly as nothing more than tests of faith
its on display here a few more times from the cc campaignkane seemingly has no real plan in this expansion pack it changes as frequently and readily as the wind and theres always someone new to betray him because apparently all kane likes to do is push his children until they say no and he kills them for treachery
the plots for the expansion pack are rather like tna wrestling booking neither one has much connection to the other and seem to have been randomly hatched out of conveniencethe first act of the story is obvious in kane trying to reunite nod and strengthen it secretly
the second act involves you as the computer system legion doing random things in the midst of the original cc campaign as well as some extraneous work for alexaspoilers followact  steers wildly offcourse and seems almost to retcon the entire events of the cc campaign
whereas cc ended with nod having secured an alien tower to go through and explore the universe act  here is  years after that and nod is still on earth and kane is somehow happy that virtually all his generals have been killed and gdi pretty much controls the planet once againalso they apparently lost the tower or something because its never even once mentioned
the entire story now revolves around a poorly explained tacitus which i only know what it is because i watched some cutscenes from cc tiberian storm and a cyborg army kane had apparently been hiding underground china and russia for  years or so
there is a huge buildup to these cyborgs and how they will be nods vengeance and nods resurgence and how legion will be connected with them to form some kind of insane military force under your commandthe next mission its discovered that these cyborgs are little more than infantry soldiers
soldiers only slightly more powerful than regular militants
they replace the militants and the fanatics but theyre pretty much useless on their own so as usual theyre little more than a wasted novelty and youll be right back to your backbone of rocket troopers stealth tanks and avatars and the likegameplay is completely the same as in the original and unlike expansion packs like yuris revenge which completely revamped soviet technology and added a whole new faction this expansion pack isnt even at the level of starcraft brood war in terms of gameplay changethe only differences thus far have been unit replacements with beta versions or super versions that somehow existed during cc and were more powerful than their original bases yet never ever deployed such as a beta version of the avatar or a super juggernaut which is immobileoutside of the campaign the only major difference ive noticed is the addition of infantry transport for nod and every faction getting a super duper uuper truuper unit in something of the same vein as the titans in age of mythology the titansthis leads to game balance the game balance is terrible
simply terrible perhaps worse
considering how little this expansion pack changes gameplay gameplay balance issues also apply to the original gamegdi is the superpower faction in this game and expansion pack
period
nothing else can compete on their levelthe scrin for all their doomsday presence and sudden shocking appearance and seeming invincibility are in actuality the equivalent of the zerg from starcraft without hydralisks or ultralisks they are a two legged dog with missing teeth
they dont have any heavy units except the tripods and the aircraft capital ships which despite their immense firepower are ridiculously low on hp meaning that unless you research shielding for them they will be picked off against a hefty gdi base defensethe brotherhood of nod has plenty of novelty and expertly wielded stealth technology though in the end their army is essentially broken as their only efficient antiair ground unit is the stealth tank and while the avatar and the super duper uuper titan unit the redeemer are big and scary and can soup themselves up by scavanging from friendly units they are ultimately cannon fodder in comparison to their gdi equivalentsdespite the massive size and massive cost and massive armor hull for the redeemer it is a weak lump of crap compared to its gdi equivalent the marv most especially due to the fact that its fire rate is the slowest of any nod unit in the game and only about  or  times more powerful than a normal avatars base laserand so in the base game and the expansion pack gdi is the superdupersuperpower powerhouse with all the best weapons and best armor and best units for utterly dominating and crushing the opponentscommand and conquer  in general is fabulous however kanes wrath is a dissapointment due to the fact it really doesnt add anything to the game and it doesnt add any new factions either
it just spins off the exsisting factions
go get cc  but hold of on kanes wrathi bought this game recently and had finished the story version in just a few hours
the missions are boring and easy usually the trick is immediately evident and it takes very little strategy to beat the aiabout a quarter of the missions are commando missions so you miss the fun of building a base and laying it to the enemy
no use of superweapons in the main story
very little challenge compared to the regular cc or generalsalso the video sequences had very soft audio and loud music on my system it was nearly impossible to hear what the actors were saying
i skipped most of the sequences for this reason
no matter how i changed the settings i couldnt seem to get good audioout of the box the installer reports an error when installing on computers running windows vista
the error states that the game has only been tested on windows xp
the install continues but it might cause confusioninitial startup gave another error about an incorrect dvd and requesting i insert the correct one
that was fixed by updating the game from  to two annoying installation issues soured my initial impressiongame play itself looks great
resolution maxes out at x
for singleplayer games the ai is hardcharging and very capable
multiplayer is where this game shinesa couple of notes   the northern strike expansion maps are not available in singleplayer mode  ea introduced some rewardmoney system where you can earn credits for upgraded weapons
seeing all the newer weapons but being unable to choose them from the start was annoying and  those walkers are friggin meana hassle to setup but gameplay is as good if not better than bfthey could have made this a truly good game
i played the hell out of  and bf and loved em
this one had all the makings of a good game but they messed up badif you dont play online and unlock stuff youll never enjoy it otherwise
you dont even get grenades at first you actually have to unlock that basic of stuff
terrble
also requires logging into an online account
bf gave you more options didnt require online accounts unless playing online obviously and was a way better game
shame shame shamenot sure if this was right dongle i neededbut it didnt work for ps guitar to play on pi didnt read all reviews so i didnt know
i will still look for right dongle
i think this one was for just to use your controller from ps to ps
be aware when ordering right things
i feel this was my errorthe movie was great
it is defintely in my top  movies for the last few years but this game is just terrible
controls are awful and i cant seem to get passed the early stagesis this a terrible video game
it depends on what your expectations are and how much you paid for it
expecting a good long adventure where you jump through time and space and paying  for it
aside from not having an inkling about how these movie based games work youll be vastly disappointedbut expecting a quick game you can power through for  achievement points and paying  to do so
it deliversits sad that games like these are being shoveled out the door for that very reason to accommodate the achievement junkies and it baffles me to no end when games like this are released with hard time consuming achievements
are developers really that stupid
probablythis fails as a worthwhile video game but succeeds as an easy  achievement points
your satisfaction depends on what you want it forbest way to say it is ok that all and do not buy so not worth it for they moneyman i wanted to like this game
i looked like some sort of fzero ripoff and that was a good game
right
well this game falls short
the touchy and unresponsive controls are where the problem lies
the tutorials are confusing to say the least
the graphics are the only thing that saves this dog of a gamecontrols dgraphics bmusicsound doverall fundit is a hard game to play and there is no way to save the game unless you reach a certain point that means you have to start all over from a distant place in the gamethe only reason i bought this game is because i was looking for a  player split screen having that option is the only reason it even gets  stars
controls  action are very slow paced and unresponsive sound is terrible and has ps graphics at best
not very many weaponse to choose from and really this game is just plain boring
looks like ill stick with rainbow six vegas  for split screen action when friends come over to gameif you havent bought it dont
if i could return it i would have in the first  minutes
graphics  so so
storyline  lame
dialogue  terrible
missions  simple
overall its a poor return for 
unless youve gone through everything on the ps list and are really really bored spend your money on something more rewardingthis game just didnt have the production values of other shooter games on the ps such as cod rsv and resistence
too bad because i was looking for another coop shooter
my recommendation is to wait for army of two and rainbow six vegas  if you want a real coop shooterdo not believe all the positive reviews
do not believe them
the wiimote controls in regards to the brush techniques are unforgivably bugged
you could spend hours yes literally hours trying to get the game to accept a simple circle so that you can defeat a basic monster and move forwardyes the graphics and story are beautiful but the game is broken
you wont notice it right away
youll be happily cruising along probably for a couple of days as i had immensely enjoying the stylized world and the wonderfully altruistic goal of the story
then all of sudden youll get stuck trying to get a brush technique to workyoull try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try
and cry and scream and swear the worst kind of coldblooded curses and revenge on the programmers who designed such a tortuous game to be unleashed on an unsuspecting worldseriously this is how badly this game control is bugged due the complete inability of the wiimote to replicate brush techniques that the game will accept
its totally random
practice will not help because there is no training ground available for you to figure out what works and what doesntfurthermore your repeated attempts even if successful will likely result in a different brush technique being applied besides the one you wanted
so the above paragraph again becomes your own personal digital hell
believe me youll become so disgusted with the game that youll consider joining forces with orochi so you dont have spend any more hours of your precious life trying to get those 
brush strokes to work
updatedi must extend this review to state that the true evil in this game is not just found your vegasodds success rate of many of the brush techniques but also in the digging minigames
omfgih they are the worst the absolute worst thing ive ever tried to endure
 of okami is actually pretty awesome but the digging minigames are like a mephitic blast of necrotic evil from the days of bit horror
the first one you come across isnt so bad but the second and third ones are the best examples of the most finely distilled digital torture ive ever encountered
amnesty international would protest these digging minigames if they knew about themthere are several factors about the second and third minigames that will make you want to break the cd and remote in half take the whole system outside smash it to pieces with a hammer set the pieces on fire and then urinate on the ashes  they have a time limit
i effing hate time limits
i hate them forever
they are not challenging
they are frustrating unnecessary and an extraordinarily cruel and indefensibly lazy programmers technique to stretch out the game play with toothgnashing repetition
this is probably the most heinous thing the clock does not stop when you press b to activate the brush screen
thats right you are not allowed any time to look around you and try to determine the correct path
you are forced into an insanityinspiring cycle of repeated attempts to discover the correct path
the only way to stop the clock is to hit the home button but then you cannot see the screen
uneffingforgivable
there are two brush techniques that are required to finish the game galestorm and water spout and since you have no guarantee of a successful execution on the first try you are irretrievably doomed to waste precious seconds while your repeated attempts fail
you must use slash on the npc to keep them from running into spiky block or pools which either debits time from the clock or forces you to wait while they climb out
ive never used the slash technique on npcs because i was afraid i would kill them
how was i supposed to know that this was possible
using galestorm and water spout are necessary to finish the game however the game give no hints of suggestions of any kind that this is the case leaving you to figure out for yourself how to escape from this vile pit of eternal digital damnationdespite these draconian expectations i managed to find a terrific and very detailed walkthrough for the wii version but even with the printout directly in front of me using the home key as i went so that i could follow each step exactly ive still be unable to complete the third game with kaguya
in my last attempt i actually made it to the bottom
there were no more blocks to break no more obstacles for me to galestorm kaguya across
im just sitting there waiting for her to walk over to the right spot so i can watch the cutscene and move on to more enjoyable gameplay
kaguya finds the spot she becomes surrounded by little rainbow sparkles and the clock keeps on ticking runs out and im told that i have to start over
are you effin kidding me
there was nothing else for me to do
id beaten the game
why didnt the effing clock stop
needless to say in order to attempt this again i know that i know have to expect to fail over and over and then be happily surprised when the capricious game decides to allow me to win
when i finally do im guessing that ill feel the way a prisoner wrongly convicted and set to rikers would feel when after years of imprisonment he is returned to society
it wont be a feeling of accomplishment
it will be a feeling of rueful relief that the long dark days of endless oblivion are over and the sun will shine again
is this how games are supposed to make players feel
i think notwhomever came up with this contemptible digging minigame concept should have their legs pulled apart slowly so that their torsos are torn in half all the while rock salt is poured into the everwidening wound
thats the only thing that i can conjure that would appropriately approximate the reprehensible mental torture that these digging minigames inflict
deplorable programming like this is one of the main reasons that i abandoned console gaming decades ago
most computer games these days have some builtin cheats that allow the gamer to bypass certain challenges that are either extraordinarily difficult because of their beginning skill level or other things that are just flatout effed up
the digging minigames in okami fall into both categoriesyou were warnedpicked it up on a whim since i enjoy puzzles  brainteasers
however certain things quickly became annoyingif you are incorrect you are not told the right answermany questions are repeated identically particularly those involving patterns
this quickly grows dullthe difficulty levels are inconsistant
some difficult questions will be as simple as the easy level if not the very same questions others progress too quickly
math questions rapidly become very difficultvariety was slim
questions become more difficult with levels but the question types dont change
patterns for example involve cards the alphabet and a concentric circle shape
thats itthe memory tests were the most interesting although they also became repetitive
plus since the questions rarely varied what order were these in
it was easy to predict what to memorize for the pictureif you are looking for challenging brainteasers you will probably read too much into a lot of puzzle
for example the x grid on the box cover
the answer is the red square simply because the other two shapes have three pieces
its disappointingly that simplei found very little fun with this game
not thought provoking or intriguing i recommend it if you find yourself stuck in a airport or extremely bored
there are far better memorybrainteaseriq games availablethis game is simply not what i expected
i was looking for more interaction and not only a strategy gameseriously thoughgiven the low number of rpgs available on the  ive been anticipating this game for quite some time now
suffice to say i was excited when i first popped the game in
from the art design to the seamless transition between cut scenes and playercontrolled combat the introduction was impressive
though i didnt have access to skills or magic yet the combat system seemed to be enjoyablemy problem with the game occurred shortly after kaim arrives at uhra
i was starting to get a bit worried while watching the cut scenes featuring the debating uhra council
the dialogue just seemedwooden
i dont know if it was the voice actors or the writing itself that irked me
it was probably a combination of both
come to think of it the only voice actor i was truly impressed with was the one that played jansen
but i tried to ignore it
after all ive played decent rpgs that have had their share of wooden dialoguethe situation became impossible to ignore by the time kaim had his first flashback of the past
i was initially hopeful
the brief cut scene was intense and emotional
it worked
but then the game launched into a bloated short story
the next five minutes were filled with screen after screen of text that transitioned in and out like it belonged in a powerpoint slideshow
that wasnt really the problem
it was the writing itself that rubbed me the wrong way
do you want melodrama
look no further folks
this little gem read like the premise of a lifetime movie except it was written by an eighth grader
id like to think the blame lies on the translation of the game to english
maybe the japanese version doesnt come across this sappybut man is this bad
they beat you over the head with an overabundance of flowery adjectives and clicheacute metaphors all but screaming in your ear this is beautiful and poetic
feel bad for kaim
now
i am sure that some of you out there may know what i am talking about
it was the kind of writing that made me think of christopher paolinis eragon novel
it read a little something like thisthe nighttime dew glittered on the delicate crimson flowers like a thousand twinkling stars in the shadowy midnight sky untouched by the bitter harshness of the cruel world
kaim felt his very soul cry out in eternal pain and sorrow as he glanced at her and saw the shimmering pearly tears gliding down her beautiful milky cheeksblah blah blah
do you get my drift
my friends and i groaned as we struggled through this tripe
we were relieved once it was finally over and the game resumed
but no more than ten minutes later we were treated with yet another flashback story that was even longer and more juvenile than the first one
except this one didnt have the interesting cut scene before it
if i were in charge of this games translation i would have smacked the person that wrote this junk with a giant writing for dummies book
this prose needs some relentless red pen treatment
the emotion they are trying to pound into your skull would have been a hell of a lot more subtle and effective if they had cut out the melodramatic flabfrom what ive seen so far they treat kaim like hes the emo poster boy for immortals
i understand the game is full of these dreams of kaims past
i dont think i could personally handle that no matter how cool the other aspects of the game arei already know some of you may bash me for this review
you may criticize me for rating the game this low without playing it the entire way through
save your breath
i am entitled to my opinion
im certainly not going to play this game the whole way through if i have to be bombarded with wishywashy middle school creative writing projects that take me out of the story rather than immerse mewhat is my final word on the game
if you can stomach this kind of stuff without being instantly turned off go right ahead and pick it up
im sure the rest of the game is really cool
as for myself if i want a dramatic rpg i want one that doesnt try this hard
i want one that conveys emotion without making me want to puke all over my xbox   thanks for readinglost odyssey has great visuals especially in the many and i mean many movie sequences
in the end however the gameplay is repetitive and you are dragged by the nose the entire story line
the storyline is one big clicheacute around the central theme of immortal characters the other themes are the same from every final fantasy game from which it borrows the feel and turn based combat styledue to the very high quantity of videos it feels like something you are watching rather than playing and occasionally the game allows you to play through a couple of combats to give you an illusion of interaction
the voice acting in english at least is absurdly bad and cheesy soap opera style the script of the story doesnt help and the actors must have felt somewhat helpless with the lines they were given specially the interactions involving the protagonist who is trying to be far more serious than the rest of the project
the only truly artistic part can be seen in the poems that appear in the form of dreams although completely devoid of any gaming element they are some of them truly well madewithout spoilers one can only wonder what they were expecting placing characters like the grandchildren in the game
i honestly felt silly through major portions of the story for playing this
the lack of control over saving also makes this a difficult game for the busier player since you cannot be assured that you can play just another  minutes and save
you save when they let you save you play when the movie is done and you fight at every six steps
the combat system is the ff turn based we all know but with a timing mechanism of two rings to create some sort of interaction by the player that while it seems like a good idea it gets boring as hellas a final note the steady progression of the opponents makes no sense at some point you are battling regular soldiers who are still a match to your characters despite the fact that you are  levels higher since the last time you faced themin the end i felt the lost odyssey is a childish game they purred a lot of resources in
it isnt worth the time thoughluckily i rented this title for the wii to see if it lived up to the hype
i couldnt even sit thru this for an hour
you have absolutely no free will in this game whatsoever
you do what they tell you you cant do anything else and then every  seconds your gameplay is interrupted by a cut scene
honestly if youve seen the movie you are following the exact same scenes and theres nothing new
if they hadnt bombarded it with cut scenes and if they had a different story line than the first movie and if they would allow some free will it would be worth checking out
but as it is now rent it before you buy itnot a great game
got as a gift for friends and they dont really play
it is very slow at beinning of game
i didnt care for this game and our friends kids dont really play gamedoing a bit of research there was one really strong reason i chose to purchase the wii version coop
playing more and more games with me like gears  and left  dead my girlfriend seemed really interested in playing this game since she likes ghostbusters and since this version allowed us to play through the story together
unfortunately i grew extremely tired of forcing myself to play this game that i was never able to enjoy playing it with herfirst off this game is by far the best use of an existing license
usual tiein games are just quick and dirty creations made to cashin on any avid fans love of whatever theyre selling
since this game features most of the original actors you can tell they critiqued their lines over and over again until they were just right and fit into the existing ghostbusters universe
also the cartoony graphics seemed to fit the game and characters more so than the highdef character models found on the  and ps versions
sadly this is where i stop praising the game and start cutting it in half
sorryas with most wii games controls are the biggest factor in how i ranked this game
if you played metroid  youre getting a similar experience except now youre in thirdperson as opposed to first
using the nunchuck you move your character in the standard eight directions and deploy your traps
moving the remote moves your aiming reticle and once you hit an invisible barrier on screen your character turns left or right
this was the hardest part to control because so many creatures fly across your field of vision causing you to quickly move left or right to regain your aim but at the same time losing your focus on the creature
there were so many times that the controls caused fighting simple entrylevel enemies into monotonous boring ordeals
also your main weapon  the proton pack  seems weak and practically useless
when fighting enemies you wear down a green bar of active life then enter a minigame to deplete their now red life bar
by pointing your remote and locking on to the enemy onscreen prompts lead you to waggle your remote left right up or down to slam a ghost into a wall or floor and prepare them for capture
in theory this is a great use of the wiispecific motion controls but more often than naught i found myself moving too much where id lose my lockon or not moving enough to the point where the game couldnt pick up on my movementsthis paired with having to restart battles because the camera couldnt keep up caused me to force myself to play this game
yeah forced
if this wasnt  i probably wouldve rated it lower but if you can get past my picky nuances you might have fun
and if youre a ghostbusters fan this may be a collectors item some dayi recently bought this game for a friend and decided to try it out before giving it to him as hes a huge ghostbusters fan
when the game started up i was hit full in the face with lackluster visuals
this wasnt at all the same look of the game id previewed on my ps
apparently the wii version had to make some serious adjustments because the game really does not look good on the wii
but the voice acting the humor and the ghostbusters feel were still there in all their glory
if you own a wii those aspects of this game may be enough to keep you playing until the end
i say that it may be because i am not that type of person
the control scheme for this game on this console was awful
switching between gadgets never felt natural aiming was difficult and even walking often made me dizzy thanks to your turning ability being directly tied to your cursors position on screen
within minutes i decided to reach for a classic controller to see if that would lessen the messy controls only to find that this game doesnt support the classic controller
it was a real disappointment
nonetheless i continued to play for at least  more hours
though i often wanted to put the game down the writing kept me hanging on
eventually though i decided on waiting to experience the full story mode until i obtained the game for my ps
and i intend to
for if the controls had made sense and the graphics had been a little better on the wii then id say this was a good game
you see it isnt the story or the underlying gameplay itself which makes this a subpar experience its the clunky wii conversion which makes it that
in short if all you own is a wii id say rent this one before purchasing
the writing was completely on point
but the watering down of the wii version of ghostbusters is inexcusable
and youll likely find that after one playthrough you wont want to play this game on this console a second time aroundthe game is probably a good one for older more patient players
game play is very hard to control and extremely hard to get on a target
it said two could play but that is only if both have the nunchucks
my seven year old boy got tired of trying to zero in on a target the first day
not recommending this gamethe only good thing i can say about this game are that the graphics are fantastic clearly the best the series has ever seen theres rich detail almost everywhere you look and you can tell the developers put a lot of time and effort into making the game look pretty and not much time anywhere elsefirst of all you cant move and shoot at the same time if you have to pull up your gun and aim you stop in your tracks
it makes it really difficult to kill all the zombies when they start pouring in a room you have to run around to find a clear spot and pull up your weapon or else they will grab youi also found the camera angles really clunky if you turn to run the camera constantly reorients itself away from the action and you cant tell where the attackers are coming from resulting in many frustrating uneccesary deathsalso for some reason if you play coop on the same screen the split doesnt cover the entire screen blacking out the right side on the top player and left side on the bottom player resulting in some stupid distracting checkerboard pattern and no option to turn this off
i paid for a big screen tv i want to use the whole screenanother major problem i found is that the inventory selection takes waaayyyy too long if you need to change a weapon or use a grenade you have to hit y  you can run while doing this either hit left and right to highlight the item you want hit x to select it then another menu pops up and you have to scroll through it the select whether you want to equip combine it give it to your partner or discard it
that is like  button presses if you need something fast and its life or death tough luck youll never have time to dig it out of your inventorybottom line play the demo or rent it before you buy this onethis is not a great game
its not even a good game  just a solidly mediocre one
and who has the time and money for mediocre games
after the towering glory that was resident evil  i anticipated a nigh religious gaming experience and that was what i should have gotten
and yeah before you get all you expect too much on me ill tell you this  if you dont expect a hellaciously good time from entertainment software that runs fiftytosixty bucks a pop youre either eating dodo sandwiches and blowing your nose on franklins or youre waaaaay too easy to pleaseokay before i go into my grievances here are some positives  i like the basic zombie shooting punching and kicking
the twoplayer mode is a terrific thing to put in an re game and the ability to revive your dying partner if you reach himher before heshe sinks to the ground is really cool and dramatic
firefights with gunwielding soldier zombies later in the game are often fun  i was surprised at that actually
the female characters are really cute and it was good to see jill valentine again though i dont like how they narrowed down the womanly hips she sported in the gamecube resident evil remakenow my grievances  most of the maps are boring confusing and dont usually support the gameplay mechanics very well  it seems like theyre either too big or too small
with the exception of one in which you help jill out whilst avoiding an invincible wesker the boss battles are all phoned in the big wriggly snake beast encounters being some of the lamest
all the characters are as blaaah as they come personalitywise they just say the same dumb flat things over and over and over again things like i should have killed you years ago pesky foolish hero
and hey partner were partners to the very end right partner
and what are you talking about villain
youre mad mad i say
its alright to say stuff like that here and there in any action game or movie for that matter but not all the rootin tootin time
and why did they turn chris into such a roid monster
sure he was a big tough guy in the other games but jeeez
and one last thing  the african setting wasnt exploited to even near its full atmospheric potential unlike re which takes place in rural spain and has european gothic flayva to the maxdont tell me this game is at least as good as re because it aint
i went back and immediately replayed it after beating re and it is just so much better
better gameplay better graphics yeah i said it alright theyre not as shiny and hires but they are better better characters better story 
its just better
buy that if you dont have iti did not really like this game i found the camera strange and cumbersomeresident evil  is a much more fun gamei wanted so badly to like re as it was one of the games i was most looking to play for some time now sadly enough i can not possibly give this game a high review simply due to its overwhelming flawson the positive side the game looks great story line is good enough to be a re game but the game is all over the place as to what it wants to be
there are levels that i felt like i was playing re and then there were other levels i felt as if i was playing tomb raider or another random action game
as for enemies in the game while there were a few eye catching bosses and fights nothing was really remarkable and the majority of the bosses have a shoot me here spot which is easily identifiedthe absolute worst part of the game is sheeva if you are playing the game single player and not co op i swear she eats your ammo and power ups constantly gets in your way and when you absolutely need her to do something even as simple as go get an item and bring it to you it seems to take her a lifetime to do it those who have beaten the game surely most know what i am talking about and her character is just annoying with her lines well every character seemed to be in this game especially neo from the matrixi mean weskerif your a fan of the series its worth a play if you are a fan of the old school puzzle style re games stay far away as there are hardly any puzzles to be had in this gamethis was a game that was either hit or miss or so i thought
it falls spmewhere in between
the graphics are beautiful and as smooth as i have seen on any next gen game
the detail uses the full power of the  and the result is impressive
however there are some glichs along the way
they are few and far between but we have come expect such things to be corrected by now
example
when you shoot a zombie and he falls against a wall and half of his body dissppears into the wall and the other half lays there continoulsy twitching
maybe i am knit picking but come on
this is a glich that should have been delt wih years ago
the camera sometimes seems to working againts you
i know this series is not known for it great control scheme but why not improve this instead of using a technology that is  years old
the story is kind of confussing as well
why are we in africa
how did the virus get there
dont get me wrong this is a good game if your a fan of the seriesthere are plenty of the same cliches and gameplay here that fans boys will love
for me i am just looking for something new and different
re is not much different from the original and follows the same tried old story
maybe it is time we give this franchise its last ritesugghh
what can i say maybe lasted  hours because i hate to not give a game a chance
dont care much for set up and restarting constantly because you must restart at checkpoint
the way your character has to pivot
limited range of motion as far as fighting
control set up for weapons blah
positives if you like a labyrinth is so so but you cant kick back and explore how you would wishwith the exception of the minigame called mercenaries and the handtohand finishing moves resident evil  is a downgrade of the series in almost everyway
while resident evil  may not have been a straight up horror game it did have a lot of elements that spooked the heebiejeebies out of people my sister stopped playing the game when she saw a womens head pitchforked upon a wall of a shack  i rest my case
but resident evil  took out all the dwindling horror that resident evil was losing and made it a straightup shooter a bad one at that
resident evil  wasnt a great shooter but the elements of horror scenery and sense of dread  along with a pretty compelling story  made up for a little things such as you cant move and fire and come on nobody complained and 
well there arent many other criticisms about resident evil  because it was a satisfying game and story it was a movie that you could play
now the ugly younger brother resident evil  came along
a different creative director  the dude who did lost planet one and two makes sense right
noooot
i have written lists among lists of az of just creative gameplay elements that totally ruined the game  things that i as a fan were given control over wouldnt have done if i had the power if youre wondering what those things are just ask and i will show you the light and then the story a total bore a total letdown
were talking matrix to matrix revelations here people
bad bad badi am not a hater of resident evil  im not one of those early fanboys who just cant wrap their brains around ganados
i think that ganados were refreshing when i played re
so when i give this game a  its not because im afraid to like new things nor am i going to blindly like this game because its a resident evil game
this game is flawed and its not imaginative
if capcom took the top  resident evil fans of good taste and ask them  things they want to see in a sequel and what they dont want  they wouldnt be able to make a bad game
but the problem is that the creative director and the producers of this game just shut their minds and ignored the fans
and im not talking story so much as i am gameplay although the story is worst of allwhat made ganados so memorable is the fact that they actually did things before attacking you they worked in fields they pretended to be human
in resident evil  the majini were just on you like bees to honey
there was no interaction barely with noninfected
there was no john carpenters the thingesque paranoia of whos infected and whos not  something fans like me have been hoping for for years
theres just nothing at stake in the story to care about until they screwed up the franchise then we care too much in a negative way
i already stated the pros now here are the cons weskers spunky personality and supernatural abilities beyond realism the straightforwardness of the campaign  no rpg elements no point in exploring no typewriters thats an important element to the series regardless of how silly it is
 the weapon inventory the stage select screen resident evil should be a story from beginning to end this new feature allows players to overplay some levels more than others  and quite frankly i see why  because some levels just arent fun
 no merchant bad ai coop makes the game far too simple resident evil should have the option to be single player without ai partner theres no weight of decisions you make at least resident evil  made you think you made differences by freeing that wolf and so forth spoiler ricardo irvings mutation alone was almost enough for me to stop playing the game
matter must come from something other than thin air
jack krausers mutation made sense because he was muscular and it was understandable that he was hiding something inside him ricardo irving just turns into a huge sea creature in a matter of seconds and how did the plagas know he was on a boat
 the unsatisfied death of spencer spoiler the unsatisfied death of wesker the conclusion and the plot holes that explain weskers existence and strength theres no survival horror the only time a vehicle is used the game was onrails it was almost as if paul ws
anderson was the creative director 
that pretty much sums everything elsethe cons just go on forever and ever im sorry to sayresident evil is the scariest game of all time resident evil  is one of the greatest games of all time and this 
this was a mistake and capcom are falling on their sword because they wont own up to their mistake and change the course of the franchisei recommend this game to a nonresident evil fan who likes gears of war
its kind of like the quantum of solance it would be a good action movie if it wasnt the follow up to casino royale
sometimes sequels need to live up to their predeccesors or they shouldnt be made at allthis game was whack
i give it stars for its graphics but thats it
this game cant compare to resident evil  which was a big classic
the online is garbage and nothing thrilling
when i played the oneplayer mode it wasnt scary nor exciting
shava gets in the way also and gets you killed
the online sucks cause your just doing repitive stuff
killing zombies
resident evil  kicks this games athis game isnt anything like the previous resident evil titles
there is no suspense the weapons arent fun to use it looks like a million other games out there
i used to like the way that youd creep around a desolate dark area and sneak up on zombies in the previous versions of the game
this one takes place in broad daylight in the middle east
it got bored with it after a few hoursafter finishing resident evil  i couldnt help but feel a little bit cheated
i think most people who were around to play the first resident evil when it was new will probably agree with me
while resident evil  looks great has good controls and lasts over  hours for most people it is a serious departure from the re games before it
and not in a good wayas others have mentioned this game is indeed an action packed experience that gives you little chance to breathe
the game starts off slowly but picks up momentum quickly and maintains interesting set pieces and graphics that really flow nicely
what bugged me most about it was its complete lack of suspense
every re game before this one made an effort to build a mood and tone that kept you on your toes
not so here
the most effective scene in this game is the very first one where chris and sheva are walking through the town and all the townsfolk are glaring back through dark yellow eyes
its creepy and a very good way to start
unfortunately the rest of the game features countless dudes running from around corners acting as shotgun fodder
there is very little challenge in this game and the ai
is completely dumb
and where the hell are the zombies
arent zombies what resident evil is about
ive never been a fan of the zombies that run around corners and use weapons to attack
when someone is running at you with a chainsaw and a bag over his head he ceases to be a zombie he is a crazy motherfer with a chainsaw and a bag over his head
big difference
zombies are slow meandering lumps of flesh that have no means to attack you other than their dead meathooks
i guess i blame the film  days later for the newer and improved zombie but i prefer the classic george romero zombiebut again there is no suspense at all in this game its all about shooting as many people as you can
which can be fine but in a re game it is not acceptable
and when did chris redfield start lifting weights
he looks like some ahole who just stumbled out of the fitness club
his pumped up meathead look seemed to be an attempt to make this installment a war game only skimping on the horrorwhich leads me to my next gripe
the story in this game is awful
i mean really bad
and the cliches were absolutely astounding
when are game developers going to stop resting on their laurels and deliver a wellwritten game
after playing games like metal gear solid  the story in resident evil  is insulting to my intelligence
lines like welcome to the party or so glad you could make it or i will destroy you
 or this is for our fallen comrades
 ori could go on and on here and resident evil  has them all
the story and dialog is laughable to say the leastbut i suspect people find the true value of this game in its online content
i dont really play online so im leaving my review to the one player experience onlydespite these gripes the game is still a playable experience
i finished the game which says i enjoyed it enough to stick through it
but only barely
honestly there is nothing wrong with the gameplay of re but fundamentally this game misses the mark
to me resident evil  is akin to taking the final fantasy series and turning it into a first person shooter game
capcom took the things we all love about the re series and erased them with bits of other action gamesi would not recommend this game to people who love the re series
they skimp on the horror and beef up the action
and with  games out there like gears of war and halo  you can buy much better action games than this
i really hope capcom goes back to what made resident evil good in the first placesurvival horrori was looking forward to this game after the great experience of re and wow what a disappointment
beyond pretty graphics this game is terrible
the controls are horrible movement is frustrating and the inventory system is ridiculously restrictive and difficult to utilize ingame
the partner ai is atrocious sheva wastes ammo stays  inches from you breathing down your neck and getting in your way and shoots you in the back as often as she shoots enemies
worse than all of these problems is that the gameplay is just not fun
you have to press a button to do anything and everything and levels are short and linear
i could go on but if all the other nonfanboy reviews havent changed your mind then go ahead and blow the  on this gamepeople say you have to play it the way the developers meant it to be played which is ridiculous because the developers should make a game that is fun for us to play we shouldnt give up all expectations in order to fulfill the developers vision of what an exciting interesting and fun game should begameplay is tedious camera is awkward combat is a matter of dash walk dash walk with no run and enemies come out of nowhere and stab you in the back
bosses are impossible to beat
hated this game but loved all earlier games in the series played it back on the dreamcast
very very disappointedthe combat system of this game is painfully slow
populating excel spreadsheets for irs tax audits is more exciting
not at all worth i read somewhere that is like playing a ps game with cleaner graphics
this is the best description i can give this gamethere is nothing new
nothing memorable
nothing unique
it is a wasteright off the bat my inverted controls switched to normal all by themselves caused me to quit the game twice because you have to leave the game to adjust the settings
to do mundane things it seems you need to do require pushing a lot of extra buttons to do simple things the menu systems is crammed and not fun to use and is very oldthe combat is worse as you push x and wait for a circle to complete while you and the ai just stand there and then the game will do a weak nintendo like swipe and thats it
very boring to play and look atif you have a lot of patients some hard core rpg players may find some fun with it
there is so much better executed games out there this is a step back in time to almost ps graphics and game playgraphics are cheap looking but that doesnt always mean a bad game its just the production value here is poori dont even recommend for rent if your time is worth anythingthe game play is kind of complicated also you get an interminable chain of fights that makes the game quite monotonici was really hoping for something absolutely epic when i first heard news about white knight chronicles
the screen shots seemed breathtaking and fighting as the epic white knight was an exciting thought however after dedicating many hours on this game online and off my opinion of it quickly went souryou start the game by creating a custom character
i took a great amount of time creating a character that i knew i wouldnt be tired of looking at because unfortunately you have to buy a key code from psn to change the appearance of your character
what
you have to pay tax to change the appearance
after youve put care and time into creating this character you will soon realize that you are a mere shadow to leonard in the main story
you are that creepy blank staring stage prop
during the game you are able to switch characters to play the character youve created however you are uninvolved during the cutscenes or other side conversations
the only time in which your character has complete attention is during online coop playthe combat system is absolute boredom
you battle with generic commandsslash to earn points ac in order to use combination attacks or special attacks
these combos and specials are much too costly and the ac points take forever to earn back
fighting in this game is more like waiting in line at a bank
it takes about  seconds to regenerate
too little time to switch characters  as the menu style to switch is kind of convoluted  and enough time to be annoyingthe story is cliche and while i was hoping for something new it completely disappointedthe online part of it was fun for a few moments when i realized the missions were almost identical
the towns are also identical as they only give you about  generic buildings and one scene to choose from
if you want something custom youll have to pay for itagainso if you wanted a new game and dont expect anything revolutionary this is the jrpg for youi had high expectations that this game was going to be great
it is made by level  who developed the dark cloud titles as well as rogue galaxy
they have came into their own as a great rpg developer but this one ended with disappointment for me
japan eats up rpgs all the time
their jrpgs is their bread and butter and i didnt take famitsu japanese gaming mag seriously when the game received low scores
i was thinking that when it gets translated that they will fix issues which usually happens
this game though
it was more than that
i just couldnt get past the mediocre story and the dull looking characters
it really took so much out of me
there is an intriguing online component that is very cool but it couldnt save the game for me
i would go into detail and usually i would beat a game before reviewing but i have to warn people to not have high expectations
you might get disappointed
this is deserve a rental firstjust an opinion not professionali really really wanted to like this game but i just could not bring the hype to justice playing it
there are so many flaws that bog this game down not only in the combat system but also the story telling and etc
at first glance the game looks phenomenal
graphics looks great at first sound is awesome level of customization is wicked cool geonet is a great addition but after a couple of hours of wkc you wont be so wowed
i love rpgs but wkc dissapointedthings i liked sound the ost of the game is pretty great something along the lines of shadow hearts if anybody ever played that game and the voiceovers are pretty well done despite not matching the lipsync of the characters customization you can mold any character you want into whatever class
some characters can absolutely not use a certain weapon but there is still tons of customization
you can set your commands to anything you want and create combos
combos are pretty neat as you can make a combo out of any attack you want
getting skill points and spending em is always fun in any rpg and this game definitely gives you a lot of skills to purchase white knight transforming into the white knight is pretty sweet
hes pretty huge and it feels cool cause all the other party members look so dwarfed with the white knight roaming around the battlefield
it gives you the feeling of being powerful
simply put you feel like a badass dishin out his strong attacks
i just wish you could stay as the white knight for a duration of time other than reverting back to human form every time you defeat the party of monsters you were attackingthings i didnt likestory telling  i would like to explain why i am not interested in the story at all but i dont really want to spoil it for anyone still pending a play through
lets just say characters are very one dimensional and a certain one changes way too soon
your character has very limited involvement in anything story related and heshe feels so out of placemonsters and environments they are very plain with little attention to detail
wherever you go youll see the same kind of monsters just with a color palette change
usually this doesnt bother me but when you got a boring battle systemill get to that next and the same monsters keep showing up in the bland environments it starts to make you sleepybattle system the battle system is boring and flawed
you pick your command with the dpad wait for a circle to fill up and then attack rinse repeat
its another thing i generally dont mind in other rpgs its just the effects could have been a little more exciting to make up for the boringness of waiting for commands
most of the spell effects seem so generic
if the special effects could have been a little more over the top then the battle system wouldnt be as boring final fantasy anyone
generally when you are fighting it will tell you youre too far away but it doesnt give you a good idea of how close youre supposed to be because all it gives you to go off of is a picture that disappears when youre close enoughbottom line i really didnt play much geonet so i have no say in that part of the game but it was ok for the most part
it could have been great if given a little more polish before releasing
i would definitely rent this if you can i dont have a video store here 
there are better games out worth investing  dollars onwhite knight chronicles international editionextremely boring game i fell asleep twice
the battle system is horrendouslong loading times makes you wish ps had a similar disk install like xbox  hasthe graphics is ps in hd quality like those remastered ps games sly collection gow collectionlets hope that wkc will be much betetrmafia ii is a bland game
the missions have you moving through buildings and shooting enemies with a manual aiming mechanism
the city is lifeless and dull theres not much to do between missions but stock up on weapons
the storyline is a derivative mishmash of old gangster movies a young italian immigrant named vito returns from ww does some odd jobs for the local mob boss advances through the ranks by taking out his rivals until he eventually predictably becomes mob boss himself
there are also timeline errors the game is set in  but rock n roll songs can be heard on the radio and slowdown
dont be fooled this is not a gta clone
its not that ambitiousmafia  isnt the open world game youd initially hope for but it doesnt have to be
in reality its a story based game with some freedom added to it
it always the game to focus on its mafia driven storyline wish trumps most games
the truly top notch voice acting makes you dive into its crime driven world
unfortunately for everything the game does right on that regard i felt more often than not truly bored with the game
while the shooting mechanics are passable the driving drove me insane
i spent as much of time driving to the location as i did actually shooting and doing missions
it would be fine but it takes a large portion of the game and eventually becomes tedious
its a shame cause the missions are truly diverse
the visuals in the game arent exactly high class
the city is mostly empty characters are just ok but textures arent detailed and overall it really isnt an impressive game to look at which is surprising
mafia  is a short game no question
itll take you from  hours to beat and there is very little incentive to come back especially since the story pretty much ends
overall mafia  is a great game that demonstrate how far games have come in delivering cinematic experiences
it also does a step backwards in the gameplay department and overall didnt feel like much funi was one of the people who had been following the developement of this game for quite some years now
being a fan of all things mobster mafioso and the like it was on the top of my listbut i have no idea why it took them so long to come out with this gamebecause theres really not enough hereand the game itself is revolutionary in no way whatsoeveryou drive from mission objective to objectivedrive some more shoot some guys and thats itthats alland the story is really not as spectacular as they make it out to be
you can rob stores and customize your cars surebut robbing the stores is waayyyy toooo easssyyy to the point where its boring after the rd time you do it
also why in the world is there no free roam save feature
the only time you can save is when you advance the storywhich makes absolutely no sense
why cant i go out for a day of robbing stores customizing cars and the likeand then save my progress without being bothered with the story
this would have given the game alot of replay valuebut to make things even worse once you beat the game you cant play it anymoreyou have to start overnow this would be tolerable if the storymode had multiple endingsor atleast multiple paths you could take each playthrough to get to a single endingkind of like mass effect where the choices you make along the way effect the characters and things around youbut mafia  has none of thisyou will get the same missions and ending every single playthroughbecause you love de boringgodfather  had extortable rackets bombing shops gang wars game saves robbing banks and so onmafia  has none of this
not to mention godfathers map is literally  times larger
its puzzling to me how mafia  took none of these features from the godfather series and then put out such a lackluster game with literally nothing in iti just dont understand itoverall the games graphics and atmosphere are awesomethe game really feels like nyc in the sbut gta true crime nyc and godfather have already conquored the ny theme with just as much feelingand youd be better off with any of these games instead of mafia  rent this game if your curious but buy the godfatherill i loved godfather   i loved godfather   to a lessor degree
godfather  gets kudos for how involved the player must get with controlling all the several properties and employees
mafia  is way too linear
you follow missions and then the game is over
no feeling of building an empire or exploring the map or really anything
it is a title that to me disappoints
i think i finished it in about  hours
i have never finished a game that fast
and when its over it is over
no option to continue to horse around staying in the game and continuing to run your empire
nope game over
i would not rate it better than one star if it were not for the background graphics and music
it just lacks that ability to draw you into the storyand keep you there
i kept thinking as i played it that i wish godfather  looked this good because it was such a better game too play and that this one not so muchin shortmafia  has so much driving for no apparent reason
godfather    had you drive to build up to somethingmafia  looks open world but is not as it is all missions
it is pure storyline that you must followmafia  has excellent background graphics and music
its characters however look like something from godfather   very dated graphics on the peoplethere are no joints to control or payouts to collect or any such feeling of true organized crime like was created in gf   somewhat in gfway too many cut scenes that go on foreverway too short a gameit reminded me of the godfather movie trilogy where mafia  game is like godfather  movie
it just doesnt measure upupdate   i popped the game back in just to see one more time if theres anything to do after youve completed all the chapters
nope
i started certain chapters over and i tried different things like robbing stores buying clothes and guns stealing cars
theres absolutely no point
money is really only needed to complete a mission or two  which was already done
theres no rackets to control or even hookers to pick up
and to make it worse the game stopped me in the middle of one of the ventures
i had been stealing cars and having shootouts with police and just generally trying to see if there was any fun factor in replay theres not when the screen popped up mission failed and sent me back to the beginning of the chapter never having saved any of that side stuff i did
it was not a timed mission i was supposed to be on but i guess the game didnt want me not doing the mission
i took out the disc and it now sits in my sell it pilelike i said above it is purely mission based  point a to point b  maybe im missing something here but i thought the game could have been so much more
its like they had a great idea with so much attention to the background graphics and then they just dropped the ball
godfather    are so much betterif im missing something here  if there is some cool stuff you can do after having done all the missionschapters  please tell me
i drove around forever but there just doesnt seem to be anything you can really doshort of collecting wanted posters i guessmafia iiwhich has absolutley nothing to do with the first gameis pretty dullall there really isis a storyline which isnt all that greatand walking around picking up old playboy magazinesthat can be viewedthe cover only in the main menuthe characters in this game are not very likeable and the gameplay tries too much to be like gtawithout all the little side missions of coursethere are things about this game that could easily offened alot of peoplesuch as using strong ethnic slangs regarding italianirishafricanamerican and chinese peoplethis game also contains alot of nudityplayboy covers as welloverallmafia ii may be worth a rentalbut i wouldnt recommend a purchasebecause after you beat ityoull probally just end up selling itlike i didor itll just sit there in your collectionhonestly i went back to playing to playing red dead redemption which i first thought had silly characters
but after playing mafia  i realized i much preferred red dead redemption because there was a lot more to do in the western cities side missions or just go around and creating some chaos
mafia  has beautiful graphics a great looking city pretty nice looking cars that drive pretty good and a promising storyline
but the whole environment is pretty baron
the thing i loved about the first mafia on pc was the open environment the crazy cop chases shoot outs with the bad guys in the streets and in their black cars
that to me was a great game in itself
i even like the cop interaction better than in gta
but in mafia  there isnt anything to do
the cop chases are not interesting there is no free mode or shootouts or side missions to do
and that only leaves the missions which to me became boring because i dont like the control mechanisms and the straight forward linear shooting
they seemed to take a big step backward in that regard
on the other hand i love the dead aim shooting on rdr push down the right stick slow motion and dead aim  shots to the head torso even when riding a horse and the other guy is riding fast to catch you
sorry i keep comparing these two games are the two big open environment games of the year and one secedes and the other fails
mafia  still has potential if they took the great graphics the ai all the technology the city and reworked  it into a funner open end game with more things to do better shooting mechanics better free mode and put the elements back into the sequel that made the original so greatwalk through corridors
then enter big room and fight ghosts
repeat ad nauseum while looping the same piece of musicthis game was a letdown
bad  repetitive level design uninspired gameplay and a snoozer of a plot
if this story was supposed to be a ghostbusters movie no wonder they scrapped it
aykroyd is the only actor who sounds remotely interested the others are just mailing it inbargain bin purchase at bestthis game is riding the coattails of soul calibur ii
its not as well designed or tactical just more colorful cracked out and character overloaded
the women are great thoughit was ok but didnt much care for it i think ill stick to mortal kombat its a way better fighting gamei know  will be out soon but  is okay and a decent gameits cheap so buy if you want a fighting game for cheapdisclaimer even though this game was released in  i am reviewing this game according to my present standards for the benefit of someone who hasnt played this game before and is looking to play older titlesconceptcole was just a courier in empire city until he became an unwilling scapegoat when a package he was delivering turned out to be a bomb a bomb unlike any other seen before
aside from causing mass casualties and destruction cole was imbued with strange powersspecifically to be able to absorb and control electric energy and use it at his disposal
the bomb has also created a sickness that prompts the government to quarantine empire city indefinitely
with riots and lawlessness in the streets cole decides to use his new powers to clean up the streets and find out who was behind his framing him for a terrorist
how me plans on achieving those goals is up to the playergraphicssoundthe graphics are on par with what was being released during that year if not maybe a little rough here and there
empire city looks  the absolute same regardless of what part of the map you are in generic skyline building structure etc
using coles super powers is pretty cool to look at but thats really it as far as what stands out
the music and overall sound of the game is pretty solid although the dialog is very cliche and hokey throughout
i find this terribly annoying in some games and infamous is no exception putting effort into making the main character look good graphicswise then obviously halfassing it for every other npc in the game whether or not they are part of the plot
i can understand when its done for npcs that are there to simply populate the game but the actual characters that cole interacts with on a regular basis look horrible sound lame and their movements are clunky and robotic
if i were to guess id say that whatever code was used for their movements was taken straight out of the first resident evilgameplayfor me this is where the game really suffers and i apologize in advance if i start going off on a tangent
character movement of cole is very rigid and nonorganic and the horrible camera function just exacerbates the issue often swooping around during midjump and throwing off your perspective
scaling buildings is extremely frustrating and not nearly as fluid and organic as the makers claim it is
oftentimes when i would try to climb something like an electric post or jump onto a ladder against a wall the character would constantly jump right past it  over and over again until i had to position the character right in front of what i was trying to climb and finally he would interact with it appropriately
cole needlessly climbs things that you didnt need him to climb which causes a lot of headache when youre being shot at by a mounted machine gun and instead of hopping down to get behind cover your character wants to skip from mailbox to mailbox right in the firing line
oh and that reminds me if there is one thing that cole is good at its dying
even when leveled up completely cole loses health and dies with some serious regularity when being shot at which is odd for a character that can jump off a  story building without a scratch
oh yes and despite him essentially being a living electric conduit with voltage running through his entire body being too close to one of your own electric grenades results in death
death always results in you being transported back to a single respawn point in the map until you unlock more medical centers where you will just spawn to the one closest to where you diedother than the above mentioned shortcomings the gameplay is pretty basic openworld map where you can choose various missions to take part in and complete
as you finish some missions you will be rewarded with new powerups for your special skills
other missions you complete with make the zone the job was in safe and no more enemies will pop up there
mission types break down into  categories good neutral and badpretty self explanatory
a lot of like fable before it and many other titles since infamous allows you to choose missions andor make decisions that determine your moral compass and how other characters perceive you
some powerups are only available for a really good character and likewise for anyone who dedicates themselves to being a right prick to pretty much everyone
aside from balancing out your goodnessevilness the missions are a bit repetitive at timesreplay valueif youre like me i always like to play as the good guy on the first run then be an outright tyrant the second time around
unfortunately the hangups on gameplay are something that can be quite tiring so i would give this a moderatelow replay valueoverallvideo games have improved so drastically over the last few years that some just get left in the dust compared to others
infamous is a title that gathered enough momentum to warrant two more games under its umbrella so obviously its not the total failure i may have made it out to be
like my disclaimer states i critiqued this game based on my present standards because very few video games could be considered timeless and infamous to me isnt one of them
its not a great game but its not unplayable either
if you want to play the sequel and second son which looks amazing then it stands to reason that the plots would make more sense and the feel would be more genuine if you start from game one
another thing worth noting is that i experienced absolutely zero glitches which is a bragging right that a lot of the bigger and more successful game companies have never hadi rescently bought this game and im  hours into it
so far nothing has gotten my attention
weak powers in comparison to prototypebuildings look the same people look the same it feels like youre running around in cirles
the graphics are great thats why i gave it  stars
but other than that its really an infamous game
try the real deal prototype where you can actually rip a city apart
not recommended as a purchase but as a rental
im trading this crap in tomorrowi purchased the ps game the last of us
i thought it was well done captivating creative and polished
i tried a few others thinking that other games were playable by adults as well
i got the drake series because they were all  for  bucks not too bad but too much console clicking
great game play most of the time until you get stuck
now this game infamous is really bad
i can not believe it has such ratings
you run around and mindlessly try to electrocute stuff
you should hear the voice overs non intentional comedy
just not funny
i played it for  mins and said that is enough time wasted
i wish i had never bought iti was excited to purchase this game and couldnt wait for it to arrive in the mail
a  starrated game for an excellent price
a man with electrifying powers
the striking blue neon color of his weapons against the dark backdrop looked awesome
thats what initially struck me
the more i played however the more i realized that i needed more than his unique powers to keep me entertainedwhat this game severely lacked was diversity
diversity of enemies diversity of settings diversity of missions
unfortunately no matter where the main character turned everything looked the same
the word monochromatic comes to mind
all the buildings looked the same brownishgrayish color
the streets looked dull
the enemies especially in the st half of the game were extremely dull
they just run around shooting at you in their big red coats
they never said anything though
they lacked detail
even up close they didnt seem to have any true personality
they didnt appear evil to me
they were just annoying
it wasnt any fun killing them because i didnt hate them for any particular reason
i couldnt immerse myself in this game because i couldnt connect with any of the characters
even cole the good guy trying to save the world annoyed me after a while
he spoke solely in a low husky voice
i could never get a feel for who he was
his best friend who at times tried to be funny was not funny
maybe its because this game took place in a desolate dark environment not conducive to anything cheerfulive never given anything ive purchased on amazon less than  stars
in fact i believe i give most things a  or   but because i kept saying to myself i cant wait to finish this game so i dont have to think about it again i had to give it  stars
there are some more satisfactory moments
the final battle is probably the best scene of the entire game
if they used more of those elements in the game it would have been a lot more funtheres one part where you have to take down a weather balloon to prevent it from spreading a deadly gas across the city
sounds exciting right
but its not
you have to wait on top of a building until the balloon gets close enough to you so you can jump on it
sometimes that doesnt happen for minutes
so youre just waiting and waiting
very annoyingi stopped playing the side missions because they were repetitive and didnt add anything to the story of the game
i finally beat the game and according to the statistics im only  done with the game
thats because i left out many of the side missions
this game felt long to me
i am surprised some people claim they beat it in  hours
how
maybe if you do zero side missions and are on a second playthrough
it took me about  hoursso in conclusion this game has some cool aspects like the graphics when cole uses his electric powers and the final battle
but the rest of the game is dull in color dull in missions lacking in dialogueand when cole does speak as hes running around the city i dont even notice his lips moving has annoying as opposed to evil enemies and has characters which i wouldnt like if i met them in person
ah one more thing that annoyed me the autosave feature
i would play for  minutes killing everything in my sight get to the next cutscene play for another  minutes and die
you would think that the game would resume from where the cutscene left off
but no
i had to repeat all of that
it seems that sometimes you have to complete the entire mission which could take half hour or longer otherwise the next time you turned on your ps youd have to go waaaaay backinfamous  is set to come out in december of   it will probably be a lot better than this game but because cole never drew me in to his struggles his life his mission im not sure i care enough to get part   i might change my mind depending on the reviewsi notice that the negative reviews for this game get no love
most people answer no to the question did you find this review helpful
if you feel that this game deserves a  or  i can see your point
this game is a lot of fun for some people
but that doesnt mean that you have to get upset with the people who dont agree with you and rate their reviews as unhelpful
we are all entitled to our opinionsi bought this game knowing its one year old and i expected to have a dynamic gun shooting game in an open world
it reached my expectation but its not one of the games that i will remember after a few yearsthe graphics are little dull
enemies are repetitive
and the missions are boring for most of the time
i have played hundred games and this is one game that i felt does not live up to its hype
why do so many people like iti plan to use a week to plat this game and quickly turn to another game because life is just shortbionic commando is a game that barely delivers an engaging gaming experience let alone takes advantage of the platform and action scenarios the games concept promises
the controls are flimsy the graphics and sound are underwhelming as a whole and the game is severely flawed in its designdesignthis is arguably the most important aspect of bionic commando due to the advent of the bionic arm and how its implemented into the platform and action sequences
unfortunately this is where bionic commando truly fails
the crumbling postexplosion rubble of ascension city seems like a proper setting for your bionic arm but the design is immensely flawed in that your movement is incredibly restricted
the city appears to be open but as you travel the various roads and buildings youll find that the developers have given you one linear path to each checkpoint
not to mention each section of the city youll play ends and begins in a tunnel
both water zones and radiation zones restrict your movement throughout the levels never allowing you much freedom of choice on how to approach enemies and checkpoints
another design flaw is in the checkpoint system itself
checkpoints are determined not by new areas or cinematic sequences but by clearing enemy spawn points
one of the only positive aspect of the design is that you can grapple almost any surface you see with your bionic arm which does allow you some freedom to maneuver the linear paths in your own waygameplaybionic commandos gameplay mainly consists of grappling and shooting sometimes separately sometimes at the same time
there are segments of the game that are strictly platforming
these segments are the most tedious sections of the game resulting in the most deaths especially in the beginning when youre trying to get used to the awkward controls
there are a slew of on foot shooting missions although grappling can be implemented and taken advantage of during shootouts
one of bionic commandos only bright spots is the use of the multiple uses of the bionic arm during enemy encounters
however the enemy ai is incredibly weak resulting in incredibly easy firefights
herein lies bionic commandos problem within its gameplay the shooting missions are tremendously easier then the platforming missions and the game never finds a proper balance between the two
there are some varying environments that youll encounter including a cave system and a jungle but most of the action takes place in the rubble of ascension citypresentationbionic commandos environments are definitely its best graphical attribute
they are rendered well and showcase some decent texture and lighting effects
in saying that the character graphics are a little less impressive the models are rough and the animations of the enemies often appear very jagged
overall the graphics are decent enough for a nextgen title but underwhelming as a whole
sound wise the game is also unimpressive as a generic techno rock track plays out during many enemy encounters while a pseudo symphonic track plays over the platform missions
gunfire from both enemies and commando sound very weak even the grenade and rocket launchers have no real feel of power behind them
bionic commandos presentation is passable but sorely lacking when compared to most nextgen titlesfinal wordoverall bionic commando is a dissapointment the graphic and sound presentation is subpar especially coming from a company as well regarded as capcom
grin developed it the bionic arm is implemented poorly by bad controls and weak level design
although it can be fun and challenging at times the game never finds a proper balance in its execution resulting in a less then stellar final productsimply put i like this game though i far from love it
its single greatest strength is the game play mechanics of the bionic arm
the arm serves as both a weapon and a means of swinging from place to place which for me was allot of fun while being very challenging
unlike games like prince of persia where you just hit a button at the right time to link your next acrobatic stunt in bionic commando you have to time your swings and line up your next swing with much precision and grace
personally i enjoyed the challenge of perfecting my swing because it is lots of fun and soaring through the air has a sort of innocent quality that i very much enjoyed
though the negatives are a lack luster story mediocre graphics though the environments themselves are well put together the textures are just nowhere near as sharpclean as they should be and somewhat boring combat
the combat plays like an arcade shooter from  no cover system similar to gears of war or drakes fortune is sorely lacking and a very very basic ai hinder this game from being memorable in light of far more advanced games available on the market
but hey for less than  bucks its worth playing this game to experience the unique and distinct swing mechanics that is if you have the patience to master itbionic commando was a game i really looked forward to for a while
it has a lot of potential since it essentially looks like a fastpaced actionpacked version of spiderman   i say this because webswinging was revolutionary in spiderman  so its the best comparison i can makei was sorely let down with the gameplay in bionic commando however
first off the controls took a while to get used to
nothing was quite fluid enough to enjoy for quite some time and even after i got the hang of things i wasnt really enjoying it the way i expected to
just expect to die
a lot
im a seasoned gamer i play my systems every day and i love a challenge dating back to contra on the nes
but this game wasnt challenging it was irritating
things just dont work the way you want them to at most timesi would imagine if i played this game for about a month every single day for at least an hour or two i might be more comfortable with it
however im not willing to invest  hours of work in trying to enjoy a video game
i respect those who have overcome this barrier but if im paying for a video game to entertain me it should entertain me out of the box in my opinion
learning curves are okay but this game simply was not fun in playing itand i did try to enjoy it for many hoursoverall the d rejuvenation of bionic commando is hardly rejuvenating at all
it leads to a great deal of frustration because swinging and combat just dont control well enough in d space
the game was great in d but in d a better team needs to work on the controls to make this one shine
it has the potential but just doesnt deliveri really do not care for this game
ive played it for a couple of hours total and i havent touched it again
its so boring
i would not recommend this game to any of my friendsgaming buds
my cousin did play it and she likes it so someone else may like it
i however did notif you enjoy sitting through the same cutscene over and over which cant be skipped youll probably love this oneoh  i forgot to mention you cant save your progress after completing a challenging section
the game decides when you get to save
that means you will do the challenging sections over and over and over again since every time you die you go back to the last autosave pointbut my favorite
after you die and youll be dying many times you go back to a loading screen that takes about  seconds
whats loading
it was already loaded before i diedi played it once got pretty bored as everything was pretty repetitive
when purchased amazon had it labeled as  players
its a single player gameseriously sony
you can do better than this
repetative levels
below average audio
crappier than normal voice acting
stupid ending
this game was a huge let down
the first two were much better
there is no need to play this game at allalthough i have not purchased the full game ive played the demo and dont like it at alli dont understand why sony took so long to release an unimpressive game as far as game content goes
a linear game you can beat in  to  hours should not be retailed over  usdid get this game until it drops under  as its still a ps exclusive game
if youve played bayonetta dantes inferno this is just like it  pushing repetitively the same couple of buttons until you reach a cut scene and eventually the ending of the campaignone of the nicest looking ps games i ever seeni would give it a rent first see how you like it its a masher so expect to hit things hundreds of times and you dont get to fight how you want to you must always do it how the game dictates no room for creativity which is a big disappointmentthis is very much controlled like a ps game
you cant look around at all
you cant look at your objective either so you will be leaping blindly at walls waiting for a spot where it garb on and it looks silly
the game takes full advantage of the fact the controls are terrible at your expense
you will find your self walking one way only to have it go the other directionas nice as it looks it can be a pain to play
you have to be so precise even to climb a simple latter that you will end up doing the same thing over and over just to have it open a chest or climb or what ever
if its a timed moment forget it sometimes it takes  tries just to get him to grab on to what ever or make the icon appearremember sony paid huge dollars for the review scores in the form of advertising dollars to gamespot  etcvery disappointingrentalinitially i was very impressed by this game
the graphics are without question some of the best ever on a console and the opening sequence that centers around a battle with poseidon while you ride on the back of a foottall titan is admitedly breathtaking
unfortuneately the rest of the game is a major letdown
it never again reaches the graphic heights of that sequence nor does it have any other ideas which feel as compelling and originalcompared to kratos two prior quests this one feels oddly aimless and uneventful
there are very few moments of surpise and awe like in those games instead things become rather dull and predictable with kratos hacking his way through a series of generic faux classical environments
the story is a complete mess of inconsistencies attrocious dialouge and convoluted plotting
it is mindboggling that a game of this stature has a script this bad
 spoiler warning at the end of the game it is revealed that the power that has driven kratos all along was hope and that hope is what we fight with when we have nothing else
i almost gagged when i heard that
not only is it the height of banality but it also completely contradicts everything that has been established about this character
spoiler so in conclusion this is a graphically impressive but largely uninspired installment in the god of war series
i would say it is worth playing through once but i will be selling my copyeverybody raves about this game at the time
i was excited to get it but just never got into it
the graphics where really nice and the cut scenes amazingi really dont know how this game won graphics of the year cause they suckthe camera angle is like ft above your guy so its stupidalso the bosses are so hard and take for ever to beati played this game time and i regret buying itusually when buying games for ps i read reviews and then decide if game is worth spending cash and time
gow series had positive reviews so without any doubt i ordered italthough graphics are astonishing and story is awesome at the very start i realized that i can move only one way and my camera is fixed
really
no i couldnt believe it so i went and played for hour two trying to find any reason why i should stay and play till the end
no way i could ever justify that with all modern improvements in the gaming world still so promising game is such a disappointment
furthermore fights with bosses are basically not about brains at all but it is about how far you can go without breaking your controller my suggestion to creators of gowiii  in future please put a sign on the cover not for younger than  and older than gave up after playing for  hoursnow when i am looking to buy a new game i read reviews and if it sounds like gow iii  i know it is not made for meim not going to go into too much detail about the good stuff of this gameits pretty much all there in the positive reviews
this review is more for those who have to think twice about shelling out sixty dollars for each of these games which in my opinion does contribute to the overall rating of the productthe main criticism of this game is as follows why in this day and age with the power of the ps does this game have fixed camera angles
it is essentially still a sidescroller
if you have played the previous versions it is pretty much the same
not that you really have to for game play but there is no ability to explore the environment
sometimes you just want to be able to look aroundfrustrating at times
this also affects combat scenes since you are unable to get any different angles on your enemiesperhaps not a big deal to some but this was the one change i was expecting from the newest version on the ps
in fact if you were to randomly change between gow  and the god of war collection god of war i and ii remastered for the ps which i also own and have played through i am willing to bet that most would be unable to figure out quickly which game you were playing outside of a few minor differencesagain the purpose of this review is not to bash this game
i love this series and gow  is a fun game to play
but is this a significant enough upgrade to be shelling out top dollar
as a god of war fan definitely worth owning but not at full price
get it a a discount and i think you will be less disappointed with the value
therefore  star rating at full price  to  stars once the price dropsthe campaign i should open with that
games that are not explicitly online multiplayer eg
battlefield series should have a strong campaign that is more than a extended training system for multiplayer
i often felt so frustrated when i couldnt get past a part driving the tank across the ice while being bombed after several tries that i had to put the game down and play something else or just read a book
while the story was much better than i had expected it left a lot out and sometimes just made no sense the lab did the humans create the locust
i couldnt tellthe game play was ok there was enough variety in weapons to be fun without being confusing though i played most of the game with only the chainsaw gun and sniper rifle occasionally a grenade but never a pistol unless i ran out of ammo for everything else but the game just felt lacking
i know vague but much of the game played the same way get under cover fire until everything is dead find next cover repeat
the few times when you were given a chance to ride inon something ended quickly and at times mind numbingly frustrating
the ending was a little blah circle the supermonsterbomb while it was bombarded by orbital satellites until it exploded not that interesting considering you were riding that monster before it decided to mutatemultiplayer is just boring
the game systems function great against the ai but when playing with other people it again was slow and often a situation of who had the biggest gun or brought a friend
the game played like so many games before it but couldnt pull it off as well
i would rent this game it is not worth owning
keep hold of halo  and wait for recon those have the online gaming thing downjust so you know i have only played this on single player
i dont play online and being a relatively new gamer my only experience with gears  was playing through once with my son when he was visiting recently
that saidthere are some things i love about this game
great graphics rapid reloads mostly interesting game play
unfortunately there is much to hate as well at least for me and those issues make it a lot less fun that it would be otherwise
ive played through it on easy to get a feel for the game and learn the maps and hardcore and am in the middle of insane now useless cutscenes
i like cutscenes that develop a story line but gears  has a lot of short cutscenes that dont do anything but pull you out of the game experience and disrupt continuity
for example in one place youre walking up a ramp onto a ship and halfway up a cutscene kicks it to show you and your team walking up the ramp
very short no dialog and when it ends youre just on the ship but feeling disoriented because you just appeared there instantly the cutscene ends before you actually get on the ship and take your position another cutscene issue is that right in the middle of fighting bad guys a cutscene will start and finish the battle for me
if i wanted to watch characters fight battles without my input id watch a movie
this happens at least three times
very annoying pseudocutscenes
this is what i call action sequences where i control my character but nothing i do has any effect on anything and i just have to let the scene play out before theres any point in doing anything
i timed one of them and it was about  seconds long and you cant skip these like you can cutscenes
you have to let them play out and when they precede a challenging part of the game where i have to go through the same scene over and over until i figure out how to overcome a particular challenge its really annoying after a while several checkpoints are badly placed in my opinion
reach a checkpoint walk here go down stairs walk a while turn some corners walk more hit a cutscene and then the action starts
if i die repeat
too many checkpoints occur right before a bunch of nonchallenging stuff thats just tedious
and there arent enough checkpoints for my tastes
some of the most challenging parts of the game for me are well past a checkpoint and the parts before that arent that challenging
it gets really old having to fight two or three batches of bad guys run here walk there jump barriers turn cranks pick up ammo blah blah blah only to get killed in the same spot over and over until i figure out the trick to survive that section
im actually dealing with one of those sections at the insane level now weapons disappear quickly or just arent there
in some parts of the game i can kill some bad guys and when i move to where they were their weapons are gone so i cant get their ammo
if i move past weapons and try to go back a minute later to get ammo theyll probably be gone
sometimes i hit a checkpoint when there are weapons on the ground
ill get their ammo or swap weapons but if i die when i come back to the checkpoint the weapons arent there
in one case i had a mulcher at a checkpoint but after i died and came back to that checkpoint i didnt have the mulcher
when i come back to a checkpoint the state of the game should be exactly as it was before my ai teammates do too much sometimes and not enough at others
there are battles even at the insane level where if i just hang back my teammates will kill most of the enemy so if i take some time to look for ammo or collectables for example by the time i join the action there may not be much action left too linear
im a big fan of halo  and one of the things i love about it is that there are almost always several completely different ways to accomplish something
you can runandgun or you can snipe
go on foot or in a vehicle
get in and out of vehicles as you wish
drive ride or run the turret in a warthog
i might drive a wraith for most of an objective one time and not use one at all another time
this adds tremendously to the replayability in singleplayer mode
gears  has virtually none of that
theres a little of it but not much
theres a section where youre in a centaur
you drive a path and shoot bad guys
if youre a decent shot its boring and it seems like an unimaginative way to stretch out the game
at least in halo  i can add a bit of variety when i drive a scorpion by giving riders interesting weapons so they can help and i can stop get out pick up ammo and so on
in this i just drive and shoot until i get to a cutscene and im out of the centauranother time im riding a reaver and shooting something behind me
shoot here shoot there no real variation or other options just a test to see how well i can shoot something thats moving wildly around the screen with a turretfor a long time
now that i think about it shoot rapidly moving targets sometimes while im moving too seems to be a relatively common task in this game big holes in the story line
you spend an entire level exploring an abandoned research facility formerly run by humans
vague hints at who ran it and its purpose are given by  the ai security system but mostly it just raises questions that are never answered
something else happens later in the game that raises questions that arent answered
the obvious assumption is that there will be a gears  that answers those questions bugs
i just downloaded an update so maybe the bugs ive encountered were addressed but i was transported several feet and couldnt move a couple of times in one section and i just had to go back to the last checkpoint to recover
there are places where i have to walk off a ledge but if i dont position myself exactly right i just stop and dont go off the edgei know these may seem like quibbles to more experienced gamers but for me the overall effect is to make the game much more frustrating than i think it should be
give me maximum control over my character
let me do my own fighting
let me do my own walking
dont make me repeat tedious sequences of actions when i die and come back to a checkpointoverall its a very cool game if youre playing it once and are good enough that you dont die much
in that case you wont encounter the issues ive listed for the most part
youll want to watch all the cutscenes and pseudocutscenes to get the full story and you probably wont die and get sent back to checkpoints enough to get really frustrated by some of the issues related to them
thats my sons situation
hes an experience gamer who has played gears  a lot and he likes playing online
so hes played this on hardcore with some friends in coop mode
i dont think he ever played through it as a single player and not on insanei bought this used and ive enjoyed it but once i finish it on insane ill probably sell it
definitely not something id play multiple times at the same difficulty leveli had such high hopes for this game particularly given the glowing reviews
yet this game offered absolutely nothing newthe campaign play was incredibly dull and linear and most players could complete it in a day of gaming
not even a long day at that
the storyline is somewhat lame even for a video game
they attempted to spice things up by having more vehicular scenarios but these really were not that exciting eitherexcept for the ability to pick up an opponent off the ground and use him as a shield there is no neat new functions or behaviors
there are a couple of new weapons but again nothing exciting a new pistol a new type of grenade and a flamethroweronline play was incredibly disappointing
the only plus is that there are more types of scenarios than there used to be but that again is the only positive
the maps are tiny not allowing for much room to maneuver
joining a game can take forever
i was sometimes sitting there for five minutes while whatever algorithms epic came up with tried to find a party and then a set of matching opponents
once i eventually got in the games were incredibly sensitive to any player that had a weak connection to the point is screwed up gameplay for everyone elseepic could have saved everyone time money and dashed hopes by simply releasing a mappack for the first game for a sixth of the price of gow  and it would have provided the same amount of enjoymentthe lag on multiplayer modes makes this one very frustrating game to play
if you enjoy being downed by one shot while you pump round after round into the enemy without any obvious effect then this is the game for you
oh and get used to the pre match lobby youre going to be spending a lot of time there as the game goes through the long and tedious match making process
looking forward to gears  just for the pleasure of not buying itthe old adage comes to mind if it isnt broke do not fix itwell instead of epic just fine tuning the multiplay from gow they instead took the whole lobby systemshotgun system and play mechanics and trashed italso their are serious lag issues here that in itself make the game a jokeunplayable again and againfirst off they had a great lobby system in gow why did they alter it into this abominationyour now waiting around for sometimes  minutesyes ten minutes and on a board where your guessing which game your in and who your playingits a crapshoot 
if you want to play ranked warzone well your out of luck hereepic really dropped the ball hereplus you can no longer just drop in unranked matches
the game from this perspective just go and play has been ruined i must say
the lag has you glitching all over the board  and you just want to drop out but even this you cant do you must shut down your xboxthan go wait ten minuites to get into a game you have no idea what type or area it will be ingow was great epic could have just revamped and upgraded the maps  as they did and they look really great i have to say fine tuned the playersas they did again added some great weapons as they did to some extentthe balance here is a bot off and the game would have been awesome
the shotgun makes an odd pop  noise here unlike gears  where it was authenticplus you cant shoot and run very little shotgun battles nowsome like that but really if you take out all the parts that made go great than you are changing a great game not making it betterthe chainsaw duels if the other failings of this game werent so great too would in itself almost ruin gamegone are gears  sneak ups with the shotgun and now its a free for all of shotgun attacks very lame and boring and takes the skill factor to about 
and the duel chainsaw attacks pressing b like crazy is a joke toolike playing ateroids from the sjust smash the buttonsno skill no fun just crazyall in all the game has taken all that was good about gears  out of the gamemade it absolutely stunning to look at added lag that is so frequent you drop out of games on rountine just due to thathas a horrible menu that you cant just jump in any more and play and you have no clue what you will be playingtaking the shotgun and chainsaw elements out of the gears type gameplay is a real shame too as now its like your not even playing gears of war but a whole new gameif they wanted to make a whole new game than they should have by why did they ruin this one
the horde mode is fun but again severe laghorrible menu and lobby system tooif epic doesnt at least fix the lag and flickering issues this game will never be played like the last one
i guess people will get used to the altered weapons but the lobby system i doubt it thats a  disasterjust go play and you here ten people complaining about frameratelagweapons and the horrible lobby systemtheir were never complaints about this while playing gears  but now their is says alot when you get ten people in room all complaing dropping out due to lag tooi give the game a c in its persent form if lag is fixed and lobby system where you can pick a game and get in it relatively quick like gears  than i would upgrade to a bthe other issues are just too much to overcome to give it a better scoreas many have already said this game is a great game but it is almost entirely a complete copy of gears of war with new storyvery little just as in part one and new levels
if you played gears one then you played this gamedo you all remember the big stink that was made over halo  because it did nothing to expand the first game in the franchise
well i think were there again with this game
thats not to say its not a great game but a sequel generally includes expanded and newer features
there is almost nothing new here
you still romp around with your teammates ducking behind barriers taking potshots at baddies tossing the eventual nade and taking down a huge boss at some point in the affair
the one major thing they changed is the lack of real bosslike enemies in the first game
this game adds a few more enemies that rival the size of an apartment building but beyond that i cant think of anything more of value to make this gears of war 
as far as the story as concerned its hardly worthwhile
gow story was just your usual end of the world fair and this game is simply the linear continuation of the last chapter in the first one
they easily could have made this the last  chapters in gow instead of making you pay  more for itif you loved the first game then you will undoubtably fall all over this one
i know i did way back when
years later now after having played the sequel and replaying the first one a few times i think my initial reaction was a little exagerated
id easily give the first game  stars but this one hardly deserves that
it was supposed to expand the series not keep it in limbomy main gripe about this game is its notorious tendency to cause an open tray error on an xbox   i had never heard of or run across this issue until i bought and returned several copies of this game thinking they were defective
it got so bad i had to physically dismantle my machine and adjust the lasers inside and several other games have gone wonky on me i blame it all on this title i swear it has to be cursed
ontop of that this game was actually a dissapointment even once i was able to play it
the story makes almost no sense not that the first was that great but it just doesnt have any depth or a proper flow and while everywhere ive seen says this one and the third are the same length and both longer than the first this one felt the shortest of all and it didnt offer much if any fresh gameplay just more of what the first had only two or three new weapons a short brumak ride
just a bit sprinkled here and there ontop of what was offered in gears   thinking back to all the hype this series had back in the days it came out fresh i cant understand what all the fuss was about
semidecent shooter with a couple good weapons and a well made cover system
thats about all gears  isthis game seems very unfinished
they have one thing right the grappling hook
its very fun to swing around like spiderman and grab on to everything and fly in the air and all that good stuff
too bad the game fails miserably at everything else
from the dreadlocked brattymouthed cyberdouche main character to the horrid gun system to the boring enemies this game is just plain old not funthe world is set up strangely
you have these big open cityscapes to explore and the exploration would be  times funner if not for the random stupid radiation clouds which kill you pretty quickly and the ridiculous water pools which you cannot escape
why even bother putting an oxygen meter in the game when you cant get out of the water anyway
you fall in water  you die
i think i only grappled myself out once
so half the game is outside in the city but the other half is inside buildings
this is achieved with the most boring repetitive design ever
big square hallways and big square staircases that all look identicali dont understand why they even put an aim function for the guns because all it does is take your field of view from super wide to pretty wide
it serves no purpose especially when you are swinging around on a grappling hook most of the time anyway
no way you can aim and shoot
the only success i had with any guns was to grapple an enemy first and shoot down the linebionic commando wouldve been goodifthere werent completely random toxic areas to limit your exploration and to punish you for no apparent reasonyou didnt pretty much die every time you fell into water
seriouslyin some places its maybe a foot deepjust stand up for goodnessake
the controls werent so completely unforgiving at times when you need them to be accommodatingswinging from floating mine to floating mine was actually nuanced and smooth instead of insanely aggravating because of poor attach detection and doofus swing mechanicsyou didnt have to replay huge chunks of the game over and over again because the save spots were in such stupid and unintuitive placesif the story was little more than truly ignoreworthythe main character was less of a toolshedof course it really wouldve sucked if not forreally great graphicsfun grappling mechanicsdecent combattaking enemies out by throwing cars and debris with your mechanical arm one of the games only saving gracesa couple of cool bosses and some really great larger enemiesi wanted to like this game
i really did
there are some really great moments in it but man it was hard to get through with all of the frustration
a poorly designed game with deeply flawed controls a good experience does not make
play something fun insteadi bought bionic commando with the knowledge that it was not the best game
i had heard that some people had fun with it and that maybe the critics had been too harsh
i can safely say that this game earns every harsh word that comes its way
not because it is a flat out bad game but because what should have been a truly fun game seems to go out of its way to be the exact oppositefirst the good points
the graphics are down right beautiful
using your bionic arm is super fun once you get the hang of it
it is fun to swingwow
that was short
now for the bad
those beautiful graphics that i mentioned only show ugly delapidated buildings
your arm is limited throughout the first part of the game
you are shown how to do everything at the beginning of the game but for reasons that are never explained you arent allowed to use your attacks until your never present commander reminds you how they work
suckwhile swinging is fun you are only allowed to swing in certain places
even though the levels look huge most of them are covered in nearly invisible radiation that kills you almost instantly
you wont know where these places are until you swing right into them and die
super suckthe achivements are time consuming given how sporadicly the enemies are sprinkled throughout the levels so you have two options
try and have fun or get the achievements
there is no in betweenwater is another near instant kill
good luck finding something to latch on to in the  seconds youre given before you drownthe snipers in this game can hit you from anywhere in the level
tres unfairit seems like the developers of this game made two different versions
the first is a game with huge levels that you can use your super cool arm to zip around in while killing your enemies with style
the second game was put over the first one and its only purpose it to limit how much fun you can have at any one time
having fun swinging
here take some invisible radiation that you cant avoid
you like the bionic arms combat functions
well then for the enemies that the style of combat would be affective against were not going to let you use any of the cool moves
when can you use them
when the snipers who can see from anywhere come into play and your melee options become pretty much zero seems like a good idea to usin short as well made as this game is it goes out of its way to kill any fun that you could have had with it
if you want something like it but fun buy just cause  play now thank me laterjust cause after working through an arduous verification routine and dealing with customer support i was able to get the game to work
i played the games for several hours hoping that i would experience the same fun that other reviewers expressed but it is just oknothing groundbreaking here
it is basically the same game as the first starcraft with better graphics
in some ways that is a good thing but they could have done so much more
it ended up being repetitive and boring and i soon lost interestwell be seeing this game in the bargain binnovember  addendumthe game is fun overall
multiplayer is a fun experience even despite the repetitive nature of it
i had previously complained that the game was so unbalanced they had to remove dozens of units from the multiplayer experience
even with them out multiplayer is still grossly unbalanced
units like the thor and the void ray are ridiculously overpowered compared to virtually every other unit and they have no real counter the zerg have no counter for themhydralisks are inexplicably weak against void rays mutalisks are killed far too easily and thors have a hidden splash attack with their antiair missiles which does double damage to light units ie mutalisks
this attack is to void rays and mutalisks what fire is to rice paperthere is no unit balance as starcraft had its become an arms race first person to spam thors or void rays wins
and to think the biggest worry i had upon seeing screenshots early on was that the buildings and units looked so bloated fat and cartoony
in fact they do seem rather bloated and cartoony compared to their starcraft counterparts but its not nearly as horrendous as id initially thought it out to beto get the easy stuff out of the way if you care not for the story and only for the gameplay then  stars out of  is a fair ratingi dont know why starcraft was so innovative a game as it was
it simply looked different smooth and was extremely wellbalanced
it was a slick game with easily identifiable units on the field with easily identifiable sounds weapons and controls and interface
it was an innovation and improvement over the engine used in warcraft iihere there is none
they claimed to have completely remade the engine from scratch but you could copy and paste the ui onto command  conquer  or command  conquer  and it would look pretty much the same
its not at all a bad thing but its not really a good thing either if youre looking to play this as a new game
it essentially feels like cc with cartoonier unitsthe game mechanics that went into making starcraft so incredibly balanced will have to be rediscovered here as new units are frequent in coming old units have stats changed and units like the medic become essential for infantry squads as they autoheal when you move or attackmove them with a group rather than wandering out up into an enemy because youd need to micromanage them directlyinitially id have considered the protoss terribly horribly atrociously overpowered due to weapons like the colossus and the void ray but later missions showed that there was more to come for zerg and terran to even the odds
this however says very very little for traditional defensive units like the photon cannon bunkers and units like the zealot
you may as well not even make them anymore unless you plan on massing them in gargantuan numbers as they contribute next to nothing within huge armies whereas in starcraft the melee abilities of a zealot made it essential under a defilers swarm ability or for fast attacksbut the absolute bane of this entry of the franchise is undoubtedly the writingvirtually everything jim raynor or tychus findlay or matt horner says can be found in one line or another from any other movie tv show or video game
theres almost nothing anyone says that isnt cliche stupid poorly delivered or so bland and generic you can skip it and miss out on nothingremember arcturus mengsk
remember mengsk of korhal and how the confederacy nuked korhal into an uninhabitable wasteland
remember how mengsk fought and bled and suffered to fight them with his rebel group the sons of korhal
he was a character so morally ambiguous that he would suffer in order to help civilians and then out of utter rage and vengeance use psi emitters to obliterate entire confederate planets drawing billions of zerg onto antigua prime and tarsonishe wanted to and successfully did end the war and end the confederacy and not end up spending decades fighting hard guerrilla war with the confederate remnants
he mad a bad decision it was the wrong one but he made it and he was going to live with it
he was like joseph stalin in his ceaseless aggression to power and to the safety and security of all terransthe arcturus mengsk in starcraft  is better compared with mahmoud ahmadinejad
he and his administration create laws so blatantly false and outrageous even children would not fall for it
and this is presented constantly in the form of unn broadcasts featuring an obvious parody of news pundits
one mission sees you raynors rebels liberate a civilian area from the zerg and dominion forces
this is then reported on the news where a field reporter reports to the unn pundit
he then asks about civilian casualties and the reporter says actually the only civilian casualties thus far have been crossfire from overzealous dominion forces and as soon as she finishes they panickedly go back to the pundit who panickedly remarks uh well there you have it ladies and gentlemen jim raynor killing innocent women and children
the actions of arcturus mengsk having civilians rounded up and slaughtered or encouraging neighbors to spy on one another or abandoning half his dominion  at the first sign of zerg threat so as to protect his core worlds is so completely out of character for the starcraft mengsk that its a farce
its buffoonery and its made less funny if youve played the terran campaign in starcraft but the absolute worst has to be zeratul and the protossin starcraft the protoss were the big tough fanatical race
they were loyal courageous religious and xenophobic
they had highly advanced technology but otherwise were very much like the terrans in terms of being wellrounded with good people and bad people making good decisions and bad decisionsin starcraft  you could replace them with night elves in world of warcraft or any random race of wizards or magicians from any medieval fantasy work involving people speaking with stunted syllables about ancient prophecies and fallen ones and doomtvtropes has something called flanderization named for ned flanders in the simpsons who believe it or not was once a normal character who was religious but also did naughty things and drank beer and such
flanderization refers to taking one character trait of an otherwise normal character and making that trait the defining characteristic of it to the exclusion of all elsethis has happened big time with the protoss where religious fanaticism and mysticism has now become the defining trait of the protoss
nothing zeratul or nibbler as i call him because hes voiced by the same actor says is not painful to listen to straight out of every lord of the rings knockoff good or bad and done worsemild spoilers abound here  for whatever reason whereas raynor and the terrans are written at a third grade level of vocabulary and storytelling zeratul is written at a kindergarten level
it becomes teethgnashingly irritating to have a cutscene show you where to go and to have zeratul slowly exclaim i must go over there and link with that thing but there are zerg in the way
they may be problematic or a mission where zerg attack your base every three minutes and when theres thirty seconds left zeratul always says the zerg are massing for an attack
to arms
zeratuls fight with kerrigan is not so much a fight as a world of warcraftlooking cutscene featuring an exchange of magic pixie powersi mean psionic energyand then comes zeratuls first crowning moment of stupidity because theres at least two that comes as such a smack in the face to starcraft fans it becomes less the fault of the character and more the fault of bad writing
zeratul encounters a protosszerg hybrid and then states in that stilted bland and monotonous delivery who could have created such a thing
did no one on the writing staff even read the scripts of the first game not even needing to play itso while youre saying duran again and again and again the next mission comes and heres zeratuls stupidity that is again the fault of bad writing not because of total ignorance of the first game but out of just bad writingzeratul encounters the ghost of an old friend
the first thing this old friend says is i have come to you from beyond this world and the first thing zeratul says is but you died
the idiocy then continues as this old friend tells the story of the overmind and its true purpose and zeratul chimes in pointless commentary that only shows how utterly stupid he is not able to use age as an excuse to not understand the concept of lies and ulterior motives and not everything is as it seems
the old friend remarks something about the overmind and zeratul says duh duh but the overmind was a monstrosity
and this old friend has to chide zeratul like a child that it only seemed this way to himi remark on world of warcraft and magical fantasy a lot in this review
know that i am not trashing on the genre or on world of warcraft
it is likely a fine game but my point is that it is an entirely different genre game from this
the same way you wouldnt want to see rubberforehead aliens in battlestar galactica or slapstick comedy in schindlers list i dont want to see magical fantasytype superstition and talks of prophecy chosen one fallen one the damned doom and such in a hard science fiction gamein fact starcraft  does seem at times like that one disastrous step that warcraft  did with the series turning it from lowfantasy into highfantasy which actually went on to greater things in acquiring a whole new fanbase with world of warcraftit doesnt fit on starcraft   and seeing the starcraft series go from something dark ambiguous and hard to something literally at gradeschool level in its simplicity is like watching a childhood hero succumb to drugs or alcoholthis game has a solid campaign that is a lot of fun
blizzard mixes things up to provide achievements story personality and decent graphics
it feels like a solid game playing it
my biggest issue is that i beat the entire campaign before i was done making changes to the options screen
personally i am not big into the multiplayer function
my enjoyment comes from the story and playing the campaign
it feels like i payed for an entire function of a battle net that wont use to often anywaysif you like multiplayer and playing short campaigns you will love this game
then if your like me you will be disappointed by how short the campaign is then be expected to shell out  on the next  campaigns
personally feels like a rip off with the game box barely moving from when i opened it  days agoi might add i only played a couple hours on a sunday tuesday thursday and beat it on friday
didnt even get a chance to play it the following saturday today because im not interested in multiplayergameplay is average but what really brings its score down is written belowgreedinesswouldnt you know it thanks to their succes with wow blizzard has found a new and insulting way to turn all of their games into more money  charging  higher per game and breaking it up into  separate purchases  thus forcing their fans to buy  more expansions if they want a complete game
and thats not even mentioning if you want additional maps and premium content if so then yes more money please
apparently nothing is free with blizzard when they believe they can charge you for itincompleteno chat channels no private lobbies no cross region play poor custom game options and plenty of glitches such as revalidating the same game copy over and over and over and over ughlack of offline playingapparently blizzard in their socialistic approach to control everything about their games forces you to play only online
yes that means no lan
and if you were excited to play while traveling without internet connection forget it the great blizzard of oz has spoken
as you must play via internet
big brother anyoneim no expert butclearly blizzard has been ruined by their own successes and corporate greediness
i hope there is at least one decent person within blizzard who is now saying i told you so
so on behalf of all fans everywhere i would like to formally thank blizzard for charging us  for a partial game that will never technically be oursi havent waited all this time for an incomplete game that is so restricted and controlled
this is not like blizzard
blizzard is supposed to be the thoughtful good company that knows what we the gamers wantno lan ability is unacceptableno spawn installs makes me feel sadsplitting the game into  parts and likely charging  for each is pretty ridiculousongoing online activation could get annoyingthis hardly seems like starcraft or blizzard
what happenedcons  short campaign unimpressive visuals balance issues no lan match making takes too longpros  entertaining while the campaign lasted a few hidden quests were fun to pick up on runs great on older hardwareworth playing once its hurts the  markmy brother bought this game and thought it was great
i saw youtube gameplay videos for this game and i thought it was great
i usually play games that have a good story but the single player campaign requires you to have internet connection and your own key
unlike the first starcraft where you make a profile to do you own missions
this one you have to buy your own profile
if youre the type thats into all the videos and story
you wont be able to because you have to purchase a key so you can have your own profile
what a load of crap only reason why i didnt rate it a one is because it does have a good story and has a lot of potential
otherwise ill just end with the story ending at starcraft where the bitch of the universe beats the protoss and terrans off her platformpurchased the game
spent several hours now playing it how does someone that owns it rate itprosstarcraft  its starcraft 
blizzard product its a blizzard product
cinematics are kind of cool see more in cons sectionreally i did like the game a bit but i cant think of anything else mostly because of the crap i had to deal with while playingconsasks for firewall hole so it can register with blizzard which im fine with
i double checked my settings and it didnt open just  it opened   three of which arent even blizzard but are activision game monitoring software
i disabled all of them
the game still runs and talks to the servers to make sure i have a legal copy annoying
no lan which means i always have to be online to register it constantly and i must be online to play multiplayer
i have mb connections and apparently this isnt broadband according to blizzard and the game lags horribly and i get connection lost because of latencyachivements tips helpscreens unlocked features keep popping up even though i have them turned off some of which fill the whole screen and obstruct game play for several seconds and dont pause the action while they are blocking the viewcinematics arent rendered very well the polygons are clearly visible in many places glasses skin edges of everything round objects have hard sharp edges that randomly appear and disapear the voice overs drone out into the background noises making them hard to hear
even on ultra settings the cinematics and game look blocky and fakegame graphics ive seen better lots better on games several years old
this looks like im playing cc or   way to cartoonydialogue im tired of hearing the marines curse at me everytime i click themmusic is lame i have to agree with most other people while its been upgraded for starcraft  it also doesnt give you the same feel for the situation that starcraft  did
i dont like listening to peppy music while im supposedly on the ropes dying and barely hanging on
i miss the metal music of the terrans this disco country stuff is terriblethe game isnt balanced  units die to fast and buildings die just a tiny bit to fast future patches might fix thisprice way to expensive for to small a game that wasnt polished or finishedconclusioni love starcraft starcraft  is probably a decent followup but its about  years to late considering what they gave me for 
ive seen better
will i continue to play it
yes but only because now i own a middle of the road game
i dont appriciate the firewall holes and the constant internet required
i dont mind not having lan but id like to have it
graphics are weak overall but i could live with that on an older game
i think the product needs to specify how fast an internet connection is required because broadband connection required doesnt help when i would consider a mb or faster link broadband and my isp agrees with meif i could do it all over again would i
yes but only after waiting for the next two installments to come out and lower the overall cost of the game
it isnt worth  for the middle of the road game they releasedi have played this  the first two levels  on a friends machine and it pure terms of graphics and gameplay is spot on  a worthy heir for sc i i feel however is a stunted game in terms of content and abilities and hugely overpriced
it is an insulting triple dipping the like of such the  pc gaming world has never seeni will not buy this gamei have rated games on amazon good or bad in the past and while it makes you feel good  and it gives the media pundits something to ponder on and write about   it has little or no influence in the real world especially on the brass in the targeted companies  because   guess what whiners or not   of those putting ratings out have actually bought the game and the rating will do very little to dissuade the mass of gamers from buying the game
yes we will abuse the game online but we have to buy it to justifiably be able to do it  no
warhammer ii assassins creed ii  prince of persia empiretotal war  they all got bad amazon rating due to draconic drm and still had huge salesfew  like me  will have the strength not buy it much as ive waited for it  realizing this is the only way to attract attention and force the matter on the idiots in chargedont buy the game  send a message to activision you do not like being taken for a fool they can fleece to fatten their bottom lineit all looks real impressive but as far as being a game goes i find this to be far to involved and the real kicker is that there are no printed instucs as to how to play the game
they do give you a notepad though i guess its for taking notes after you have figured out how to play the game reading numerous on line pages
which reminds me if you want to play this game offline you are out of luck
dont get me wrong im not suggesting that we go back to the days of pacman but this game is simply too involved to not even have a printed instruction manual
of course there are the on line instructions but even they leave a lot to be desired
this game might have impressive graphics but as far as playability goes i think one can do a lot better
and play offline too hours for 
thats hardly what id call a large game its a high quality game for sure but definitely not a large game so  for length and  for no lan and  for no international multiplayerthe new battlenet is not a feature or bonus its them grabbing more control over youre gaming experience and killing lan to boot i dont like that it is mandatorymultiplayer is also a toss up most wont ever touch it and if they do they will probably just get killed over and over again starcraft multiplayer is a brutal monstrous thingthe game is very very good but they had the opportunity to make something truly wondrous and spectacular i mean theyve been in development for what  years
this is the best they could accomplish in  years
wow took all the best food for itself leaving nothing but scraps for sc its no wonder it ended up a bit malnourished and anemic so  more for being mediocre when it should have been phenomenalwell thats one star left in my reviewoh and the voice acting for the scientist chick was terriblespoiler theres a scientist chick
i cringed every time i had to talk to hernote i update my rating from  to   in the end i had to get my fix so i bought it
what other choice did i have
i figured i should reflect that somehowlots of bad requires high speed internet to play even if you only want to play single player dialup and you get lag and noserver problems
this may be overstated
recent posts in other places have suggested that it is possible to play without highspeed internet single player campaign is only about eight or nine hours long need to spend  over the comming years to get the entire package cause wings of liberty is only terran games emphasis has been changed dramatically
i was a beta player
it changes the game particularly for the casual player such that unless you are a true expert playing a true expert your game will be fast with mostly low level units unlike the two hour games we used to have
every game with only rare exceptions is a rush over in less than twenty minutes
it is not clear how long it will take if ever for blizzard to fix this
they may not even see this as a problem that needs fixing
maybe it isnt a problem
maybe this is what most people want but i dont
i want a game that can offer me both short and long play
it is no doubt that there are several good replays online and they show very intersting play but this is only the highest level of playbut you know what i could have excused all of this
i got high speed internet and the strength of the game is supposed to be in its multiplayer aspect and given my love of the game i am actually willing to put out the  over the next three years to support blizzard in making more and better games and i am staying positive that my skill would increase as i play and that blizzard will in fact make many balancing changes to address the playability of the game to eventually promote longer gamesbut i cannot excuse the lack of lan play
the biggest and best part of this game was its lan play
i cant count the number of times i drove one two even three hours across four states to various friends houses to spend the weekend eating pizza and grinders and dill pickles drinking beer and beating the crap out of my pals zealots
nothing like a  hour starcraft fest with your friends who have no lifein starcraft you can kiss all that goodbye
there is no lan play
you can only play if you connect to the internet which means immediate limits on bandwidthno longer will i be able to make wise cracks at kerrys stupid sacrifice of his templars while he is sitting next to me only to be pwned by him five minutes later when i find out it was actually part of a real strategy he had been hatching damn he stole my science vessal
what did he want that for
what was the bet again
oh yeah i have to buy the pizza tonight
fourty dollars
what toppings did you guys put on these thingsno longer can i roll over kerrys girl friend with my massive ground units showing once again that it is still possible to win by brute force alone cause if i cant beat kerry i might as well shame his girl friend
  why is she in kerrys natural expansion
what did she just say
oh crap
more pwning
sorry joe you are on  your own now
you guys keep going ill hit the packy but i am not getting bud i hate bud it gives me a headache
what
she wants whaaat
a merlot
mannnah but as monday morning daylight peeks through the shades a new game begins and this time i have a plan
nuclear launch detected
look at them all run around trying to find my ghost hehehe
now for the big finish nuknuknuk lear laulaulaunch dddetectededed
yeah baby thats right feel the wrath of my ghosts
say good bye to your nexuses lairs and command centers
none of them can withstand my multinuke stikes
yes we win
vindication for joe and me
but did they let us win
hmmm we will have to wait three weeks to find out gotta get home
hope the wife isnt still pissed cause we are hosting next time
too bad she aint a playerbut no more
lament that loss of lan parties
the pizza and beer does not taste the same when you cant share itstarcraft was a social game where friends spent their vacations playing it together in each others company
but you have taken that away from us
shame on you blizzard and activision
you have taken starcraft the way of all big businesses and destroyed those pieces of your product that mad it great because you could not help but try to squeeze a few more pennies out of it
there was no need
starcraft was destined to be the biggest game release ever
so why did you choose to do this to usin the end star craft  is a telling product
it shows the direction of the industry in several respects
the industry has awakend to understand that the average computer game player is not a kid and never was but rather is a  year old geek
they expect these adults to have money to spend and they want it
to that end the industry is taking steps to eliminate those aspects of the sales process that they believe inhibit their ability to make money
that means stopping game resale game swaps and game gifting
in short killing the used game market
after all no game developer promoter or original distributor makes money on a resaletradegifting transaction
we will see more of this in the comming years
it will manifest itself as  limited installs no disconnected game play need to register a key which cannot be unregistered or transfered multivendor game hosting services region restrictions often called lockdown and paytoplay instead of the traditional buyandplay 
it means the eventual end of our ability to transfer rights to play a game such that once you install it only you can play it using an account somewhere
the industry expects this to translate into more sales for them
indeed we have seen many games andor vendors already implement at least one of these in the last three years
i feel a backlash however
i for one have only so much money for spending on games and it does not include money for a monthly fee and any changes to gaming as a whole that restrict of otherwise make the social aspects of gaming harder to enjoy will reduce my desire to play computer games in favor of some other form of entertainment
the direction the industry is heading in does not favor the game player
it makes me sadhail flaviusstarcraft ii  wings of liberty
or as i would like to refer to it as suckcraft rd a new beginningblizzard turned  into steamthey limit map size f u to any map makerthe campaign was shallowthe voice acting was badthe story was forced and full of holesits actually more fun to talk about the campaign on sc forums then to play itthis is probably one of the most disappointing games to come out in a long time
you can see from all the reviews the problems this game has
avoid until blizzard does the right thinganyone else doing the same
when diablo  comes out starcraft  will be dead to mediablo  come soon and save us allstarcraft  has been out for a few months now and im bored out of my mind playing it melee and custom
i remember playing starcraft  and how i was totally addicted to everything
i spent most of my high school youth sad as that sounds playing this and diablo
im in custom games for sc and the only thing i can really find are a bunch of tower defense or mass spawning games like nexus wars there are tons of similar games as well
ive been waiting forever for firebat tag or some sort of fun tag game and im guessing no one is going to come up with one till maybe a year or two from now
i also thought that maybe this feeling was just me but the proof is also in my friends list
i have over  people in my friends list and when this game started and a month or two in  of them were on a lot
a month or so of not playing and i come back and now i only have  people on which has been so for almost two weeks nowso ive sort of given up on starcraft  maybe another year or two and hopefully they will fix the following below and there will be a lot better custom games available
overall sc died because it was overhyped over a dozen years in the making and its practically the same in many areas and worse where it counts
i was expecting a lot more
im sad that blizzard a company that usually has a great reputation for making highly successful games have failed on one of my favorite types of mmoslets all hope they dont murder diablo  as welli have pretty much the same complaints as the majority including some of my own personal feuds with it
cant change usernames  you can change it now but it took months and should have been something available at the very beginning
they should have also said in clear oversized fonts that the name chosen would be your final
now you can change it once for free but pay for it afterwards
thanks blizzardi was basically running around for a few months now with the lame username of zerg
i made it because i thought id get a rare original name and that i could make multiple usernames
fortunately for me though some people still think theres such a thing as an original name so i get to gloat once in awhile
yeah i have the rarest name in the world envy meeeee
no original names  so if you have a name a ton of other people have it
not to mention you cant even add numbers to your names which kills the thought of originality even more
clan tags  still dont see it available
no chatrooms  this is one of the biggest issues to me because other than playing games i would also use it to socialize with my gaming friends
chatrooms and private chatrooms help people organize games they want to play with each other and so on
personalize game names and party and invite system  before in sc you can tell your friends the game name you wanted and they can copy and paste it into the search and be in there
now you got to party up or invite one by one
i dont like to party up because if one person doesnt accept the game you want you sort of have to wait and im not sure if they fixed this yet but if you go into a game that has separate teams like a vvv kind of game like a custom game you cant really join because being in the same party the party system only works for games thatll let you be on the same team i understand the use of the new organization system but i would like the option to revert to customized game names as well backstabbing is now replaced by a custom game called phantom which i find is nowhere as fun
backstabbing should be left as it was in the first one because it gives the feeling of real battle where theres more randomness and unpredictability
in phantom you already know theres a backstabber
i dont want that i just want it the way it was where you play a game like computer stomping or even just melee and thinking everything is great and then it happens
i dont really like how you cant run between stuff like pylons with my probe
this is a personal thing but i like being able to run between certain closely built buildings its very useful for custom tag games
profile icons look like crap
they look neat blown up but when people join games it looks like trash
like one person would have this icon that i really thought was barf
most of them look too small and the details so hard to see that earning them seems not so much of a reward
i play on a  lcd monitor by the way so i would say im the majority or a little overif you love the original you will probably love this oneif you hated the original you will probably hate this oneno need to go over the same things everyone else has other than to say they did a nice job on updating the game but nothing new was really added to single player mode more cinematic story and such the single player experience is basically a training exercise for the battlenet online gamesso if you are interested in single player game there are better games than this
if you are looking to do lots and lots of online game then this is a great buymy own experience with on line is that it seems repetitive and not my bagscroll down to see the list of pros and conswell to start out id like to say that im a huge fan of the originalstarcraft
i loved everything about the original graphics sound storyvoiceacting gameplay everything about it was great
the single player wasreally engrossing and a blast to play
i also had tons of fun playing on lanwith my brother against ai opponents
i didnt really want to get starcraft but i decided to check it out for the heck of itdoes starcraft  live up to the original
in a word no
in two
hell no
in noway is starcraft  a worthy sequel
why isnt it
read belowthe graphics in starcraft  arent outright bad but they arent good eithertheyre not very impressive compared to more recent rts games
but thats notthe real problem the problem is that theyre just improved warcraft graphics
they end up being pretty cartoony
starcraft  being rated tfeels cartoony in the same sense that unreal tournament  was cartoony
itjust doesnt feel like a serious game
the cutscenes are good as usual but two of them most people will have seen before and the just arent very epic like blizzard said they would bethe sounds are mediocre at best
in starcraft every unit had a distincteasily distinguishable sound to it
if a zealot was attacking my units i couldtell right away that it was a zealot
the sounds for this game are just weakvoiceacting in starcraft  is godawful
seriously its so bad that it makeswarcraft s voice acting look good
its made even worse by the extremelycheesy dialogue
during singleplayer i was extremely tempted to turn thesound all the way down because it was so bad
at one point i did turn it allthe way down but i ended up doing badly because i couldnt hear what was goingon
i found myself hoping that the entire cast would die off at the end of thesingle player campaignstarcraft s gameplay is full of hard counters there are a lot of units forall three races that can only attack either air or ground units and there areonly one or two for each race that can attack both
the gameplay definitelyisnt what i would call interesting
the units themselves are really boringand some of them are direct ripoffs from other games
theres just nothingthat makes them interesting
the unit pathing has a lot of issues tooone of the things that bugs me the most about the new units is that theoriginal starcraft units could wipe the floor with the new onesmultiplayer is more competitive compared to the original but i think its amatter of taste
personally i didnt like it that much because all it really is is finding that one winning build order and doing it over and over and over again
the new battlenet ismissing integral features like chat channels or a clan system and aside fromthat the game itself is regionlocked
wanna play with friends in europe
toodamn bad
you cant
battlenet was blamed for delaying starcraft considering the delay you would think that it would at least be a lot morepolished than it isthe plot
well blizzard really needs to hire new writers
the plot is full ofborrowed elements from blizzards other games and all in all its just bad
there are tons of holes tooits not original at all
the cliched ending can be seen coming from a mileaway
its a cop out if ive ever seen one
aside from that the presentationfor the hybrids was awfulthe single player experience was fun for the first few maps but it wasnt innovativeor anything and it got old really quickly
playing as jim and not as themagistratecommander made it a lot less interesting
theres a point where youcontrol zeratul and play as the protoss but even those missions were poorlydone
the only character i ever actually liked was tychus findlay who providessome pretty good comic relief
but guess what happens to him at the endif you cant see it coming you need glassesand last but not least theres no lan play
if you want to play with a buddyin the same room you have to do it through battlenet
this can lead to quitea few issues while my brother and i were playing a game together we ended upgetting lag and connection issues even though our computers are relatively newand our internet is pretty fast
lan play wouldve meant no lag but sadly wehad to deal with itpros its dmultiplayer is competitive and fastpaced although it wont appeal toeveryoneraces are fairly balancedcons graphics are mediocre and cartoonybland singleplayer experienceterrible voice actingbattlenet  is clunky and missing plenty of features
lack of lanif you dont like steam or securom you wont like starcraft s drmpoorly written plotstarcraft  just doesnt live up to the name starcraft
its definitely not afive star game or even a four star one
all things considered its fairlymediocre
at least ill get my money back when i sell it
oh wait i cant sell it because the serial key is attached to my account
way to kill the third party market activisionblizzardsome get their panties in a bunch when they talk of this game but how many times are you going to do your x rush in the first few mins of the game until you realize its all the same and boring 
they need an expac for this and fast it just needs more units to liven things up get tired of doing and seeing the same unit rushover and over and over and over againits been a while since i last played this game this is how bad the replay value is for starcraft   i am currently playing diablo  and the reply value is much greater
after finishing the single player story mode for this game i had no motivation to play the online game against others because it just became somewhat boring  i would not recommend this game to my friends because of the price
if you really want to play this game wait for the price to drop it is not worth the premium pricefor those who are not online game players this game is a huge painhad a difficult time getting credit for the full retail version because it would only play the demoit was difficult to get the system to accept the cd key to authorize the full gamemajor pain in the athe original starcraft arguably the greatest realtime strategy game ever made
sure it had a couple of quirks like the guardians pathfinding bug which made them move into close to turrets when they didnt have to but overall you had a perfect balance between the three races and an extraordinary campaign
realistically youre never going to make everybody happy with a sequel because it can never live up to the perfect game that people will be imagining it will be
so when i say that this game is very similar to the original starcraft a lot of ways its not a bad thingi was extremely into starcraft a year or so after broodwars came out
i got it in that big battle chest thing with the two strategy guides include
i spent countless hours playing the game with friends on my own and played the campaign two times through completely
the original had this on mode where you could get other people to try out the game by joining your games and it was a lot of fun
it also lacked copy protection and was pirated mercilessly
as a consequence blizzard has gone  in the wrong direction
the copy protection starcraft two is stifling
it give you an idea let me tell you install process went
remember this is using the disc and not the digital downloadi put in the disc and let the program install the whole  gigs
a nice touch theyve put a bit of back story in the installer so you hear a little bit about that previous game to get you started while its installing
theyre still waiting for quite a while but its a large game who can fault that
it also asked to activate on battlenet
so i log into my web browser and try to go thereand naturally all my old starcraft accounts are now invalid
hooray
so i set up a new account and then go to play my game
but wait the installer has to run and optimization will take between  to  min
this is after the entire install from the disc
so fine i wait for it to do its little thing and then it starts downloading patches conveniently telling me that it has a certain amount time to go before the game is playable but i can play before its fully patched
so apparently to aid in copy protection prevention they dont include the whole game on the disc
so now im waiting even longer until it can download the freaking installer
fortunately you can play before the entire patch has downloaded but still expected to spend more time waitingif youre on an att internet account or anybody else with bandwith caps you need to know this
by default the installer downloads some data via pp
so not only are you downloading the patches as of this writing about  gb youre also losing bandwith as it uploads on your own connection without informing you first
to blizzards credit you can disable that feature from the installers options at the top but i personally felt stolen from because it was done without my consent
ask me first blizzard if youre going to be too cheap to use the bandwith from your own servers
maybe ill be cool with it for speed but not asking isnt rightso i finally get the whole thing downloaded and happy and im prompted to enter my battlenet password and username
it seems i have to enter this every single time i log in
theres no remembering my password so i have to type it every freaking time
not only that the game requires a constant internet connection unless you want a play as a guest
even then youre only allowed to play your own game for  days between activations
this level of copy protection is freaking ridiculous
oh and per their terms they make it very clear that you dont own anything theyre only licensing it to you
again to their credit they have very prominently how you can return the game for a full refund if you do not agreethe game includes only the terran campaign
personally thats my favorite race anyway but it seems like theyre trying to make a cash cow to separate the game at into three separate parts
each game is priced higher than the normal freestanding game but on the other hand theres free online play which you have to factor is built into the price
if youre paying any kind of monthly fee to play online with people you would easily go over the cost of the game so dont find the high initial price all that disturbing
i should note you do have guest passes that apparently let you have other people try the game as sort of a demo but they have to download the  gb full game to do sogameplay is quite similar to the original game but somewhat faster paced
there are naturally more units and everything looks great
the movies in between levels have been improved drastically
everything looks more lifelike and i have no complaints
that said after playing it ive just sort of felt like it was just there
i dont have the same emotional attachment and feeling of excitement i had playing the old game
somehow i doubt ill get around to playing the campaign again
the best way i can describe it is like a sequel to a movie thats technically better in nearly every respect but has all the heros wearing pepsi logos on their outfits and the theater usher is checking your ticket stub every  minuteseven with all the extra stuff i had such good feelings about the original that if this game and come out say year or two before it did i wouldve bought a new computer just to play it
as it was i waited until the game was on sale for about one third its initial cost before even considered buying it and even then it was iffy
blizzard you kind of lost me guys
i find im much happier playing thewarhammer kgames
not nearly so much headache
not planning on buying the next oneupdate with the current patch you cannot play offline
youre stuck with the same always on tether certain other games have
ive read some posts and it may be a glitch but this is intolerable for me
i cant have my connection up constantly
i truly regret purchasing this gameupdate  just fyi battlenet will install itself and its cache on the c drive even if you install the game on another partition
the installation has added a bit over  mb to my primary partition
i wont bore you with details but its somewhat irritating to me because it increases the size my periodic backups need
one reason i tolerate steam is that at least it plays nice where i installed it also its offline mode works
sc offline mode is still broken as of todaystarcraft ii has been a long time coming and i dont mean its comically long development cycle
rather it is the longfeared bastard child of a lengthy line of increasingly invasive and repugnant designer control devices gussied up as antipiracy conventionsgather round wee bairns and ill tell you a tale
once upon a time when if you bought a video game you actually owned it
in this crazy bizarro world ownership of the game cartridge or floppy disk actually enabled you to simply play it whenever wherever and however often you wanted
it was yours like the books on your shelf or the shine in your stillbut then the designers grew wroth
somewhere they assumed someone might not be paying for their game
and so they in their infinite wisdom decided they could take steps that  although mildly intrusive  might cut down on some of the imaginary money diverting away from their coffers
so they invented things like cd keys and watchdog programs and hidden rootkits and phone home programs that would secretly report your nefarious doings back to the mothership whenever you foolishly logged your computer onto the internet or wandered into a wifi area
each antipiracy development was a little more aggressive a little more probing and invasive than the last
but for many gamers as long as they got the particular game they wanted all was well
after all the developers had to come to their senses eventually right
its not like in their eyes all gamers are guilty until proven innocent or anything
rightthen one fateful evening in the early st century an overworked developer accidentally crossed the streams of his mountain dew and red bull and had an epiphany  we dont even need to sell the games at all
we can sell access to the games which we keep safely locked up here on planet jackass
and lo  steam was born requiring you to download and play nice with an entire suite of malicious nannybot programs if you even wanted a fighting chance of playing the games you supposedly purchased when you obtained valves orange boxsteam download kit
quietly privately we all died a little bit more insidestarcraft ii is the next evolutionary step in this process
you do not actually own starcraft ii
you do not even own the present  of starcraft ii that has been opened for public viewing
rather you own  temporarily and subject to unappealable veto  access to starcraft ii provided you maintain a live internet connection invasive battlenet account under your actual name and inherently agree to chisel off any of your former expectations of playing with any of your friends in lan games or spawning games to host with others
no instead you must each buy a starcraft ii gameaccess kit stay connected to battlenet and pray that blizzard decides to not alter the deal any further
if youre very very good maybe youll get to buy the zergs or protoss someday for another  a shotsomething has to give
do we really want to pay another  just to be able to use the barbarian class in diablo iii or subscribe to a month recurring fee just to be able to use flying units in starcraft iii
how many pay gates will we permit developers to place between us and a full unfettered copy of the entire game that we supposedly purchased in the first place
someday developers may realize the basic economic point that selling  million copies of a full game is more profitable than selling  copies of a spyware program masquerading as a space odyssey while simultaneously enraging their own customer base
we can help that happen by not buying into the latter in the first placeblizzard is now my enemy
the great quality of this game is overshadowed by terrible service and battlenet being a shaky platform
as a fan of the original games the hollow support for easy software free lan parties is a constant reminder that the series i once loved is not the series that has reemerged
the gameplay itself is great but the support system that it rests on makes you feel like a captive rather than a participantwell i was one of those fans of the series who has been playing since the release of socom like most people i felt the series fell off after socom most people who enjoyed socom  and ca were new comers who didnt know the difference and so they accepted the later games while the original fans left the series and the community crumbledsocom confrontation was supposed to be the return to greatness the original fans hoped forwe had all been dreaming of a next gen socom to wipe out all the issues we had had on the ps  such as cheating and lagthe developers promised to return to the roots and restore the core gameplay of the earlier games in the seriesthey failed on so many levelsto make matters worse while saving some not so important core elements they changed the most important core elements that were directly related to giving this game the socom feel or atmosphereyoure going to see alot of fanboys who love everything with socom slapped on the cover drooling all over this game and encouraging you to purchase it which is very ill advised as most people arent as easily impressed by just the socom name alonefirst issue is well documentedthe server errorslogging on is a problemconsoles locking up is a problemfreezing while in the middle of a game is a problemthe problems at launch are far worse then the average launch titlefanboys say oh but wait for the patches that can be fixedok so i will tell you know about the gameplay elements themselves that cant be fixed as i am  sure slant  wont make patches for anything other then game errorsfirst off this game was built around ots over the shoulder view and while it has a classic view the contols for classic view are seriously compromised because of the existance of ots as the defaultplus classic view is not quite the same third person view we used to haveits zoomed in closer to your back shows about waist up and doesnt show the whole body even in wide open parts of the map unless you look down at your feetyou now need to use motion controls to lean instead of the easy dpad lean that was much more responsivemotion controls are a gimmick to label it next gen and are never as precise as the simple push of a buttonthe reason dpad controls are gone for classic view is that in night vision you are forced into ots view and need dpad controls to use for the ots perspectiveso yes they didnt exactly tell the truth when they said we would have a true classic view cause its a different third person perspective and ots is still forced on you anytime you go into night visiongone also is first person perspective that you could use to see through windows and bushesafter having that view for urban warfare in past games you will see how sorely missed it is when you have the hampered view trying to shoot people from windowsalso you cant move the camera up that way to see out a bush so you pretty much have to crawl out of the bush and expose alot of your body to seeso much for hiding like a sealthe control set up is far less intuitive then it was beforethe simple quick swap is gone and you must now stop playing and select your new weapon through a weapon wheel menu that hampers the fluidity of gameplaythrowing grenades can be done with a button but to get the furthest range you need to use motion controls and even then your max range is half what it used to beon top of that the kill radius on grenades is non existantits literally like throwing firecrackers at the opponentsfor every  grenades that land and explode right in the enemies lap you are lucky to get one killmost times grenades that blow up right at your feel take away no health at allgone is the old knockdown radius that would knock an opponent down and injure him if he was just out of the killzone but in shrapnel rangeyou either die or you dont no inbetweenthe grenade system feels like it is more primitive then even the first socom on the ps  which was made about  years agonothing next gen about the grenades here it took steps backwards to the  bit era of video gamesthe lobby system is watered down from past gamesthe friends list is very generic no longer showing the room your friend is in or allowing you to join off the friends listthere are people already glitching so gone is the theory that ps  would bring a cheat free experienceonly time will tell if it can be fixed if they make good on promises to start banning people which will probably be on hold while they concentrate on the bugs firstno person in their right mind can say this is the best socom yetif success of this game rides on graphics alone then i can see some people praising this game as the graphics are a definite upgrade from the old socomsas far as all the other elements such as controlsgameplayand the communitylobby features this game is a massive downgrade in every waynew people to the series and graphics fanatics seem to be the only ones claiming this is the best socom evertrue socom fans would never embarass themselves by making such a claimi will say that when you can get into a game its better then socom  and ca but socom  and  overall are still by far the best games in this seriesafter seeing the finished product i wish they had just kept zipper making the game and fired seth luisi as he is the real problem thats hurting the seriesa remake of the old socom  with better hit detection and graphics woudl have been a huge improvement over this gamemany will tell you oh well it needed to evolve and changei can understand that if the changes were taking the game forward but when a next gen system takes the game backwards in gameplaycontrolsand lobby system i hardly see where that is evolvingi think people still praising this game are in severe denial and want to love this game cause its better then to accept that socom has diedafter the newness of the graphics and maps wears off i think they will realize the only real improvements were graphics and sound while everything else is a downgrade compared to socoms  and these are only some of the issues i could go on and on and right a whole book of stupid additions and omissions from this new socomits so lacking that i am literally jaw dropping shocked at how some people claiming to be with the series since day  call this the best socom yetthey had to have forgotten everything that made the old socoms great or are simply to blinded by new pretty graphics to stop and notice everything thats been screwed up severelysave your money and get rfom  when it comes outthe first resistance fall of man had a better server on their very first attempt and sony has gone cheap lackluster servers for  straight socoms nowi played the first rfom to tide me over till socom but after playing it rfom is easily the better online gameuntil we get a next gen socom that truly goes back to its roots rfom is the new king of online play for the ps  and the improvements i have already seen in the sequel coming next month just cement its spot all the moreif you are willing to sacrafice some realism for a fun game with a much smoother server to play with people all over the world the rfom series is best all aroundit took me awhile to adjust to rfom as i loved socom and the real military aspects but the gameplay has just fallen so far off its not the same socom the original players knew and lovedok let me start of by saying i have played dozens of tactical shooters in my life rainbow six  raven shield would have to be the best shooter ive played online  single player
so i understand how they workbut this game just utterly fails as a tacticalshooter from the startinstallationhow you ask
well for one  once you open the game and pop the disc in it automatically starts
so what you say
not when a message tells you you need to quit the game and install it from your xmbwhy would they make a game once you start up you have to quit and install it separately
i mean i dont mind installs but why couldnt they have just made the install while in the game
doesnt make sense if you ask me especially since the install is  gbs long
but thats nothing too bad unless you need conserve space
so after that you need to install the patch which is where the extra gb comes from gb are needed for the gameall in all it took about an hour or so and it was  am when i finished all thatnow comes even more failureserversthe servers would have to be one of the worst
they tried to make the server lobbies like other pc games but the thing is this is ps you cannot mix pc with ps
it takes a while to join a game and at times you cant join a channel  it would tell you that it failed to join and you need to join foreign channels japan etcyou think thats bad
not even closegameplaythe game play is not the worst i have encountered but it is bad
it is it too slow
most tacticalshooters are somewhat what you would call slow but the game play in this is too slow
there are too many button configurations to do one simple thing
aiming is a pain there are  types of zoom but it doesnt work  its pointless
to switch weapons is also annoying you can only switch  weapons onoff with the l button but to switch to grenades or your secondary weapon you have to hold o move with the dpad on what you want and release o while holding the dpad button
what a great concept especially when you run out of out of ammo and switch and your grenades come up instead of your handgun while getting shot at sarcasm  that just takes up too much time
grenade tossing is a joke its like i said slow and the blast is so weak hardly anyone would die with the grenades you throw at themthe reticule is also a disappointment when you start shooting your crosshairs jumps all over the place you cannot really get a steady aim  not even when you are still
and not just that but the rd person view just gets in the waythe camera is too close to your character and when you have your crosshairs to the leftright your guy will get in the way the person you are shooting and cant see where he is at this mostly happens when he is close to you
what a joke
you can also peek leftright by moving the sixaxis but whats the point
it doesnt work with rd person shooters like this
not to mention the response is slow turning around is a pain since most of the time when i die i get shot from behind and to turn around takes forever by the time i do im already dead
not to mention there too many glitches in this game there is lag but nothing too bad just getting in the game sucks
although the game play is bad i ended up getting used to it and it was somewhat fun playing at first then i got disconnected after an hour playing because of servermaintenance  what a crock
then there are the mapsthe maps are too big for the style of the game too little people hiding and too much time is wasted looking for someone
the spawn points are also ridiculous you can easily get spawn raped
not to mention the maps are terribly designed which moves onto the next flawgraphicstexturesok i usually dont care for graphics in a game to me its all about gameplay  story  but since the game play wasnt anywhere near good
i have to look at graphics which arent that great either
in fact socom looks like a beefed up ps game
heck a majority of ps games look much better than this
the texture for the maps were bad looked really crummy and there was so little detail in the gamei dont know what the real resolution of the game was but i was running it in p and the game still looked choppybluetooth headsetyou probably already know the game comes with a bluetooth headset which is awesome at first but somewhat pointless
no one in the game really uses it except clans
i only used it once and that was in another game
but other than that its good to have so you can use on your cell phone  which is exactly how i am going to use mine
the headset is a very sleek design very cool and not bulky or ugly like other headsetsconclusionoverall socom confrontation is not the worst game for ps with its outdated confusing slow gameplay and choppy graphicsit is pretty bad
lets just put it this way ghost recon  for ps was far more worse than thisthe game fails to interest there is nothing new at all
and like i said its bad gameplay would probably make you want turn the game off
the sad thing about this is that this was christmas gift from my brother in which i told him the game was decent the first day i played it and it was true it was decent at first and within a period of  days i have come to dislike the game but not hate iti would probably not pick up and play the game again anytime sooni would not really recommend this game for a friend or as a gift to someone its a game you should rent before thinking of buying it
in the end this game fails as a tacticalshooterthey wanted a pclikegame for the ps but it didnt succeed this is another fail on sonys partthis game has so many little flaws that it makes the experience really annoying sometimesfor example it is impossible to shoot over some railings on buildingsinstead of having the higher ground advantage youre a sitting duck to guys on the groundsounds like nothing rightyoull be pulling your hair out in no time when you discover that it gets worsei love socom  and this shouldve just updated the graphics and added new maps without changing much elsei could go on and on about whats wrong with this game but im sure dozens of guys have full reviews herestill i think this is the most fun you can have with a rd person next gen shooter
i bought my ps for this game and its the only game i play although sometimes i think about defecting to call of dutyi cant wait for mag
zipper i miss you
i love youkissesjwell l bought this game the same day as dead space
l had great expectations for both games and dead space didnt disappoint
as for socom confrontation this is a piece of crap
how could slant  studios produce such a user unfriendly interface
the setup is poorly done and the ranking system is unclear
load times are pathetic and the gameplay itself is unmotivated
i always enjoyed socom for the ps but unfortunately socom confrontation is so buggy and slow that l couldnt enjoy it one bit
to think this was on zerimards top  of fall  is a shame
here is hoping slant  studios does something soonthis game didnt hold my interest
i tried playing for a few days but i got bored very quickly
i thought i would really enjoy this game but unfortunatly i didnt
i like to finish a game once i start but this game was so boring to me i had to stop
the only pro was the graphics
i would not recommend this unless you are under ghostbuster fall down i go pick up ghostbuster
ghostbuster falls down again i go pick up ghostbuster again
ghostbuster fall down i leave him down
if you enjoy a video game version of the medical alert braclet commerical ghostbusters the game is for youbesides the repetitive gameplay you are either shooting ghosts with  of  weapons or shooting ghosts and trapping them the unendurable load times in between deaths  seconds at least and the puzzles that arent brain busters but sometimes take forever because the objects arent rendered well what ive found most irritating is the glitches
ive had to restart several checkpoints because of ingame errors and if you think peter venkman gets irritated with ray sometimes you havent seen me having to replay a  minute ghost shootout when i was deathly bored the first time
there are way too many flaws in this game for anyone to pay actual money for it
ghost money maybe notable examples of errors i enjoyed  i could not leave the kitchen after killing all of the ghosts because the game didnt register it the ghostbusters have to say all clear but never did and in the graveyard a ghost got stuck in a tree on the other side of a wall so i couldnt trap it and therefore could not advance
strange but no gentle reader when something is strange in your neighborhood you dont call the ghostbusters
you call the nearest resell shop and ask how much they are giving for a used copy of this gameand the third example something that actually made me spit  when you get knocked down it will happen quite often that the other ghostbusters if any of them are standing right next to you will run away instead of picking you up
as he returns hes knocked down and you fail the mission
that means you have to watch and listen to the same scene sometimes  times depending on the difficulty level
fun
no
not funwhat id recommend is renting it for a friend and watching them suffer playing it
whenever there is a cut scene ask the victim to call you back in the room so you can watch
youll save yourself money youll safe yourself grief you may lose a friend  so make sure you invite a soso friend
