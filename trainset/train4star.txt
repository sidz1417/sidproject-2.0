roller coaster tycoon loopy landscapes is a great game yet it lacks a few things
first it hasnt added many new rides
also you cant charge admission to the park in the normal scenarios which is where most of the income comes from
on the other hand it does add tons of new shops and stalls and it adds  new scenarios most of them having unique goals such as quothave a monthly ride income of at least quot hence the name loopy landscapes has added six new exciting themes like a winter theme or a creepy theme
loopy landscapes gives three actual parks that you can control
alton towers is one of them
overall i really like loopy landscapes though it does lack a few things
i would recommend this game to anyone who has some roller coaster tycoon experiencethis is a good extension to the roller coaster tycoon game
although it does not explicitly say it will work with windows xp my son has had no trouble running it on our pc which is running windows xp home edition
make sure you install roller coaster tycoon game before you install roller coaster tycoonexpansion pack loopy landscapesi liked how this game had a lot of new extras but i have to admit i liked the first one more
even though this one had a lot of extras it wasnt much different from the first oneinteresting game however the plot of the story while simple i often think of as unfinished
its like there could be more stuff added into plot
anyways great soundtrack too while very retro and kind of simplethis game is a good fps if you like starship troopers or halo but the controls  are very hard at first then they click
the story seems good but is sorta un eventfullgoing through  tunnels to save some  old lady that when you get there is dead but the online play is da bomb the geo mod ius also fun at first then you get tired or all the holes
i like this game and if you like metal of honor and halo get this game
if not get swat to cure your fps hungerthe seller was redpansy
i bought it used for  bucks
graphics look good game play is fun there is a decent story to it the controls are good and sounds are well done
its one of the games i plan to replay in the futurethe latest patch for the game is here is what worked for me running windows xp home sp with directx c installed game installed patch  installed purefactionsetupexe available from purefaction dot org run the pure faction exe instead of the red faction exewhen running pure faction if i run pfexe then the game crashed right away asking for directx 
 if i run pflauncherexe with normal window selected same crash error
 if i run pflauncherexe with either windowed or stretched selected then the game works just fine no directx  error and no video tearingi did not use windows compatibility modevisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionssimply put red faction is a good shooter
its fun the graphics are decent and its funny
its different in that its a game that doesnt take itself too seriously
i often chuckle at the things that happen in the game and the way my enemies will cry for mercy before i blow them up or shoot them
for the price youve got a very good value here
if youre a shooter fan then get a copy of red factionthis game turned out better than i thought it would
a real fun straight forward shooter
the story was easy to follow even though your objectives once given couldnt be seen again
the sound and music was great
the geomod engine in my opinion didnt add that much to the gameon my almost antiquated computer mhzgeforcepeniimb ram i had no trouble with the game at all
it looked greathighly recommended for the fps fanred faction is a pretty standard fps for its time
the story basically involves miners on mars revolting against an oppressive corporation
you play as a rebel working with the red faction the underground resistance intent taking down ultor corporation
while the game is quite dated by todays standards it still serves up a healthy amount of fps fun
my thoughtspros sizable and varied environments
not too linear just enough direction so you still know where you need to go to complete the missions geomod technology the ability to destroy just about any surface in the game is a fun concept and adds depth to an often overdone genre interesting story nice blend of creatures and humanoid opponents some great minimal ambient musiccons limited ammo which can really make it difficult to take advantage of the geomod technology aspects some music is the typical annoying cheesy guitar action rock some overly difficult levelsa solid fps for its time that has held up over time pretty well
definitely worth a play throughi am a big fan of fps games and have nearly all that are available for the pc
red faction has great graphics and fast gameplay
my only complaint is the fact that some of the levels are almost impossible to beat even at the easy level
without the cheat codes i would have never made it through the final few missions
overall i enjoyed the game
i would like to see new mods released for itill make this one simplethe high pointsred faction has lots of action
the weapons are well done   the rail gun can see shapes and shoot folks through walls
there is a lot of constant action and shooting
the game moves around  sometimes you are driving a vehcial  other times you are sneaking around with your weapons holstered in an office environment and sometimes you are running and shooting
there are some fun moments built into the game  not everyone is waiting to shoot you  sometimes guards are taking a pee or have their backs turned which adds some realismthe bad amp uglyif you just want to shoot amp kill red faction is fun but if you like a story with your shooter there are problems
first sometimes you just plain forget what you are trying to do but that doesnt matter because if you find the right button press it and kill the people near it its usually right
there arent a lot of different skins for bad guys so most of the time you are shooting guards or mercenaries that look the same
they also tend to say the same  or  things over and over
the story doesnt always make sense and the scripted acting is godawful
geo mod doesnt make or break the game
yes you can blow chunks out of walls with rockets for fun and sometimes even to your advantage but not everything is able to be blown up so easily
finally the graphics are good but in some places they are blocky or hazy and lack the dramatic sky and martian landscape this game could have had if it put more into its graphic enginethis games graphic is so good
its real funif you have lot of stress from business of yours this game is for youbut one thing i didnt like about was that it was like other gamesin shooting games  you get many bugslike when you play onlinethats why i gave  stars
but stillthe most exciting shooting game ive ever played in my whole entirelifealso i think it works on xp
it works on my xp computerbuy this cool gamethis game as ok gameplayok sound quality but support from supporting ad and eax cardsonly supports directd hardware rendering from your d huge accelerator video cardthe thing that makes this game specialthe terrain
you know how in most fpsfirst person shooterswhen you shoot a rocket a a surface ceiling or wall it just leaves a black huge circular mark and fades after a whilewell guess whatnot in red factionwhen you shoot a rocker on a surface it leaves a hole in ita realistic messed up dirty broken surface rocky hole keep on doing it creat a cave like realistic terrain tunnel further and further and furtherbesides the point terrain digging people this is your gamei reccomend a penitium mhrz mb ram supporting directd accelrator ad or eax directx accelerator sound cardmbram ghz of harddrive space for installation mouse and keyboard high quality supervga up to bit color and a pair of high quality speakersjust get the game terrain diggersyou will love itbut that is not saying much
what i will say is that the game is a lot of fun to play and the graphics are excellent
you have a wide assortment of weapons to frag with from a handheld phaser to a personal photon torpedo launcher
the level designs range in quality from good to spectacular i love the one with the quotinvisible floorquot
i recommend this game to anyone who likes star trek and fps games
elite force is what quotvoyagerquot should be a fun experienceok by far this is the best use of the star trek license
it has come a long way since the first st game came out for the pc
gaming companies tried everything from point and click adventures to real time sims
well looks like raven did their research well and came out with an fps using st license
if youre wondering how the game looks like well there are  sides of the coin with this game
in the single player game the game really doesnt show the full potential of the quake iii engine
i got the feeling that for the single player they used a toned down version of the q engine
however when you get to the multiplayer called holomatch as paramount does not want to promote online violence games so they used the world holomatch instead of deathmatch this is where the q engine finally kicks in
so lets split this review into two parts single and multiplayer
single player really the story is just your average alien incursion into your damaged ship
the story though very generic still is carried along because of the action that it involves to push the story on
multiplayer ok multiplayer here rocks
most of the levels look like theyve been cut out of the quake arena levels
i thought it was deja vu
even the lighting and the level structure looks almost like quake iii
so quake players shouldnt have any problems making their mark online with this gameas far as system requirements are concerned this game is opengl so it is quite friendly with mid performance computers
however the game does require a d accelerator
opengl is by far still the friendliest api out there when it comes to measuring frames per second on mid performance computers
the only i would recommend to players is to do a full installation of the game for increased disk performancea bug that i did notice in this game are the clipping and tearing problems
from time to time you can see the other side of the area thru a wall if you position yourself at an angle
but its not a lot and it wont distract you from playing this gamepick up this gamethis stpersonshooter game has you taking on the role of alexander munro or the lovely alexandra an ensign aboard star treks uss voyager
when voyager was catapulted into a distant corner of the galaxy  far beyond any hope of reinforcements  tuvok the ships executive officer formed the hazard team an elite corps of starfleet commandos capable of facing any threat
armed with a variety of weapons and trained to operate equipment on any alien starship the team stands ready against whatever the delta quadrant can throw at it
unfortunately munro is a bit too impulsive as she proves at the end of the first level and stands to be kicked off the team
instead fate intervenes and the team is forced to take munro along when the ship is snared by an alien ship and brought through an isodimensional rift into a vast graveyard of other alien ships
with voyager too severely damaged and drained of power to escape the hazard team is pressed into duty  boarding other ships in a desperate attempt to learn the secret of the aliens that hijacked their ship and to find the means to escape
the game relies on both alien races both familiar klingon malon hirogen and borg and new
the levels arent too long or complicated and a tight storyline beautifully keeps the game running
between the missions is a mix of cutscenes using the game engine ala jk and interactive scenes in which you prowl the halls and lounges of the voyager and mingle with its crewtheres a lot to love and to be disappointed with in this game which is nevertheless the king of trek games
level design is a mixed bag of great and bad  with my clear favorite being the scavenger ship a huge space station composed of salvaged starships like a klingon warbird and an early rd century constitution class starship that level excels because its such a mishmash that you never know what youre going to see next
the game wisely starts its action aboard an etherian starship whose wondrous insides resemble less that of a spacegoing vessel than an acid trip
unfortunately those are the early levels
the game maintains its edge with an infiltration mission on a borg cube only to lose it afterwards when you find you must infiltrate other alien ships manned by either sentry robots or the harvesters and reavers  vicious and robotlike aliens
the game also has a wonderful design engine that gives some of its nonplayer characters a wonderful individuality whether its your team mates or the aliens
however that tool embedded within the icarus engine is barely relied on for the aliens  and most of the aliens youll meet are faceless and uninteresting hordes
the exception being that set aboard the scavenger ship  where we hear klingons complaining about their food hirogen discussing their latest hunts and humans playing an unending game of d chess
gameplay is hampered at all levels by the games simplicity  though lightyears past wolfenstein much of ef has you prowling the hostile corridors of enemy territory pretty much blasting whoever you meet and finding the exit
again the scavenger level is best because its a stealth mission requiring extra precision even so you spend so much time hiding that you cant afford more than quick glimpses of the scenery
the designers probably felt like they could only make a game that was either a fragfest or a thinking mans rpg and that wed be grateful whenever it was both for even a secondthis is actually my second review of this game though i had to do a followup after having played jedi knight  which is also based on the qiii arena engine
though older than jk elite force ef holds up pretty well
its not as long as jk you can easily finish the game in a week after playing a level a night nor as difficult the enemies arent quite as overwhelming as in jk and the game relies on far less counterintuitive puzzles than that game
on the minus side its not as challenging and the simplistic game play gets annoying really quick instead of puzzles you have to locate control panels which your pda will id on any alien ship and throw their switches
there are two genuine bosslevels in the whole game and maybe twice as many true fragfests
echoing the differences between the trek and sw universes ef probably sees itself more as a thinkingmans shooter but wont make you think too hard
though you wont need to be any kind of trekkie to get through or even enjoy the game fans will appreciate how the qiii engine renders their shipi played this on my p ghz xp machine without any hickups
a basic mb graphics card was sufficient to get smooth performance why not the game is years old
i drag this game out of the dustbin now and then and find it irresistible fun  a genuine classic as much fun today as when it first debutedwhile others may feel that since the game is not released it is to early to write a review i have played the demo and in my experience the demo is a pretty good indicator of a gamewhile i usually find eidios games to fall short of quality games due to the ui this game was different
it is solid
the game engine runs better than most d shooter games
the best way to describe this game is a james bond version of thief or thief ii
you sneak around performing tasks such as stealing a truck etc
the weapons are very realistic the graphics are great and the game is funi would highly recommend giving the demo a try
my only gripe would be the lack of multiplayer
a game called venom which will be released next year or later looks a lot like this game but with coop multiplayer
so prep up with igi and get ready for venomya know i think that people who play the tombraider series get spoiled i love tombraider but it ruined me for some of the lesser games
this one has great graphics but its unbelievable how much empty space there is
you sneak into buildings that have absolutely nothing of gaming value no first aid or health boxes to recover  thats the biggest flawe i found and you cant save the game anywhere
so you go on until you finally get killed and have to start all over again
i hate that
at times its just too damned slow in reaction time and thats truly annoying again you shoot the nazi and he falls down and then gets up to shoot again
ridiculousthe immense landscapes of igi are a relief and a revelation after the tightly cloistered arenas of games like counter strike
based on a flight simulator there are apparently no physical map boundaries
my brother says he spent  mins walking to a distant mountain on one map and could still see endless terrain beyond
this is an immensely fun and engaging game of sneaking in the shadows sniping enemy soldiers and getting your butt blown off by sneaky apcs
it can be very difficult at times and this is compounded by the inexcusable lack of an in game save feature
thats why im only giving it  stars
and because there is no multiplayer option
the game play is not pure simulation sniping is too easy and enemies too dumb but thats ok because its plenty difficult as it is
dont be put off as i was by the ridiculous quotim going inquot title
i think thats just bad marketing
its a great game that more people should know aboutpros great weaponrygot to use your brain instead of attacking straight ongreat camara effects when climbing ladders and doing switchscons no ingame save data  thats means u die u restart level die too many times  loads of cheap shots u would expect from a wellexperience gamer who mastered fps gameslose the weapons when u go on next leveloverall its a good game with a few cons which could of been sorted the terrian is a tad bad you could walk into the mountains for like mins u turn round and you gotta walk mins back to where u was
sniping is good also u can shoot someone and hide and the ai dont even know where u are u got to be careful when comeing down mountains  slip and your back is broken and then its back to the start of the level no multiplayer  big shame not even a patch for multiplayer  out of   could of been better only the  stars for great weapons and their graphicsi recently bought this game and i am still trying to beat it
the missions are really cool and there are tasks ranging from putting c on the back of sa mobile sam systems to disarming nukes to shooting up tanks with your lawthe missions are long and fun and even a bit challengingi would recommend this to anyone who is into the fps genre
however if you are new to the fps genre i recommend rainbow sixyou get your moneys worth
one shot and your dead like in real lifethe game sort of reminds me of the delta force gamesits a good gamei own all the tombraider series
this one was extremely difficult at times
still the adventure drove me to try over and over and over and over and over again until i finally got it right
problem is you cant move on in an adventure until you complete everything in order
without a cheat sheet youll be lost
the worst part is that stupid lazer hk gun
lara gets killed because you cant aim it fast enough and its totally inaccurate and a real pain in the butt on the firing rangesagain no alternate paths are available frustratingtomb raider the chronicles is great
i beat it before the week was up
i got the game on my birthday well i got nothing to do so why not you know
i was so happy and i play it right way would youif you play tomb raider the last revlation when you know that her friends think shes dead but she not
play the game to find out what is going on in the chronicles gamesome of the levels are hard and some are easythe places that you drop on by are rooftops
high tech city
german uboatin this game use your brain to mindboggling puzzleshave fun like i did so good luck you going to need itdont use so many of your small medipak and large medipakthe levels get harder each time okif you get lost dont get mad just thinknotice how many countless game reviews of tomb raider usually criticize the games bugs like lara quotsinking into wallsquot and using the same old graphics and gameplay of pushing and pulling blocks to solve the puzzles
however credit must be given to the creators for making such a game that captivated thousands with the storyline and its exotic locationstomb raider chronicles pc contains two discs the first being the past adventures  more about that in a while  of lara croft and the second the much awaited level editorthe storyline of tomb raider chronicles goes like this it starts of with a memorial service of lara held days after she was trapped in the temple of horus and was assumed to be dead
 if you played tomb raider  last revelation you will know why 
her friends then starts to talk about her previous quotuntoldquot small adventures and of course you will get to play themthe first of these adventures starts off in rome the second adventure takes place in a submarine the third stars weaponless year old lara fighting demons on irelands black isle and the last takes place in an office block with lara in a matrix style suit sneaking through itthe first two adventures displays the traditonal tomb raider gameplay the first being more of puzzle solving and the second being more of action and shooting
things start to get interesting in the third and fourth adventures of lara
being weaponless in the third story you must guide year old lara through black isle as she runs from demons and solve many fun but frustrating puzzles
the creators did a pretty good job designing this stage as not only does it looks and feels like ireland it also sends a chill down your spine while playing
the gameplay of the last stage is completely different from the traditional tomb raider games
in fact it is like metal gear solid where you have to sneak up on guards and knock them out  walk and crawl to be prevented from being discovered
this stage is quite exciting especially the part where you come crashing down from the elevatortomb raider chronicles uses the same graphic and game engine  but improved  from tomb raider last revelation
all the stages are beautifully made
the only problem with this game is not the quotstanding in wallquot bug or its frustating puzzles but its voice acting
surpisingly this game has one of the worse voice acting ever especially the last stage where zip one of the characters communicates with you to give you hints
sometimes you can hardly hear himthe second disc features the level editor and a playable egyptian tutorial level
with a one hundred page manual to print out this level editor is useful for anyone wanting to create a tomb raider adventure before laras editor unleash the quot new quot lara croft in tomb raider tomb raider chronicles will be the last game in the tomb raider series using the old game engine
with its short gameplay and somewhat crappy voice acting this would have been an excellent game but it will become one of the many classics in years to come just like nintendos d version of mariothis is a perfect gift for any hardcore tomb raider fan or anyone just wanting to have some funive had this game since the  and still play it a decade later
the graphics may not be up to standards now but it still is a lot of funbut really its kind of like farmville before it existed minus a few things youll never get in that fb game by zynga real weather condition
you get hot summer days cold winter nights even hurricane season
you also get rain and snow too you have to find a wife get married and have the option of producing your own child you can build and not in that odd computer way
you have to gather supplies like actually chop wood to build your house up or make storage sheds your animals can die
they have the grave site up behind the church yes there is a church and you can confess there too
 you can pass out from exhaustion get drunk and stuff similar to that there are festivals from which you can interact in or watch
along the way you can make friends even find your true love you have missions where you can gain allies enemies items and other valuable things
this included birthdays and weddings you have a set mission of one year you have a greenhouse you dont have to friend request anyone
hehehebasically this game is great for those that like farmville or other similar games
best thing to do is go find it at ebgames or gamestop or on ebay since its super expensive it originally cost about  when it first came out
and totally go nuts with this adventure in farmingthe maracas are an absolute necessity tooand the worst part is if you want it to be a party game you need two sets of maracasi havent tried the third party sets so i dont know how they are but id certainly like to know becuase the official ones run you about  dollars a set
add the game to this and youve got yourself the cost of two dreamcastsgood things these maracas are going to be backward compatible with the new samba de amigo  game coming out
if not id be a little upsetas for the game itself listen to all these other reviews its fun
its addicting
its tiring
dont try playing when you have the flu because youll wanna throw up afterwardsthis game is a blast highly addictive very challenging
fun with or without the maracas so dont worry about those  bucks if uf dont wanna spend it
its a bit easier too wo them
its a fun game and the music was surprising and a great laugh to hear all the famous songs they included
coulda used a story mode but the challenge mode makes up for it
 way to go segatimesplitters the first fps on the playstation  console is a perfectly well balanced shooterthe four player mode is as deadly is that of goldeneye  and the single player mode offers tons of hidden things to unlock
two  small complaints though one the computer controlled bots in aracade are complete idiots and two the story mode is pitiful despite all the goodies to unlock
if theres a sequel these points need to be improved on but as it stands timesplitters is one of the most fun and addictive video games for the pstime splitters is a first person shooter from some of the same people who worked on goldeneye and boy does it show
as soon as you get used to the initially awkward control scheme youll feel the same rush you get from playing the bond inspired fps that defined console d shooters and although there isnt much here in the way of a single player story driven game you can still spend a lot of time with this title
basically there is no driving story to explain why youre shooting anything that moves but there are some fairly well designed levels and theres even a cooperative play option for these play modes
the meat of this game though is in the deathmatch game which is where it should be
good weapon design intelligent and deadly bots and the ability to build your own levels are all highpoints in the game and will make sure that you and three of your best friends will spend hours in front of the telly
my only complaints are that theres only so much you can do with the level designer due to a limited selection of tiles and the types of death match could be expanded uponbut im hoping for this to be fixed and more to be added in a sequel
if there is one game for the ps that is crying out for online support its this onei salivate at the thought of playing this over the net and being able to share custom built levels
droooooltime splitters wasnt as good as time splitters  i mean this one doesnt have any game experince
the second one was really good this one just stunk
every thing in this game isnt good
the levels look stupid and so do the people you control
all the people in the second one looked much better
theres not even a story or any thing
dont buy this game just skip this and go to time splitters  if you want to see what its like rent it firstthis game is pretty good its as good as time splitters  its just it is very hard to beat on single player modemaybe im just no good at it though
the graphics are the same as its sequal as is the gameplay and any fan of games like golden eye will like itduring the ps launch good games were scarce
but along came timesplitters and it showed some of the great graphicsat the time that the ps could handle
although the single player was ultimately forgettable it was the multiplayer that made the game so much fun
getting some of your buddies over or even with bots was a blast
the levels were great as well as the weapons which seemed reminiscent of goldeneye which had some of the same people on both teams as you all know
overall if your looking for a great multplayer game on the ps or if you want to see the original timesplitters then you should track down a copy of this gamebased in most part on thqs previous wrestling engine see wcwnworevenge amp wrestlemania  wwf mercy shines in n splendorthe opening sequence is pretty remarkable for n pushing graphicssound and visual effects to the limitsthe game itself is bothvery similar to wcwnwo revenge and wrestlemania  makingwrestling very fun without having to memorize ridiculous buttoncombinations like you do for the majority of ps games
the movesare even more fluid realistic and the collision detection is verygoodin no mercy you have many new current wwf superstars towrestle with including rakishi eddie g chris benoit dean malenkothe dudleys and many others
in addition to the superstarsalready present there are many you need to unlock during the progressthrough your game
it is rumored that even andre the giant is one ofthe hidden characters
also added is many more arenas and backstageareas
there is a parking lot backstage boiler room bar andarenas include backlash survivor series smackdown raw kotrwrestlemania and more
the outside ring areas are pretty cool
ilike the bar because you can do maneuvers off a pool table
alsothere is a new match that will makes the game very challenging theladder match
what an awesome idea however i think it needs to betweaked just slightly
it is very hard to win said match as it takeslonger to climb and tap the a button than your fallen opponent takesto recover often resulting in your opponent to knock the ladder overwhen you are ever so closethe createawrestler mode has beenexpanded greatly as well
many will like the new features but thesaving component could be a bit easier and more clearthechampionship mode is the heart of the game where instead of going awhole year like you did in wrestlemania  in no mercy you pick abelt to chase after
the belts are broken down into individualchapters resulting in anywhere from  bouts
what is really neatis the cut scenesangles bewteen the matches and how the story unfoldsdepending on whether you win or lose a match
if you win matches youearn money in which you can spend at the smackdown mall for additionalmoves costumes weapons or hidden charactersarenasokay nowafter all that praise what makes it shy of  stars
like i statedpreviously the ladder match can be a little to hard or unrealisticeven in the easy mode
the manual is a little vague in areas likestats amp shopping
the saving component could be a bit more clearas well as the ranking tables
lastly some experienced gamers mayeven find the easy levels difficult when it comes to handicappedmatches
you get doubleteamed often which makes it very hard torecover and win even if you get an early lead
some matches you winon pure luck not on skill or how badly you pummel the cpu controlledcharacterbut all this aside this is the best wrestling game ihave ever played yet on any platformi wont go on about the different options found in the game as other reviews have covered that
what i will say is that this game is by far one of the funnest games youll play on the n
even those who despise wrestling will find themselves having fun with this game as it is amazingly easy to pick up and play
there is some considerable slow down but that can be dealt with by turning off background music during gameplay  a small sacrifice to make
the create a wrestler function adds a great amount of time to its replayability as you can make dozens of new wrestlers to play withas was stated in an earlier review there is a bug that causes info to be lost
buyers might want to be cautious about buying this game and its because of this frustrating bug that i give this game a  and not  stars
otherwise the game itself is a blast
get three friends together and plug this one in for a great timeno mercy was a great game title for the  it played just like wrestlemania  but it had a longer and more personal career mode along with a lot of extra perks like being able to buy arenas and outfits and even special moves
this game had everything you could think ofladder match royal rumble hardcore matches that went everywhere in the back and of course all of the belts hidden characters to go along with the already established 
man given roster on the game
the create a wrestler mode was phenomenal and this one didnt get oldthe problem with no mercy was that it was released with a defective
the core memory of the game pack was defective and it would erase your data every now and then just like nba live  on snes if you had too many created players
a total nuisance
from what i know there were only a few perfect games where it didnt do that and if you had one you were very lucky
i think i went through  different ones before i finally got a perfect onehonestly if you feel that you could deal with having to play each career mode over and over again everytime it erases to get all of your belts back then sure go ahead and get this one
if you know that you cant deal with that then i wouldnt bother as unfortunate as that is because besides the whole memory problem no mercy was a great game
again think about the trade off before you buy this oneive always loved wrestling games and they just keep getting better and better
ive been into them since the snes days
and when the  came out wwf war zone became my favourite then attitude but then thq started bringing out there wcw titles
i hated the wcw so i never played them for quite a long time
i never had a go at their first release they brought out but i somehow ended up with a copy of wcw vs nwo revenge at first i was focused to find every flaw i could and put it down and never look at it again but each day i found myself playing git more and more and more and when thq lost the rights to wcw they picked up the rights to the wwf and released a game that became my new favourite instantly wwf wrestlemania 
but as the n was on its way out thq gave one last release and made the best wrestling game to date
ive played a lot of wrestling games and a lot have come and gone and a lot have had lasting value and quality but none like this game
next to wrestlemania arcade this game is the bestthere is a tonne of wrestlers who each have  slots
what i mean by that is when you select your wrestler you can select  different versions of that wrestler with a different look of clothing or hairstyle or something
some even have a different character all together
you just press one of your buttons to toggle through them all
and a great option is that you can change every single character
you can change their cloths name music everything except there moves
that mean you can completely replace a wrestler who is a default in the game if you want
or you might just like to change one of the  rikishis into yokozuna or change one of the slots of kane and clone undertaker so that he has the tombstone as his finisher instead of the last ride
the best thing about it is that you do not need a memory card every thing is saved onto the cartridge itselfthere are heaps of matches and you can choose pretty much whatever rules you want
from pin falls hardcore iron man tag  on   on  cage rumble and even a great ladder much that is a lot of fun to play with friends
the best thing is you can now go back stage
you just whip your opponent up the entrance way and you can fight in the stage area then you can whip them back stage again and fight down a corridor that has doors that lead to the boiler room a locker room with a table you can smash your opponent through a pool room that you can slam your foe through the snooker table and a car park
back in the arena you can also send your enemy crashing through the announcers table
and you can pick weapons out of the crowed at any time and even use the ring steps
there is a lot of weapons to grab almost everything from the wcw revenge game is back but not all but there is also great big beer cans al snows head books briefcases fire extinguishers even a big cheese
there heaps to findyou can battle in a kind of season match that has story lines to follow but once you have completed that it becomes very boring that has no lasting value there
there is also a survivor mode
which is basically an iron man way battle royal
you have to eliminate  other wrestlers to win
you can throw them over the rope to eliminate them pin then make them submit or tko them
if you make it all the way through you get andre the giant as a hidden character and he becomes selectable but the more opponents you eliminate the more points you get to use in the shop
the shop is a place where you buy new things from weapons to costumes even movesthe create a wrestler is terrific
the moves look great and there is so many more new moves added to the game then the last titles
plus there about  slots with  each in them to choose fromthe controls work very well and there is not just one special move to every one all depending on where you are wether you are grappling at there feet on the rope ect then great moves can be donewhere there is good you have to accept the bad as well
if thq where still making games for the  then they would not these flaws and use it to improve the next version but everyone is done with the  no inring intro
your wrestler comes out to his theme music and titan tron video but he only poses on the stage area they dont walk into the ring anymore and do there in ring poses tag team partners only come out together in season mode
they are separate intros in exhibition modes its really annoying in royal rumble modes when somebody is eliminated and you have to wait about  seconds for the next wrestler to run down to the ring and get in they should have shown that in the back ground and let the game resume instead of doing it the way they have
it is also annoying when you have your spirit meter flashing to preform your special moves and it has run out by the time the next wrestler has gotten in the ring they have taken out the test of strength showdown
in the last few games if both opponents tried to grapple at the same time they would lock into a test of strength and whoever was the better of the two would get the advantage to preform a move to break it up the undertakers theme music is a song is raw
not whatever his theme song was at the time either american bad by kid rock or rollinrollin rollin by limp bizket
why didnt thq just give his old dark side theme or something there are great double team moves but there are a few missing it would have been nice to have the double choke slam that kane and undertaker used to do
or the tennessee jam that too cool did when one would hold there opponent in a back breaker and the other would jump of the top rope and leg drop the guy being held
or the move the hardy boys do where one kneels down in a doggy position and the other springs off him for the sidekick there is too many mick foleys i think having  of him in the game is too many particularly in rumbles
but you can just edit over himdespite those flaws
this is still the best wrestling game there is
you probably would be able to fix some of those flaws in a rom version maybe but this is the still played by me n versionso layeth the smack down if ya smell what the sock is cookin
and thats the bottom line or you can suck iti wouldnt get this game now due to all the new wrestlers in the wwf including the alliance of wcw and ecw
but when it first came out it was the best game out there
it is very fun to play
the only thing is it is hard to learn how to do the special moves of the wrestlersexpeoples elbow stone cold stunner sink face d must i go on
if you dont care about how up to date the wrestlers are and just care about the quality of fun get it
if you do care about the up to date of the wrestlers wait for a new wrestling video game to come outthis is one of the most realistic wrestling game on the n and no mercy hits the spot with great visuals and some really nice story mode
the game is exclusive to the n and sticks to it as it is one of the coolest wwef games ever
it features some great wrestlers such as stone cold and the rockduhhnot many wrestling games get me to say wow but this game really does earn its wow
it scores big time with awesome and really incredible matches such as ladder matches and cage matches
now even though this game is similar to wwfs wrestlemanio  it is far superior then that as it has better visuals and way better body movement and what is great aboutwwf no mercy is that it has the same exact controls as wwf wrestlemania   so if you were a wrestlemanio  addict like myself you will probably get and easy feeling on this game especially how its more of an update of wm  then any other
the game does earn its rating and i stick by it
wwf no mercy is one of the most intence wrestling games on the ngraphicly this game was far more superior then the smackdown series back on the playstation
it had cutting edge body movement and the visuals were just superb
it really showed what n is made out of and it really is one of a kindgameplay is pretty similar to wrestlemanio  and it seems more of an update then anything els
i cant go into this except say if you knew how to play wm very well then this will be a piece of cake for yousoundpretty normal nothing new
similar to wmthe sound is average the gameplay was obviously use from wm and i dont want people arguient to me over this but some of it is
except for the new characters that were added the controls are excellent just like the wm controls cutting edge graphics on the n and shows what its made out of earns this game a out of it is one of the best n wrestling gamesalso recommendedwcw vs nwowrestlmanialatesfirst off  there is a glitch in the game that will cause you to lose saved game info
like many others  it happened to me a couple of days ago
  this glitch  therefore  should not be a deterrentthat being said  this is a great game
fans of wrestlemania  will pick up on no mercy fast  as the same engine is used
things run smoother  and hit detection has been cleaned up
with the exception of a stray quotpeoples elbowquot  hits actually appear to hit when they cause damagethe storyline has been improved upon  although it isnt perfect
in wmk  there was very little that would happen
interfering superstars would say one of two things  vince would always take your title and face you in a singles matchhere in no mercy  the plot can change based on whether you win or lose
alliances are formed and broken  and theres a large variety of matches you can end up in
it can become repetitive  however  as you have to lose matches  to complete all the storylines
worse yet  even on expert difficulty  it can be hard to lose a matchthe ai is about the same as before  and increasing the difficulty only increases the ammount of time the cpu spends countering you
while the game is still a solid challenge  one would hope for a smarter opponentthe quests for the titles are fun  and the characters look  walk  and fight like the real superstars
unfortunately  in wwf championship mode  they all talk like steve austin or the rockthe gameplay is near flawless  with the only flaw being the slowdown when four characters are involved
they have fixed my biggest gripe  with wmk  by adding more tag moves  including the dudley death drop and special flying attacks
while this doesnt add too much  the  gameplay was already great to begin withcreate a superstar is even better this time around  adding more to work with  including more finishers  more clothing  and more taunts
and with the smackdown
mall  you can purchase even more
and this time around  you can make women wrestlerswith smacdown
mall  you can purchase props  weapons  special moves  and wrestling attire  both familliar and original
purchase mankinds original outfit  the rocks   shirt  or original outfit   and use them to better customise your superstars
cant find a finisher you like
perhaps trhe fireball  burning combo  or continuous dvdpowerbombwhile i wish that they had the quotcreate a stablequot and quotcreate a tauntquot options from smackdown
  know your role for the playstation  neither feature is necessary
the same is true for the naming of finishers from the original smackdown  which appears in neither game
these are all minor flavor isuues  and do not spoil the gameall in all  no mercy is a great game
it would have five stars easily if not for the slowdown  the fact they all  talk the same  and the need to lose against a rather dumb ai
if none of these bother you  this is an excellent game
i would buy it with no hesitation myself  given all the cool features
i recommend it to any fan of the earlier games  any fand of the wwf  or any fan of wrestling in generalthe gamplay is great the wreaselers look real its as great game but  problems
one whwn your opponent is getting up and u hit em un the top with a move that hit it dos not hit em
 is how long it takes to create a pep wreasler hour to  minits
third is when you do a special four a first move they kick outstiil buy it thupeace outits worth all of the money that is spent on it but you will fint that it is also very hard i whoud sugg geting the stragety guide and than buy itthis game is still very fun even  years later
although the graphics are not the best the engine used in this game is still superb
there are a lot of characters to choose from and the smackdown store is awesomethis game i think is a very great game i played it and i was thinking look at all the stuff you can do in this the rock hhh look very very bad they could of done a better job on them
i think this game is greatif youre old enough to remember playing this game on the original nes and getting issues if nintendo power in the mail just for the maps congratulations
this game mostly just follows the monotmous cycle of go to town kill monsters to get gold to buy better weapon go to next town get more gold to buy next better weaponthis game is from back in the days where you knew how challenging a monster was based on what color it was is it a red slime or purple silme
somehow though the game is still compelling making you want to see just was in that next down or what might be on the th level of that identical level cavethe scant backstory allows your mind and imagination to fill in the blanks as to the heros past and the villians intent
overall the game is simple classic fun free from the excess that tends to weight down the modern rpgdragon warrior probably wasnt known as well as final fantasy was here
but be known that dragon warrior was the best selling video game series ever in japanexcept there its known as dragon questtwo games into one what more could you ask
you get the original dragon warrior as the descendant of loto and your task is to rescue the princess from the clutches of dracolord and defeat him as welldragon warrior ii is a much longer game than the first one
you must assemble a series of three party members as you move out to slay hargon the evil lord
you do an awful lot of walking in this game and at times you can get stucki remember playing the first one for the nes and i still enjoy it because not its completely enhanced
i dont know whats been changed in the second one however but im still enjoying itdragon warrior fans this is a must have
because once youre done with this itll make you love dragon warrior iii even morei would like to fix my previous review and write a more clearer one
so bare with me
up until last fall ive never heard about dragon warrior
i know you all think that im stupid for missing out on a great rpg like dragon warrior so let me explain
ive been into the video game market for  years since the age of  its been difficult for me to know what games were coming out when they were coming out and what they were
it wasnt until i got the internet and when i searched on this website did i realize that i missed out on alot of really great games dragon warrior being one of them
dragon warrior was the first rpg game ever released in the united states
these two games were released in  back on the nintendo entertainment system
they were the first games to pioneer the idea of land roaming monster battling and building character experience
enough said
now to the gamesdragon warrior i even though this game was short it was difficult for me
as ive said ive never played dragon warrior before so it was new to me
you are the descendant of the dead and legendary hero loto formerly known as erdrick back on the the original dragon warrior for the nes
you as one person set out on a quest to rescue lady lora daughter of king lars xvi of alefgard and defeat the evil dracolord
in this game there are several towns were there are inns weapons and armory shops
you will of course need to equip some weapons ad armory to become more powerful
during the course of the game you will also get the chance of equiping more powerful equipment
you are also supposed to find two things in this game the rainstaff and the sunstone
once you obtain the loto seal go to a shrine south of the town of rimulbar talk to the elderly man and he will give you a rainbow drop
you then use the rainbow drop to form a bridge to get to dracolords castle
you must be above level  to defeat dracolords two forms one as a human like creature and the other as a monster
it was easy for me
this game alone i give it  stars and abovedragon warrior iithis game is way harder than its predecessor
in this game you the prince of lorasia must find the princess of moonbrook and the prince of cannock and defeat hargon
the storyline in this game takes place  years after dragon warrior i you get to make up a name for you the prince of lorasia but the computer makes up the names for the prince of cannock and the princess of moonbrook
this game is wut makes the package a great bargain
of course theres plenty of training and objectives that one must clear in order to have a showdown with hargon and his master sidoh who makes hargon look like nothing
theres plenty of things to do to keep u occupied in the game while training
i give this game alone  stars and above
overall i am happy that nintendo thought about bringing these two classics back to the modern age
i hope nintendo and squareenix plan on releaseing more of the dragon warrior series on the nintendo systemsits a good game much better than smackdown for the psyou may have seen my consumer report on this item
well heres the review
by the time you read this smackdown know your role will have been released and is probably sitting in your hands right now
you then already know the joy
sm uses the same game engine and ideas from smackdown
 season mode special referee all the original modes are there along with some new ones ladder matchesoh joy heelinacell oh rapture
 tlc youll figure out what it means casket matches basically any match you could ever imagine the wwf doing is herethe graphics have been polished nicely while keeping the arcade feel that drove away a few gamers last time around
the sound has improved with real entrance themes along with voiceovers yeah you heard me from all of the over  wwf superstars included in the game such as rikishiboo
 kurt angleoh its truethe rock and dareisayit too cool
my only gripe with the characters is the fact that stone cold steve austin arguably one of the wwfs biggest stars is a hidden character
thats right spunky you gotta unlock him
even though it isnt that hard to do so play season mode make it to backlash win your match hes unlocked its still a little weird
just hope its not like last year you didnt unlock the characters themselves just the ability to create them
that was one of the earlier games biggest flaws
control is tight but you can only do a small number of moves unlike no mercy for the n with over  moves per character so youll end up using the same moves over and over
not too good for creativity even with the new matchesratings out of  graphics  for the last playstation wwf game its purty
sound  good
all the whacks music and attitude are there
control  tight responsive but also repetitive
funocity  not the best but its closeoverall  out of  the arcadey feel detracts from the fun and replay value but youll have fun while it lasts
a pretty good game
and for those who question the validity of this review i got the game from electronics boutique in alton
theres your proof that i played itthis game has the same graphics as the original but has a bigger match list
hell in the cell is on the card tlc and the casket match which is lackluster
season mode is done a little better but would be greatly enhanced later on in the series
the game looks good the controls remain the same which is awesome
this is actually the last platinum game for the ps before the ps which would actually release one month after this
but congrats to wwe the games keep getting betterthis is thqs fifth wrestling game for the playstation
since the original wrestling game they have come a long way as now there are dozens of wrestlers like steve austin the rock the undertaker mankind and the hardy boyz featured in the game but there are also dozens of match types like ladder matches casket matches cage matches table matches tag team matches handicapped matches iron man matches guest referee matches and so on
another fantastic thing about the game are the details like videos that play when wrestlers to come down to the ring
there are several different arenas to wrestle in anything from the smackdown and raw arenas to wrestlemania and judgement day payperview arenas
the fans are also so detailed they hold up signs based on who is wrestling in the current match
with all of that out of the way the season mode is the best thing about the game
with a season mode you chose a wrestler you can chose a different wrestler during the season and play an entire continuous year of wwf action
wrestling weekbyweek working your way up the ladder to the seven different wwf championships
there are even story lines to follow in the season such as injuries runins and the evil plots of the wwfs owner vince mcmahoni had a whole lotta fun playing this game when it was originally released and i still have a lotta fun playing it today
unlike the first smackdown which has had its time and is now no longer fun to play this game is still enjoyable
has a lot more wwe wrestlers to choose from unlike the original game
and it has better graphics and a much better story mode
i always enjoy playing as either triple h or tazz my ecw favorite on this game
this is still worth buying today for any wwe fanwhile i really wanted to play this game because im a bit sick of the newer ones and how godawful they are
i think i found it more fun when i was eight rather than now
i mean its still fun but then again im not into wrestling anymore
as i said though its still pretty funthis game boasts brilliant graphics that never seem sto slow down regardless of how many combatants are all milling about
the different modes of play are also top class
the best feature in my mind is the extremely indepth buildawrestler section
you really can create precisely whatever you have in mind with an exhausting amount of faces physiques tweaks and colourshade meters
my only gripe is that if you are playing a game against more than one opponant the controls have a tendancy to make your character focus on just one enemy which is very very frustrating when youve levelled somebody and youre about to pummel the next guy but your wrestler wont turn around
they seem to just stand there staring at the body on the floor when the other guy is kicking the chocolate outta you
anyway fine game
fantastic fun when youve got a group of drunken mates aroundthe graphics could be better
but they are not that bad
it has a certain feel to the game that draws you into the story and the events
the controls are a little odd but with a little practice you can get the hang of them
although in high stress situations i have the odd moment of poor control
some of the missions are a little hard and you do have to use all your characters moves and skills to survive
i have been waiting for this game for a while and i have not been disappointed
its fast fun and for the most part logical with its level flowi think it deserves a solid  stars
it is alot of fun and one that i am happy to havethis was one of the first games i bought for my ps
i bought it since you could fight with and without guns and you could these awesome fighting moves
the game is awesome in every way
the story is very simple and the controls are a little hard for an unexperienced gamer
the length of the game is decent and the camera occasionaly gets in the way
this is why it is getting a  star rating
other than that the game is good
its not to violent and it is a lot of fun once you get the hang of the controlls
i recommend this game to most people who are able to learn the controlls of a game easilyi played this game back in the day but i never finished it
great quality  delivery speed
i think this is the first game i played from rockstarthe tomb raider series is great but by tr was beginning to get repetitive
oni is essentially a darker faster more challenging futuristic tomb raider game for those who have outgrown the tomb raider seriesthis was my first time playing this type of game on a game console i had previously played the tomb raider series only on macs
while using a controller and not a standard keyboard was a little odd the controls were easy to learn aided greatly by the interactive training stage before the main adventure begins
oni also includes actual handtohand combat which is often a much better option than using the various weapons
the enemies are also far smarter than in the tomb raider series
and the multiple levels of play provide increasing challenges for expert playersthe action is fastpaced and thoughtprovoking the storyline intriguing and the music excellent
this is certainly not a gran turismo  or an ssx but oni is still a wonderful game with good replay valueit takes a rd person perspective similar to tomb raider with the camera always following behind you and over your head
the controls start off as complicated for the average ps player but a person used to computer games shouldnt find it too strange with the left analog mapping to the arrow keys and right analog mapping to the mouse for the average computer st person shooterthe combat system is simple with your standard punching and kicking techniques
youll gain new moves as the game progresses but beyond the basic combos they tend to be difficult to pull off in real combat situations and not worth the effort
the game does an excellent job representing the realism of guns
fighting two or more armed opponents when you are not armed will inevitably result in death
the computer ai is even smart enough to know that if theres a gun on the ground its to its advantage to go and pick it up rather than continue fighting hand to hand
unfortunately the computer ai has no problem doing suicide attacks with rocket launchers inside of rooms taking away from games realism and making certain fights frustratingthe levels while being well designed and sometimes vast have no eye candy in them
backgrounds are plain and unexciting
the people move fluidly enough when fighting but no special attention was given to rendering when they are talking with each other during story scenesthe game also shows some pretty amateur problems
youll see enemys arms sticking through walls and you sometimes are even able to hurt the enemies through the wall
turning properly when close to a wall will often let you see on the other side of itthe story line is entertaining in the anime cyberpunk motif with some very well done voice acting
i was drawn into it at certain points being angry at characters and wanting to seek revenge
theres even a split point in the story line that will affect the final ending of the gameunfortunately rockstar took out the multiplayer combat mode of the game in order to get it out on time
this reduces the replay value immensely and theres little incentive to play again after youve beaten both endings to the gameoverall its a fun game to play through and enjoy
its worth the money if you enjoy the rd person beatup style game
it wont win any awards for pushing the hardware that its ondespite all the reviews i read on this game i rather enjoyed it
i did however beat the whole thing in less than  hours owing not to my gaming prowess but rather to the lack of having a life
ha ha ha
anyways i thought the d environments were interesting and easier to navigate due to their sparse nature
they gave the game the not so distant future feel
what was difficult was when you actually fought
the controls are a bit aggrivating and the enemies skill at exploiting that fact get better with each level
you can forget about using weapons at long ranges until you get either the railgun like weapon or the screaming cannon thingy
the screaming cannon is one of the more creative innovations in weapons i have seen in games
basically you shoot it at your target and it stalks the poor person as it drains them of life
some victims actually whimper and say things like i dont want to dieand for all you saddists out there there are quotinnocentquot civilians you can beat up and kill
they whimper and beg for their lives too
just make sure you dont start abusing them until they give you something like hypos or ammo clipslastly there are codes available for this game
some make you tiny huge help you to change your character make your head enormous or make you invisible
they enhance replayability  another down side is that they removed the multi player feature before release
too bad it might have been fun
overall i think the game deserves  stars for entertaining me and making me laugh out loud at a few points
so rent it first to see if you like iti enjoyed this game at first oni kicks butt and i love her short purple hair and how smart she is
the controls are frustrating but you get used to them once youve practiced the first level
there are  levels total and the game is a maze
you have to figure out what direction to pursue that will complete the level
what bothered me is that halfway through the game onis i forget her real nameguide and best friend gets kidnapped and murdered
from there oni is set on revenge and the game stops being fun after that
there were a few levels that i had to skip because i couldnt figure them out
as oni retrieves more and more information on her identity her uncle gets killed and her intent on revenge increases did i also mention that her company turns against her and she has to go rogue
then she learns that her brother is the main villain and in the end she has to kill him too i skipped that part also
the game does not end happily even though she survives all the chaos and violence thrown her way
for an animatedanime game it got really intense
onis best friends destroyed face is plugged into a computer that oni has to destroy towards the end and even though its animated the graphics were creepy at that point
the fighting is fun throughout but some levels are confusing and the revenge part wasnt fun
i discovered a website that gives codes for unlimited health and that helped me beat the levels otherwise this game would have been impossible
theres too many villains to defeat and way too much firepower to overcome in certain levelshere are the codes to help in this gamemaster codepress select during game play and highlight help
then press l l l square circle squareunlimited healthenable the master code then press r l r circleunlimited ammunitionenable the master code then press l l l lone hit killsenable the master code then press l r circle squarelevel skipenable the master code the press l r l lthe website is gamewinnerscomthis is for hard core gamers and for those who like to kill villains the whole time
if the descriptions listed above dont bother you then you should enjoy this game
i was surprised at some of the content in this game as mentioned above but i was happy to finish the game once i started it
oni started out really well but its not on my favorites listi have spent a whole lot of quality time with oni over the weekend and i have come to the conclusioni love this game
onis gameplay reminds me of a cross between fighting force and metal gear solid  two games which i love
the graphics are great and the levels are huge
oni has quite a few moves which are fun to use while fighting
the weapon selection is very cool too especially with the force feedback on
the challenges at the end the first two levels were nicely done
i cant wait to see what else is in store for me on the later levels
the only drawbacks to oni is the sound which seems to get disjointed at times when the characters are talking
this can be somewhat annoying at times but fortunately it doesnt happen enough for it create too much of a problemoverall oni is challenging enough to keep you playing and will keep you wanting to get to the next level
with  huge levels oni will keep you busy for quite a while
this game wins with great graphics and fun gameplayfinally another game worth owning on the ps has been releasedrecommendedthis is my first play station  game i have been waiting to get this game ever since i herd about it that has been a while now
since i have been waiting for this game i held great  expectations for this i was disipointed
the first thing i noticed about this game was how complicated the controlls were and the people who made the game took the time for u to get used to the controll that was good but the falts start coming out when you start playing threw the levels what i mean is when the enemies fall they sometimes seep threw the walls doors or anything they fall onto it is really quite appaling since the power of the playstation  can do so much to fix that
the other thing i  did not like is the characters in the cut scenes look like they have no life to them
but the game has so much to offer like the really challinging enemy ai the enemies are actually not stupidwell let me just say i love this game
its ten times more fun than doom  in my opinion
the graphics arent as good but the game play is amazing
that being said i have oni for the pc and i am thinking about getting it for the ps because i upgraded my pc and got a  bit os and now oni no longer works on it
my biggest fear is that the controls on the ps will really suck like they do on so many games
medal of honor frontline ect
but i have found here on amazon pretty cheap and im still deciding weather or not to buy it
anyway it is a super fun game with a great story that keeps you guessing opi really like this one
the controls are a bit complicated but i think thats one sign of a complex game that takes a while to master
once you got the controls uh under control the game takes off and is really a blastbig levels
really smooth graphics and interaction
good sound
not too cheesy etc etc etc
a really balanced and good gamethe graphics arent the best the ps has to offer but theyre suited to the type of game oni is
ive never been one to be balk at a game just because graphics arent cutting edgetheres way more to this game than its cover appearancebuy oni and get into it
for the price its now going for itll be well worth itit has taken awhile for the good old rpg style
but now there is a good one
this game is just plain fun and full of all the stuff that makes these games addictiveyou start as a lowly air pirate and go in search of fame fortune and saving damsels in distressthe graphics although not amazing are not bad and do add a certain flavor to the gamemy only complaint is as usual a major lack of speech
when are they going to release these games with speechotherwise this game is excellent and a hell of alot of funskies of arcadia is a fun addicting game that will steal away your nights and weekends until you beat it
the colors the fights the story all will be imprinted on your brain for some time to come
but if you are a person of little patience and less tolerance maybe you should consider a raincheck because this game may drive you to the brinkallow me to explain if you will
skies of arcadia follows loosely the guidelines set by the final fantasy series
you will have a group of three to four warriors and you will find and defeat a series of enemies
weapons and combat skills will abound while magic will grow and engulf the world around you
to this tried and true style several major and important advancements were made ship battles
you will love this the first second you play it
not unlike some of the monster battle games of the world you will order your ship to make  moves for a given turn
this can be magic repair attack or defend
then you will okay it and sit back
the four turns will be played out in front of you not unlike a movie with your ship and your enemy swirling about and attacking
then the  turns will end and you will be given a chance to make  move moves
battle goes on until either you or your enemy plunges from the skies in flames
however this sounds to you i promise this will be one of the better aspects of the game to youmove to move combat
not unlike the ship battles above personal combat follows a turn basis
instead of having time bars that fill until it is your turn each side will decide what their warriors will do and then they will do it
when a person goes in determined by what their speed is
strategy evolves around your ability to guess what you enemy will do and counter it
boss battles are some of the most inspiring and fun things you will partake inbut not all is flowers in the skies of arcadia
much like ff you will often be ambushed by random enemies
the difference here is how often it happens
throughout the game you are expected to find or discover your next area of importance
well this is rather hard when ever fifth step of tenth seconds you have to fend off hordes of enemies
i personally tired every way possible to avoid those alltocommon attacks but to no avail
there is a actual disinsentive to explore because you dont want to spend hours fighting your way in possibly finding some weapon or goody and then spending more time getting back out so you can continue on your way
and there is no relief from this tedium
only towns are safe for you to explore freely
now i understand why this is in the game but come on
i dont want to have to fight an army everytime i go into some cave
this feature needed to be spread out a littlealso of annoyance is the lack of dialouge
everything is writte with the exception of a few simple and comically dsiplaced soundbytes
in the end i think i should have been happy for just those but a bit more actual taliking and a bit less eyewearying reading would have been niceso in conclusion this is a must have for your average dc owner although we are a dying breed
but if you have a short fuse might want to look elsewhere because i am a patient and mellow tempered person and i nearly gouged my eyes out from the almost constant combatwhat do you want
sweeping epic battles cool characterizations this has it and more
the only downside to this game is random battles
that is one thing i despise more than anything in console rpgs
it did keep it from getting a perfect rating from me but other than that this game excels to the nth degree
it almost seems to pay homage to every rpg before in some way or another
while grandia ii was stoic and dull at times skies keeps you flying
aika rules
man my fanboy genes just kicked ini found this game to be a colorful and imaginative adventure
then i went back to my psx and played final fantasy viii
the only problem with criticisms of the last few games is that they came before this masterpiece
oh and they were also masterpieces
i found the storyline and gameplay to be remarkably like ffvii except for a few quotaye ayequots and quothahaquots and the only problem i have with that isnothing except the fact that people are criticizing ffvii just dont it is the game ok
seriously though i thought that they really had no personal reason to save the world like cloud they were misunderstood at the beginning like cloud and i their attitudes annoyed me like tifa and the final boss was toomysterious with almost no developement of the character
and yes i know that i am being a bit unfair on that
hey the underdevelopement is kind of like ultimeciafrom ff
which also came before soa
see a connection here
actually the gameplay was great but dont diss final fantasy before you think about the similarities and the fact voices of the characters in this game get so annoyinggoodgame buy dont diss final fantasy halike a couple of other people who already reviewed this i too am a devoted final fantasy fan who has played lots of rpgs and been somewhat disappointed in most of them
ive played only three sega rpgs and of the three two of them are perhaps my most hated rpgs of all time game arts lunarsss and grandia
the third was panzer dragoon saga which i absolutely loved
i couldnt stand lunar and grandia because of their overblown humor and mindless cheerfulness
yech
well the more i read about skies of arcadia the more it sounded like those game arts games
i had no plans to buy it
but more and more i kept hearing friends who shared my tastes saying that theyd played soa and that it was a stunningly great game
so i decided to give it a shot
i must admit for the first few hours of the game my fears seemed to be confirmed not much conflict not much drama just a lot of cheerily romping around the world
but slowly the characters started to win me over
they dont have miles of depth but they are irresistably likeable
the story took off and kept a perfect pace until the very end of the game
if theres anything this game does better than recent final fantasy games its the impeccable dungeon design and the joy of exploration it gives youif the characters were just a little deeper and the plot was more original it was quite predictable id easily give skies of arcadia  stars
as it is its still one of the best rpgs on the market today and id say its easily a mustplay for even the most casual rpg fanby the way i understand that a sequel is underway as i type thisthis game isnt quite perfect but its almost there
the game starts off with a girl trying to escape from the imperial armadathe bad guys
well she gets caught but it just so happens that an air pirate ship happens to be nearby ready to rid take over this ship and take all its valuables
thats where our main character and hero vyse comes along
accompanied by his friend aika vyse goes after bad guy on this ship who has this mysterious girl that they were chasing earlier
vyse eventually catches up with the bad guy dont quite remember his name the bad guy sicks his little pet on vyse and aika and bails the ship like a coward
thats where the story pretty much starts
the beginning a little dull but this is where it gets better
the battle mode is nothing original but there are a few quite nice innovations like spirit points which allows you the character to pull of special moves
there still are mp magic points but they arent used as frequently
the animation of certain special moves and magic are quite appealing and i must say that they did an excellent job with the characters facial expressions
the overall scenery in different areas are remarkable
it looks like the folks over at sega put in a little overtime working on the designs and animation for this game
the overall story is quite original believe it or not with a few influences from movies and such
the characters are likeable and do not get annoying
cough cough squall cough cough as a long time lover of the final fantasy series i must say that this game is quite refreshing after having to play final fantasy  and  all in all i recommend this game even if you like rpgs just a tad
by the way the reason i gave this game only  stars is that random battles are a little too random
but its just minor when you realize how great this game really is
buy and enjoyskies of arcadia is a beautiful rpg that is just shy of perfectionthe plot is solid with just enough twist to be surprising but not deus ex machina the locations are many and varied and battle are strategically turnbased but are highly intuitive and sufficiently challenging
the real jewel of the game is the ship battles which take the same concept to the skies
plug in your commands and watch whats usually a good moviethe game is not without a few flaws
first its impossible to completely level up one characters weapon to do so you need  chams and only  exist in the game one was available for download from dreamcast online leaving the true trainer to slog through a vmu minigame in hopes of obtaining magic  less drastic but more annoying is the frequency of random battles while traveling in the ship  sometimes less then  seconds between battles
good luck if you were treasure hunting or trying to get somewhere in a hurry theres a way around it but not until more than  of the way through the gamedespite these drawbacks skies of arcadia is one of the best rpgs ive played and i highly recommend itsince the launch of the dreamcast ive been longing for some kind of game which can occupy me for a long time to comegames such as crazy taxi wwf royal rumble nfl they are all great games especially when your used to playing the playstationplaying games in enhanced graphics from  to  bit really does prove to enhance your need to keep on playing
phantasy star online was my first rpg that i loved the most see phantasy star online review i made but after well over  hours of play ive ran sick of it nowskies of arcadia is the next purchase ive made and i did not know anything about this game apart from judging from the back of the cover i made a good choice i believe although the game does not possess any online gaming functions you can however go on the internet via dreamcast and download addons for the game to enhance your gaming pleasures although ive yet to venture that far but i will do so in the near futuregraphics  game is set in a fictional world where boat like ships are capable of flying and the scene from different cultures of the world seem to be from different time zoneswhether its islands full of rain forests medieval castles to the buildings of the stereotypical far east buildingsall captured of course in a splendid d rendered display which is exquisite to look at
whether your looking at the special abilities of your character to the falling waterfalls of the scenery all look realistic and runs smoothlygame play  skies of arcadia is played in a third person view like diablo on the pc or phantasy star online on the dreamcast
this is how you would tend to explore in the realms of arcadia but fighting in the world involves a different kind of interaction
the screen from wither the world map palace or cave depending where you are performs a transition effect and goes into the fight which you look upon your characters as you control them with a series of commands like any japanese style rpg ie
final fantasylasting appeal  i do find that this game does sort of attach itself onto the person who is playing it
people who prefer playing rpgs rather than any other platform of game would definitely play this game for a long time and lose sleep over it since it has a wide variety of quests and gamers would like to venture further into the game as quickly as possibleside quest this section is made because i believe it is relevant to all those who strive to become nothing but perfection within the game
playing the game you would no doubt want to become the best that you can possibly be and the game itself lures you into doing that but if gamers wish to just go straight through the game then thats their own choice
i believe that people would want to go on search for the perfect crew as you later go on a recruiting mission and would like to recruit every single person in the gamecons  memory card most people have already got a memory card but the game is so good you may want to explore the game further with the side quest called pinto
this feature allows you to go on search with the vmu and find any extra items within the mini game for the vmu
although it sounds like a good feature for the game it has a bad side to it that in order to play it you must however have a blank vmu with nothing else on it
i found myself buying an extra memory card not for this particular purpose but just for the future of games i intend to purchase for this platform
although not necessary a memory card would be a nice thing to purchase if you have the spare cash for itvast sceneries i believe that the game at certain points are too large and prove to be pointless
for those who have yet to purchase this then you will encounter cities that prove to be a puzzle in themselves just to find a particular building
unless your smarter than me which is almost  definite then you wont have this problem
i believe that it takes too long to climb ladders in the gamei do not complain about the characters climbing speed but the length of most ladders as most are largeconclusion  with aid of a great story line to go through the game is very addictive after phantasy star online if you love a typical japanese style rpg then youll no doubt love this game
the game comes in two cds and it took me over  hours to get through the first one and im now onto the second one
if you only buy selective games then i hands down recommend that you purchase this game
im sure you can remedy the vast sceneries con with some music in the background or flicking to another channel as you hold the button downhee heecheers for reading my reviewskies of arcadia is one of the best games i have played all year and i own a psxone and a dreamcast and a pc
this is a true console rpg in every way and is influenced by many other rpgs to create a unique experience
unique
yes you get an airship from the start and the map is a series of floating islands with seperate cultures and architecture and music
the characters have very memorable design and the airships are spectacular
my fav part of the game is the airship battles which can be long but are way interesting to watch
the graphics are superb although not near the calibur as say resident evil code veronica or shenmue this is anime meets polygons and it is very well done
the voices arent bad at all since they are kept to a minimum to be used as battle cries and emotion indicators
the game truly is a good buy for a christmas present if your a parent it is good for  ages i would suspect with some language and character interaction that only mature users will pick up on
the story is very good and original unlike grandia  the battle system is very simple and the enemy random encounters can be a bit too often but your levels will increase quickly
i have spent  hours on it so far and i am on disc 
the game may be quicker to beat but i generally take my time and look around etc
to get the most out of my purchase
get this game and prepare for the sequel which is already in development
yes  it is in development as of ign newsmany will be turned off by persona  because this isnt a final fantasy type of game
persona  really isnt a game you can just take out of the box and play
although i finished both grandia  and skies of arcadia without opening up the instruction manual i had to read persona s manual cover to cover
the reason for a monster instruction manual is persona  is not a cookie cutter rpg
aside from the modern day setting and characters that swear like sailors there are some unique gameplay components like conversing with demons summoning and spreading rumors all of which arent very intuative
however once you get the hang of the game especially the battle system persona  is very fun and completely orginallove the game but the only downside was i order a new one and it was wrap in plastic and had a crack on the case and didnt have the security label on it and when i open it it had a finger print on the disc
if the company i got it from said used but like new i would have been ok with it
game good but now you can get it on the psn so do that than over pay for thisto sum it all up it aint that bad of a game
it just needed a little extra tender loving care from enix to make it the caliber of the topnotch squaresoft games
the good points innovative idea
youre a goddess and go around recruiting warriors called einherjar to fight the holy norse wars
the music is fairly good as well although it could have been been better
the bad points
the game unlike what the box says is not  hours
it is  tops i got through it in  getting the best ending in the process
the ending sequence the best one is extremely short
im talking like  minutes short followed by  minutes of credits
thats only  minutes
not worth sitting and playing the game through
what happened to the  minute endings of the super nintendo age final fantasy 
the kind that made you proud that you neglected your family girlfriend and hygiene
ah well
the story portions can become very boring and youll find yourself mashing buttons to get past the story and onto the more fun stuff like bashing in some vampires head
the game is a rental at best lock yourself in your room and play for the weekend you should beat it
the only reason anyone should own this game is either a you love norse mythology or b you must own every rpg the playstation releases or c its one of amazons specialsconsidering the huge debt that the fantasy genre owes to norse mythology one would think there would be more projects paying homage to this inspiring sourcethough valkyrie profile vp may have been alone in its norse roots we can be thankful for the unique concepts that it brought to the rpg table
in particular 
combatthe first thing that really drew me into vp was the unique combat system
turnbased yes but mashing the controller buttons and watching all four of your swordswinging characters rush a single enemy before unleashing up to four separate special attacksto include swords that wreak explosive destructionis utterly thrilling to watchwhile this style of combat does encourage more buttonmashing than most other rpgs there is still a lot of strategy involved especially when magicusers are in your ranks
i especially found their wait reaction attack invaluable for catching enemies off guard before sending my swordwielders in to take down foesas with most all rpgs since there is a lot of combat its a good thing they got it rightgraphicsi usually dont mention graphics so early on in a review but the graphics for this game are really good
not only are there cgi scenes but there are also cartoons reminiscent of the lunar games
even more impressive is when cgi magic attacks are seamlessly incorporated into the battles you fightfinally i was thrilled at the actionfigure size of the characters
this made the characters seem larger than life especially characters like arngrim who carry an equally massive swordeven without a bigscreen tv you should have no problem seeing the action on the screenmusicin an earlier review of mine which can be found herevalkyrie profile i remarked on how odd it was for an oriental composer doing the soundtrack for a game steeped in norse mythology
a lot could have gone wrong here and yes there is a lot of blah on the soundtrack but there are also quite a few masterpieces of video game music to be found
examples would be the song behave irrationally or some of the boss battle tunesanother plus is that all the tracks can be listened to within the game via a special soundroomgameplayas the title of my review states this game is both daunting and full of depthits daunting in that there are  endings but the best of these is practically unattainable without a walkthrough which is what i resorted to after attempting this game two or three times without one
honestly i dont know how the developers expected someone to attain this a ending using primarily trial and error
and to be honest i didnt find the a ending all that impressive either especially when compared to other great rpg endings the minute ending of final fantasy  or the extended endgame quests of lunar  eternal blueas for depth this game has it in spades
there is a huge character pool to select from even after some of these warriors are sent to valhalla
tons of spells items weapons armor trinkets artifacts 
you name it
not only that but you can transmutate some of these items into other items or cash them in for mp which is the magical money that one uses
characters can learn a huge list of abilities raise individual stats or even allocate points to make them a better warrior one more fit for the army of lord odinall the dungeons and enemies within are pretty unique
however the towns unique as they are serve very little purpose in the grand scheme of thingsbut perhaps most unique about vp is the concept of your main character valkyrie harvesting worthy souls for odin to use in ragnarok the end of the world
you could argue that you are still being led from towntotown like most other rpgs but in my opinion this game leads one charactertocharacterconsapart from the brutal difficulty and learning curve of this game the only other negative things i have to say are rather nitpicky in nature
for one figuring out which items to create for your characters is often a matter of trial and error
expect to create lots of things like chainmail only to find out that character x cant equip it
doh
creation costs offer a slight clue as to what the best equipment is but this is not always a reliable rule to followoverallalthough i think this is a good game with a few flaws if nothing else valkyrie profile should be praised for drawing from norse mythology and doing a great job of capturing its essence
ive found that this game is one of those that you may struggle to get involved with but no matter how many times you put it off to the side it always seems to call back to you begging to be playedit is no surprising to see such innovative battle system from this title
after all it is from triace
being a faithful to triace i wasnt disappointed to see thiswhat surprised me is that they combined norse mythology into rpg to create something unique
there are no hero to save world
there are no love story not conventional one anyway to deal with
you are just a middlemen to fulfill your duty as a battlemaid
with all conventional ideas thrown out it still gives sense of comfort for rpgers to easily pickup and play this beautiful game
with hand drawn scenery to enchanting score this is amazing titlei just love itthis game is obviously from famous shooter developer psikyo with capcom characters
i always liked psikyo games especially  series with its challenging game play with psikyo trade mark game formula along with vibrant graphicthe most absurd thing about any shooter game if i have to point out is infinite continues
whats the point of playing a well made game in one seating
however this game does offer controlled infinite continues
from level  you will have to start from the start of the level you died from not from the spot you died at
however it can be manipulated if you are playing with a friend and as long as one is on the screen the other player can continue nowthats a cheating
graphic seems decent throughout the game but it seems somewhat outdated with cartoonish charactersthe only complain i have is that certain enemy attacks are not there to test your reflex but rather too overwhelming
yes its possible to finish the game with one continue but its really hard to pull that off and knowing what spot at when becomes crucial
i would prefer limited continue system over controlled continue system like this game
however owning this arcade perfect shooter and another psikyo game with this admission is well worth your money
where shooters are being way underrated this game does hold its own place with good qualities
give it a try as a gamer who despises the split screen form of multiplayer gaming power stone  was a great alternative
after being addicted to the first power stone for a long time the next seemed like a sure thingthe fighting in this game is incredibly simple
there are a group of  types of moves which are all the same for each character including punching kicking picking up and throwing
in addition each character has a super move than can be done after collecting three power stones which is unique for each character
although this gameplay is incredibly simple it is really addictive when playing with friends
all this was included in the first installmentthis second installment adds a whole new level to the gameplay  four player matches
each player attacks all the others or you can work in teams cooperatively or against the cpu
this ads a whole new flavor especialy when you and  friends take to the fightthe arenas are huge and fully interactive with tons of things to throw and weapons to pick up and use
new weapons can also be created by combining different ones you have picked up during gameplay
poles are everywhere that you can swing around and do more damage to your enemy as well as a few vehicles of mass destruction
often levels change as you fight such as an aircraft carrier that explodes and the fighing is continued as you plummet to the ground and then mayhem ensues as the battle is taken to land
another level features two submarines you fight on top of as they each submerge and return to the surface until thay reach land and the battle continues on an icebergthis game is a great addictive fighting game with simple controls any newbie can pick up easily and have a lot of fun withokay i never really liked the first power stone
the only thing i liked about it was the gameplay and the graphics but the only thing i hated about it was the short enviroments
when power stone  came out ive heard how it had a long replay value so i said to myself quothey 
lets get this sucker quot
when i popped it into my dreamcast i was thoroughly amazed by not only the graphics and gameplay but its huge enviroments
these levels are so freakin huge it has already beaten the interactive enviroments of super smash bros 
you get to ride on tanks shoot a gatling gun run from a huge boulder use a submarines missile launchers my favorite part and fight two different
bosses as huge as a giant mech
sad thing is theres only a short variety of levels and only three new characters two more characters and a few levels to unlocktoo bad you cant play as the two bosses
if youre looking for a multiplayer game i pick this one up if i were you say what you will about capcoms sequal making past look
street fighter  alpha plus omega edition  squared
 they got just about everything right with power stone taking a cue from the possibly overhyped dead or alive  power stone  brings levelinteractivity in a fighting game to new heights
using a  perspective view one can do more than strafe around an enemy or hop over them
one can do a lot more
such as what you ask
well how about hopping into gun turrets on submarines before they submerge and blasting away
or how about uprooting a pole from the ground and making a home run with the nearest enemy
anyway a whole new level of interactivitypower stone  also has something for the unlocking crowd out there an item buying and mixing mode
by playing through the game in quotadventurequot mode you accumulate items which can be then sold at the item shop
more importantly however is the fact that you can mix them together and create new neverbeforeseen items
you could do this for days
weeksdishing out the damage against three opponents is entertaining and leads to some good strategy in what is otherwise a very simplistic combat engine
and its a good thing that the combat is simple sometimes its hard enough just trying to figure out where your damn character is after theyve been swatted with a tennis racquetand that is my only real problem with the game sometimes its hard to figure out what the heck is going on
well that and the occasional cheap shot from one of the bosses
certainly nothing to cry abouthowever with entertaining characters great gameplay and an item costing  creditswhich you will never have this game will stay in the dreamcast for a long time
certainly a great purchasei would recommend that you go get a dreamcast just for powerstone 
this game recently destroyed a party with friends because of its simplicity and appeal
eri mean destroyed in a good way
if you have the friends or family and yes unlike ps you can play this one with mom or little jimmy around then go get it
the multi player is beyond description
the single player mode is kinda flat and leaves you feeling short changed but to make up for that to can play a mayhem match with the cpu controlling the other  characters or collect rare weapons while you try to fight in adventure modethe basic rundownpros multi player rocks
 even on a rainy day with no friends around you can still enjoy a mayhem match the graphics are awesome the backrounds are even bigger and badder the sheer amount of weapons to find or create by mixing existing weapons is awesome two players can team up to go through the game rogue is seriously toned down to family friendly standards good move no more one trick pony victories you gotta fight for a win here fighting engine was reworked to make the game more fun and it worked adventure mode adds replay value to the single player experience new characters especially accel are a welcome addition japenese voices are left intactso why not  stars with so many pros
read oncons no character personality or good story or character endings small number of stages less than ps and stages do not reflect any character in particular single player mode limited except for adventure mode the final boss is a waste of game memory and resources
the final boss is pathetic and demonically ugly
the other shortcomings could be over looked but this freak is sickening
my spirit is disturbed every time i see him
we could have seen a better final boss one with style and a rad multi level backround
this brought down the score more than anything else no powerstone  for dreamcastoverallget this game and a second hand dreamcast it is worth it
buy a dreamcast at amazon now games this fun that are not sports titles arent made anymorethe power stone series is best described as a hybrid of the fighting and platform genres
while still at its heart a fighting game power stone  introduces many other elements which deviate from your traditional fighter
the gameplay is completely dimensionalyou can jump up platforms climb on walls pick up a variety of different weapons and even use vehicles such as tanks and gun turrets to dispose of opponents
perhaps the best feature of all is the multiplayer battles
even though the action can get quite chaotic its still fun to blast each other around the incredibly colorful and detailed arenas
the arcade mode should have been just a little longer and unfortunately the simple controls dont allow for much strategybut as a multiplayer party game that anyone can jump into power stone  is one of the best
if you are a hardcore fighting game fan you may be turned off by the cheap gameplay but its great to have if for those times when youre in the mood for something a little less stessfuli can honestly say that i did not have a bad time playing resident evil survivor
although im a fan of survivalhorror im a big fan of firstperson shooters and i have been for years
i can understand why resident evil fans bh about how this game sucks its not as awesome as the other resident evilsexcept gaiden the creepy vibe is absent most of the time the voiceacting and story are more cheesy as well and the graphics actually look worse than the other resident evil games on psone
the game takes place after the events of resident evil  nemesis on an island where apparently the infection had been brought to that was outside raccoon city where the infection started
you are a soldier and during a flight on a helicopter a scientist was clinging to the bars on the chopper and he shoots down your flight
it turns out you are the only survivor and youve lost your memory gasp
so you shoot your way through hell while discovering the secrets of your past
the shooting mechanics actually use the same buttons the other resident evil games use on psone hold down r to aim and press x to fire except trying to shoot something is not haphazard
the creatures are still gross freaky and nasty and the game feels like an arcade game think house of the dead carnevil and time crisis combined plus you never run out of ammo and you will laugh at the lame story and voiceacting
still this game while having better controls than the other resident evil games it just isnt as fun as the others and it feels like it has more thrills than scares
damn this was a good christmas
especially with getting games like this one resident evil directors cut resident evil  resident evil  nemesis resident evil gaiden parasite eve    final fantasy vii xiii the punisher and mercenaries which will keep me busy for awhile and ill get to amazon eventually to say if they are good so far so good though really good in facti really did like this game a lot of ppl did not but its a great classic re game and really funat first i did not like it so much but as i played on it got better an better if u have not played this case of the bad reviews i say give it a try a real fan of re will like it the game play is good the story is ok and it uses the re zombies and mr x an the final boss looks like the tyrant from re  fans if you havent played this u have to play it real good underrated gameresident evil is the greatest survival horror series ever no doubt
what you may not know is that the first resident evil game was originally intended as a first person shooter ala doomthat didnt happen thank goodness
but capcom did make a fps resident evil game and this is it
this is the first in the gun survivor series followed by resident evil dead aim dino stalker and code veronica  a europe only game that has no bearing on the overall plotthis is a canon game in the series
the events are mentioned in the opening of resident evil zero on gamecubethe graphics are nice because they are from the golden age of playstation and follow in the tradition of resident evil  and  many complain about this game but it really is not so bad
its not a shooter as good as goldeneye for nintendo  of course but its not too shabby in its own rightthe locations are nice and it has that special playstation charm to it gotta love it
the only reason this doesnt get  stars is because of no light gun supportthis game does use a lightgun unlike amazon reckonfirst off the graphics are pretty nice the best of the type on the playstation and the zombies look move and die better than in the other light gun games on the console
to say that the graphics are poor is wrong youd have to miss all of the nuances of them like the flesh dripping off the zombies or all of the other resie touches in the gamethe gameplay is a pretty standard affair for lightgun games during combat but bnothing short of revolutionary when moving
you point at the screen and click the trigger to kill the enemies normal but to move instead of using a controller you point off the screen in the direction you want tom move and hold the trigger
great and really adds to the atmosphere as unlike the other resies you can only see whats infront of youthere is a problem though with this method as the ai in the gamne is not exactly top notch and this means that the hardest enemies in the game the bosses can be beaten with relative ease
well nopethere is a bit of replay value in there though with the premise of different endings and to pick up all of the documents within the game and so see the whole story
much like almost every  other resie game  survival horror game on the marketim a die hard resident evil fanatic and well the game itself i enjoyed itthe controls are very bad in the game the graphics are lacking compared to the other playstation one resident evil gamesbut i did like the story line and the fact that the name says it all survivorwhat i mean above is the fact that there are no save points it makes it more of a challenge and you have to think ahead with all of your itemsthere are a limited amount of continues but overall its a fun game and the story line is goodthis was my first ps gamei bought it two weeks before i even got my ps
i remember looking at the super hires graphics in the pics it both looked more impressive than it was and i never played a dreamcast by this point and practically dreaming about it
while my every hope and dream wasnt met with the revolutionary game i was expecting this game was a nice unique adventure that i still occasionally play todaythis game was imo easily better than evergrace eternal ring and even summoner the other three launch ps games and i liked it more than some that have come out since
the game isnt stupid like many people say it was just shrouded in a large number of bad decisions for the overall production
the graphics were nice the battle system inventive the plot decent and the voice acting goodthe games story involves a timelapse in which orphen is shot into a time and particular story and when its over he is shot back to the begining only to play through another
while remembering that something is odd between times he goes back and starts over his memory of those he met the places hes been or the searching for the artifact called the crystal egg which can control time soon no longer exist and similar plot twists occur in the three scenarioswhile not as linear as final fantasy x its also nowhere near as epic nor does it make as much sense
really the plot while with some nice original moments really seems like an excuse to have a game starring the decently famous character the sorcerous stabber orphen
the ending is pretty weak despite the gorgeous music during the big endcredit sequence there are two kinds of end credit sequences and the writting of some scenes is simply terrible
not to mention there are just too many parts where something just happens to go wrong or right and as such things happen the way they dowhich is sometimes the way they just happened only now again but ever so slightly different
however due to the games shortness about  hours altogether if you can tolerate a chunk of cheezy lines and repeditive or silly sequences this game isnt much to bearthe voice work during the cutscenes is great however
sure theyre all very very annoying but its because the original writers only partially understood the true character of the orphen anime saga
the voices are full of life energy emotion and quinton flynn being chosen to play orphens role was one of the most brilliant moments of gamevoice casting ever
the character movement during the game isnt anywhere as nicethe big thing about it is that when a character is knocked over the common thing for them to do isnt to stand back up but to reversefall
moments of almost unbearable tackiness start to clutter up any feelings of reality the game offersthe game is apart from the now outdated graphics and terrible movement a rather believable and entertaining fantasy epic
this mostly comes because the ways the graphics are handled
the polygon counts in almost every other launch title was higher than in this but the colors are vibrant saturated and glowing as well as the lighting very truetolife and the art direction rather decent
the monster battles are very cinematic in feel as unless hit by an attack no enemy or ally hp display is projected onto the screen while the camera follows the action very flashily full of rapid cameracuts fast motion and tons of flying effects
and my favorite graphical touch by far the sun when looked upon shines that great line of light that just barely misses hitting your eye perpendictularly like in the moviesa great zenith nice color temperature and nice shadow work tootruthfully while i love this game i do not recommend it to anyone except the most patient of gamers
however since it has so many of my memories in it and its well acted out and well colored and that im trying to write an orphen movie inspired to be a sequel to the series i know im going to be playing this game for years to comedespite that i know its just me
i really wish that they would either remake this title or create another orphen game sequel or sidestory since this game had shining potential and nice imagination
if only the testers were able to mouth opinions as well as say simply yup when i hit the square i jumpevery aspect of this game was improved a truckload since bof namely playing the game isnt painful anymore
im a huge fan of the series played it since the first loved them all even if after  hours or so the game got repetetive but this game still lacks in several ways control isless than stellar
poor camera angles rigid movement  principle directions not free range like ff series games and awkward speed changes make it hard to move exactly where you need to be to read that dang sign graphics  the sprite animation is incredible but the d graphics this game posesses just hurt my feelings
if square can make leaps and bounds you can too capcom fishing  capcom made this way too hard in this game
they kinda perfected the system in bof and then decided to butcher it again for  i supposeon the bright side the game has several plusses all the mini games are really fun worth your time and actually beneficial towards the flow of the game
thank god the music and plot get increasingly more complex linear and sensical as the series progresses you can skip the animation sequences for long spells
square take notes
this makes the game so much less painful to playwell now yet another breath of fire i have to say i was a little dissapointed with this one for one the battle system is kinda lame compared to breath of fire  except for the dragons they were designed pretty well except for the aura and astral dragons thier design sucked
but other than that i guess the game was alrightwhen i bought bof iv on its release i was thoroughly unimpressed with the simple plot and rather poor graphicshowever being as i am temporarily broke with the prospect of any new ps  games being but a distant horizonblip i decided to give it another go and i have to say i am delighted i didbof iv is not a game about technical bedazzlement or complicated quests with much philosophising
it is not a final fantasy game
nor in fifteen years time will it be remembered as a classic like the final fantasies
but its still an excellent homage to the early days of rpgs like shining wisdom the original zelda and the legend of oasis gamesbriefly the plot cray and princess nina are investigating the disappearance of ninas sister elina when they run across ryu a strange boy with no past and no direction
their quest to find elina and give ryu a life takes them across several continents accumulating a cast of memorable characters and unravelling a plot that involves dragons civil war and theological entitieswhat i am most impressed with is the simplicity and clarity with which bof iv plays
stylishly retro the graphics are actually rather good  with more frames of animation and bigger brighter characters than before  and some lovely spell effects
everything is drawn in realtime and the option to rotate the camera a full  degrees compensates much for the lousy camera angles one often runs acrossthe control system too is very easy to get to grips with and userfriendly  spells and abilities are learned and interchangeable  and the combo system is a nice innovative touchthe characters are decent wellthought out personalities but lack diversity
so far so goodsadly bof iv like onimusha after it is just a little too far entrenched on the side of mundane to be a truly memorable classic
it does take a good three or four hours of play time before the plot and characterisation picks up and by this time you may well be unable to forgive the game its rather uninspiring opening
similarly confusing and dull are the playable early sections starring foulu the laguna loire to ryos squall
like the rest of the game thankfully these sections get progressively better and by the end youll have formed an affectionate attachment to bof ivall in all an excellent little title with one or two sadly fatal flaws that keep it from being a classic bof iv is a definite reccommendation if you can get it cheapcapcoms breath of fire rpg series has not stood the test of time all that well and no new installments have been offered in almost a decade
but personally i really like this one in particular
the story characters spells abilities etc
are all fairly runofthemill jrpg fare
at the same time they are presented in a way that made me forget just how conventional it was
characters are colorful and the d sprites are animated fluidly  even if their animation is a tad limited
the sound is also a bit limited but the quality is good
the music is also a very strong point of the game and it certainly adds significant depth to the whole of the game
the battle system is the same as it ever was and just as good as it ever was so no complaints there
besides the faulty camera and occasionally awkward field controls there really is not too much worth complaining about if you dont mind the overall lack of originality  and the fact that its pretty easy
but its fun from the getgo and kept me interested for the roughly  hours it took me to finish the game and i barely touched the sidequests so i missed out on a lot
nothing to write home about but recommendedin the modern day of  hour rpg quests and multipleinputcommand d fighting games its a rare thing to see a new release game that tests reflexes while being fun
thank you capcom for cannon spike
this game reminds me of the old arcade shooter days playing galaga and gyruss for hours just to get a higher score
unlike your resident evils or final fantasies theres not much of a story here
robots invade must kill robots
the shooting begins
you control a character several are from capcom classics like arthur from ghosts n goblins who zips around the screen laying waste to anything that moves
you fight a subboss then move to another part of the stage then fight a real boss using various weapons and spectacular powerups mega man rolls around the screen damaging anything he touches to save the day
the graphics are definitely modern from the nice character animation to the convincing explosions and gorgeous arenas in the slope you run circles around a robot skier as you both careen down an icy mountain
the twoplayer mode can be used as a coop effort or a mad competition for points and health powerups
completing the game opens a cool capcom art gallery with conceptual sketches and other cannon spike stuff
gamers used to d actionadventures wont find a lot to satisfy them here but to me theres nothing like taking a break from soul reaver or code veronica to blow the heck out of robots with names like bio gorilla bloody or flying saucer kabuki
length and depth take a back seat to oldfashioned fun with cannon spike and i find it to be a refreshing changei loved this game
it is super fun and just difficult enough to be challenging but not so bad that you are frustrated and stuck
the dinos are wicked fun and unnerving
i love regina she is awesome
thumbs upi actually liked the sequel much better than the firstthe raptors are one tough breed of dinosaur you have to be smart to survive those bastardsanother is i love the fact you can buy weapons and ammunition with the extinct points you accmulate throughout the game watch out for gigantosaurus his roar will literally knock you on your buttocks trust medino crisis the original was an ok
resident evil style game with dinos thrown in for funwell dino crisis  breaks the mold of the resident evil game play style and implements a tremendously addicting new way to kill dinos
more of an arcade tomb raider shooter dc really brings home the feeling of quotwalking with dinosaursquot
there are more than  different types of dinos most of them very familiar some are from jurassic parkgame play is very easy ive only played the normal difficulty so far yet extremely entertaining
each dead dinosaur is worth a number of quotpointsquot
kill a few dinos in a row and build up combo points
kill a dino when its attacking and receive a counter multiplier
all the points you collect are used to buy better weapons ammo tools and health items
since your able to hold two weapons at a time in dc getting better weapons with more points is a very important part of the gameoverall dc is far better than the original dino crisis yet creates a new type of survival horror quotblastadinoquot horrordino crisis was an excellent game but dino crisis  blew it out of the water
in this game you are able to battle more dinos with more weapons and in more environments
this game also includes a buying system similar to that of blue stinger
it takes it to a whole new levelas a big fan of kart racing games ill buy just about any of them
muppet race mania is pretty standard for the genre but it does a good job of standing apart from the pack with its colorful courses based on the muppet movies and of course the fun characters of the muppets themselvesthe real treat here is stunt mode which forces you to navigate some really tricky obstacle courses in loony muppet settings
these courses are more about controlling your kart than racing against time and there are lots of clever contraptions to help you along the way
its harder than it sounds
some of the stunt courses took me a loooooong time to complete
its an innovative feature that makes this game worth getting even if you already own other kart gamesand its a total bargain too
how can you go wrongthe ps one is the microversion of the full system with the same power functions and vast library of games
to give you an idea of how small it is it is about  of the size of the older system i was quite suprised at how small it was
it is almost as small as a portable cd playerthe big advantage with the ps one as opposed to the older model is the fact that it can be easily transported so if you are off to a friends house on a trip or need something to keep the kids occupied during the long road trip this is essential
all the old playstation games work with this console and it also plays any audio cd
the dual shock analog controller makes controlling the games those that support the analog controls easy and stressfree
the memory cards go into the usual slots
the only thing that the ps one system lacks is a reset button so you have to turn the power on and off to restart a gameif you are lucky enough the have the lcd screen you have a portable system
you can take it anywhere and enjoy all your favorite games while on the road or at least enjoy the quiet while the kids are busy with it
like older systems the ps one is carrying on the tradition of being redesigned with space saving in mind
remeber the old nes and snes
just before they were discontinued they would redesigned in sleeker smaller systems
the ps one is now very inexpensive so there is almost no excuse for not having onewith a vast solid library of games the ps one is a sound investment
believe it or not it wasnt until september  that i ditched my old snes under duress i might add and bought a playstation
a lot of the games are classic and can suit amost any taste
well worth buyingi do not own a psone but i played it at my friends house for a long time
i must say that it is a very good system considering the price and games
the graphics are really bad but gameplay is all that matters with older systems
it truly is a great system but not when it is compared to segas dreamcast
the controller is good and so are some of the games
but sony is about to pull the plug of the psone
but hey for fifty bucks you cant go wrong with the psone unless of course you want a  bit cansole for the same price tagi hope that this review was helpful to youif you are a big fan of sony productsi suggest you buy this only if you dont have a psit has a wide library of gamesbut they lack gameplay from other console gamesmost people prefer the playstations over nintendosthey are very wrongwhile playstation has more gamesthey dont spend much time on themthe playstation lacks soundgraphicsand gameplay that other systems can offer youyou can also buy this if you want a stereobecause it will play audio cdsyou must buy an adapter for you to have  controller socketsim selling mine with  controllersa memory cardand  gamesit will be in the used section of this pagealthough you might be on the second pageim selling it because i would like to get an xboxi have a gamecubenintendo dreamcastgameboygameboy colorand a gameboy advance and duha playstationif you like a system with tons of games and an overall gameplayand also is inexpensivei would buy thisi recentley got ps its better then n and dreamcastbut my gamecubes betteri suggest ff with itactually not worth plugging in to the tv some of the time but i like keeping it around for a rainy dayokay first off the psone is a great system it always has been
its the exact same as the original playstation and so many people dont understand that
quotliquid clear displayquot
its liquid crystal display
the most technologically advanced system
even more so than ps or xbox
yeah right
buy some new eyes
and it has no games
none really come out anymore the system is  years old but there are hundreds and hundreds of games out for it
no nothings make me mad
it loads faster
no
better graphics
nofrom a kids review also the playstation  is the first console to use discs rather then cartridges and to be able to play cdspcs may have used discs but ps is the first console
d is the first discbased console by about  years
and it could easily play cds as well
i know i tried it
actually when it came down to it perhaps playstation had better quality discs but as far as reliability went do far outstripped the playstations
playstation  on average will quit after a few months
playstation one may be better since they dont take their customers for granted as much
however this is yet another example of how crummy products outshine decent ones
do went out of business because the stuff was too expensive to make for what they were making from the games and because playstation beat it at salesthis game system is not the psx psx is sonys latest system and will be released in japan this year
however the ps has half decent graphicsthe sound is all the same to me and a large selection  of kick ass games
its cons are some games may give you a headach and its outdated
other than that its very goodaccording to the graphicssound and size its a gamers systemit has a big library of games and between the games it has d graphicsthis system is worth the moneyvery well worth the moneyignore the negative comments in any review of this game
more care went into creating it than into some of the original series episodesscooby and the gang havea mystery to solve
there are scooby snacks train chases clues and villians
what else can you ask forthis game is a lot like a putt putt or freddy fish game
if you like those or like scooby doo youll like this game
ps you should be under  years old but whos countinglook it may not be the best pc game but over all this is a lot of funmy niece age   and i play together and we have a great time
the screen images are very crisp and clear
there are all sorts of clues that you need to find and the more we play the more clues my niece remembers
she gets a big huge grin on her face when she remembers what we need to do nextshes really into trains right now and there is a very cool train ride where scooby and shaggy are being chased by quotthe bad guyquotthe sounds are fun and come on its scooby
oh and the best part is the only time you see scrappy is when you go to the menu screenjanes world war ii fighters is a great game
it includes  planes   from the allies usa and britain and of course  from the axis germany only
all of these planes are a joy to fly once you get used to their diverse handling methods
all aspects of the game are high quality and really give you the feeling that you are in the cockpit of a world war ii era plane
after all thats what sims are forthe game is really fun to play
it offers a little something for everyoneif you are a flight sim fanatic you can turn realism settings on high
if you are an arcade fan you can turn them down
the game also offers training missions which include such things as how to take off how to land how to dive bombetc
theyre really helpful
also there are a bunch of play modes
single mission  which lets you pick preexisting missions
my favorite was an allied mission in which you were a german fighter who realized germany was going to be beaten so you steal a me  and fly it to an allied basewith two other s on your tail
anyway campaign  lets you fly in a campaign for either the allies or the axis powerswhich is really fun
the only problem with that is that you dont get to pick a particular plane and fly it every timefor instance i really suck with a pjand id like to fly a mustang every mission if for nothing more than the fact that id get really good with it
mission builder  is pretty fun but it takes a while to get used to
the readme on triggers is really helpful for that though
quick mission  lets you pick what plane you want to fly in how many wingman you have how many enemies you have and you can even have axis fighters versus axis
its pretty cool seeing s fight each other time of day weapon loadout and many other things
overall great gameplaythe graphics are good but on my system i experience a lot of slowdowneven with a lot of features turned down or off like d clouds detail etc
that would be so bad but with the system im playing oni expect a smooth framerate
that only occurs when a whole lot is going on though like  planes on your side tanks on both sides and enemy fightersall doing their own thingthe graphics quality is excellentwhen i was flying a night mission i just couldnt believe it was a game and not a movie i was playing
it looked so good in fact i could see the moon glimmering off of the paint of my fockewulf
amazing
like i said graphics are amazing i just wish the frame rate was a little betteroverall i would recommend this game to most people interested in the flight genre
be forewarned however if you are playing this game with a logitech wingman force you may experience some problems with the controls
for instance sometimes the force feedback will just turn off after a mission is over
other times it will occur when you go to the main menu and then come back into your game
however this only happened every so often and really didnt interfere with my enjoyment of the game too much
however it was significant enough to knock a star off of the review for itjanes  wwii fighters is another great janes game
the game features  missions both axis allies
there is also a mission editor and fun internetlan play
the graphics in the game is simple great
you can see the bullet holes in the airplane d clouds fire and smoke ect
the graphics are very smooth and excellent lighting effects
the game as very good damage effects
but there could have made the cities or towns denser or in a greater detail
there is a great amount of airplanes p mustang pd thunderbolt pj lightning supermarine spitfire mk
ix bf g fwa and me a
the gameplay is pretty good the areas such as the ai are pretty good
the lay out of the airplane is a weaker area of the game
its very annoying you cant see the gages very  well
but you use a popup tool to see them better
the weakest area of the game is the realism part of it
the auto pilot will fly around and shoot at enemy
all so in air to air combat you cant run into each other
the all so doesnt give you the feeling that youre dog fighting at  feet in the air
over all i would have to say that you should give this game a try
for the money  or you can aim for microsoft combat simulatorthis sim came out in  and given the dearth of simulationgames devoted to wwii since then its still a nearcutting edge gamethough its title makes it sound similar to other janes fighters games like atf or usnf   and despite similar gameplay  the sound graphics and organization of jwwf put the game in a class by itself
you can probably guess the premise  fly single missions campaigns or instant action in your choice of many wwii planes like the mustang me or spitfire
if youve made short work of your computers flying abilities go online though by the time you read this janes multiplayer support will be long dead and flame your best friends
the airplanes exteriors look gorgeous  nowhere near as cartoonish as those on atfusnf
the interiors look pretty good to really conveying the feeling of being inside a likely freezing p flying against camouflaged panzer tanks during the battle of the bulge
if the effect isnt exactly spectacular its still an achievement considering that the interiors  like those on usnfatf  are really eyecandy you can turn them on and off so theyre really extraneous
despite their being unneccessary ea deisgners decided against making the panels and frames of your cockpit look flat and unconvincing
get a hit on your engine and your plane will vibrate or spew oil  and boy will you notice that
damage is also beefed up since atfusnf days with damaged airplanes more prone to snap in two if forced to fly at the edge of their limits than undamaged airplanes
different airplanes will fly different ways  i was able to outfly speedy me fighters as long as i could keep from flying the highspeed vertical maneauvers they favored
the tactic is harder to use against the me the nazis early jet which will attack in pairs the trick is to anticipate which of the jets is just leading you on and which is really about to attack but not impossible
if the sim has some realism flaws mind you im no pilot some are likely unavoidable  like the fact that air combat was never a pure fighter war for the allies over europe it may have been the germans contended on the other hand with bombers  both light and medium  tactical attack planes recon fighters and other support craft the me itself was never really contemplated as a fighter to fight other fighters its acceleration and wingloading made it best only for flying past escort screens and for being able to engage more waves of enemy bombers than older fighters
velocity is modeled very well as are the vaporous effects of clouds at different levels and the fluidity of fire from stricken planes i mostly saw my own
ground detail was dissappointing but this isnt a sim committed to lowlevel attack so i was willing to overlook that
in short sound and graphics make this a still superlative sim  not as demanding as ubisofts il
while you wont be able to import rd party airplanes or missions as you may with microsofts cfs series janes offers more out of the box than that other gameperformance  i ran this game with little problem on my pentium iv ghz system using winxp and a geforce card
if youre looking for a great wwii game but feel intimidated by il and have heard some bad news re janes attack squadron id consider getting this gameso far this seems to be a good program
im still learning it and my experiance of it impresses mesystem shock ii was a sequel that came out of nowhere and hit the gaming  community like a bolt of lightning
it was one of the first st person  shooter games that combined the usual tactics and traits of a shooter game  with roleplay elements
your goal isnt just to kill every monster in  sight but also to solve a mystery on the shipanother interesting  aspect is that you can set up your own skills and traits either as a  fighter a computer wiz or a psychic
each skill will get your through  the obstacles in different ways and as you progress your prowess grows in  whatever areas you choosethe atmosphere is wonderful
as you sneak  thorugh the darkened corridors there are sounds and bits of ambiance all  around you
zombies gibber as they hunt you down monkeys chatter as they  prowl through the ships cyborgs politely ask you to come out so they can  explode in your face steam hisses from vents computers humm softly
this game has the hairs on my neck standing up half the time or threw me  into wild fits as i tried to get myself out of a suprise attackthe only  downsides to the game were the monster respawning after you had cleared  out a level and the rapid degredation of guns while you used them but  there is a game patch that very nicely handles this problem and also allows  you to play cooperative multiplayer if you desireall in all this game  is very much worth the price
if you want a nice shooter game with enough  atmosphere and history to make it seem real then this is the perfect game  for youseveral things make this hybred shooter  rpg hard first there arent large piles of ammo available and most monsters only drop one bullet shell etc
youll almost always be short of ammo needing to resort to the default weapon a wrench especially on the early levels
you really will need to make every shot count
additionally unlike most low ammo shooters this game while having some stealth elements is not stealth game
you sneak around some but there is the occasional large firefight you cant avoid
the last hard part is the slow rate that you acquire weapons and even after you find them you cant carry them all
itll take a long time to find and gain the skills to use better weapons and the limited inventory space means youll be making some hard choicesnot just a shooter you find cybernetic modules that you use to upgrade your abilities
upgrades include the usual statistics strength agility endurance etc weapon skills psonic abilities and technical skills
the technical skills are the most important you have repair and modify your weapons research unknown items you find and hack into computers security systems and other items
this hacking skill is most important skill you have
you wont enough modules for all the upgrades so choose wiselyaside from difficulty and rpg features the game provides a good story
your path is fairly linear and theres a bit too much key collecting there are a couple plot twists
and while the space ship interior graphics are mundane the sound design is excellent
youll need a good speaker setup to hear things coming up behind you or in the distance aheadone disappointment most monsters respawn
my preference has been to clear out an area and have it stay clearedi had no problems running this game on windows  although switching to the desktop caused a nvidiabased blue screen of deaththis a fun adventure
i am new to adventure games and this was good
the puzzles were not too hard to figure out
i did have to cheat a little bitthis would be your average point and click game if it werent for the compelling story and the great characters
this game takes some getting used to and i nearly gave up playing after half an hour
im glad i kept going thoughthe seven different stories are worthy of a good short stories book
the graphics look a little outdated but they do a great job at reproducing the atmosphere of an creepy abandoned amusement park
the voices are more than acceptable better than most dreamcatcher games and the musical score is fantastici agree it can be difficult at some points but its always up to you to decide how long you want to spend figuring out a puzzle
walkthroughs are all over the internetthis game rates lower than quotthe longest journeyquot but only because the latter was such a grandiose game
quotseven games of the soulquot is definitely in my top ten for adventure games
its the kind of game you are sad to finish because you know you are going to miss the charactersthe first time i played this game i found it pretty strange and pretty much rushed through it but i recently purchased it again on my ps
it has pretty good music storyline and graphics for its time
i gave it only  stars in my earlier review but now that i play it again i find it quite fun
sure the characters are pretty strange not human but theres alot of side games and quests that make it quite fun
the card game sucks sometimes cuz its all about luck but you can still get it down somewhat
this game is pretty fun if you have the patience to enjoy it
if you take your time and buy all the cheaper weapons you can get alot better weapons armor items at the synth shopsthis game is when squaresoft started getting better
its got much better gameplay than ff
but the charecters are worse
overall its a good game that i think people should buy
they continued the dumb card game i dont know why they did thatstrangely the practically universallyloathed final fantasy viii is probably my favorite of the series although i cant tell you why that would be
ix came soon right after and was released to not as much fanfare but it was just as anticipated with not only a return to more lighthearted fares and more brighter atmosphere and colors but was now in spirit to the nessnes days of the series with many references
of course that also meant that several elements feltborrowed to say the least so ix is one of those titles that is a pretty fun play and quite memorable but maybe we just expect too much of the series since ix is kind of flawed but still entertaining to a degreestory zidane is part of the tantalus group a band of thieves who are planning to sneak into alexandria castle and kidnap princess garnet
thing is however is that garnet wants to be kidnapped with worries of her mother queen brahne and her recent erratic behavior
the group escapes and soon get caught in a huge battle with several kingdoms in turmoil thanks to brahne and a strange man seen recently in the castlegraphics in many ways ix is ahead of viii for graphics although viii is more realistic ix just outshines it with more detailed and lush backgrounds diverse locales and more animated character movements
the fmvs are the definite highlight since theres a grander scope and theyre shot similar to hollywood productions with an eye on vista shots and exciting sequences
the world map as usual looks ugly while battle graphics are usable but not stellarsoundmusic ixs soundtrack is probably nobuo uematsus most profilic work with an excess of  tracks including a separate soundtrack for the music played in fmvs
this is a mixed bag of course since some music such as messenger of ruin the place ill return to someday melodies of life and frontier village dali are just as great as anything in his oeuvre while theres some decent tracks as well as functional unmemorable and downright awful
irony is he says this is his best soundtrack so ill let you be the judgegameplay the final fantasy series has always been similar to each other with the same battle commands levelling up and side quests available
but whats different is how you get stronger
similar to the esper system a piece of equipment you have  slots armor head body wrist and special can come with various abilities such as cure and fire for the mages beast killer for the attackers or support abilities like antibody and autolife
each ability has a number of ap for you to master which is received after fighting enemies
after getting the requisitive amount you can deequip the equipment and use it freely whereas if you take it off before you master you lose the ability until you reequip it againthe game is also littered with more sidequests with the big  being chocographs and tetra master
in the world there is the chocobo forest where you play a kind of hotandcold digging game digging up items with some being chocographs a visual clue to a treasure found somewhere in the world
find it and dig it up and you get better rewards
ive gotta say its quite an addicting game and although there are times where the accuracy of finding items is a bit too picky its still easy to be sucked in
as for tetra master its confusing at times its almost unfair and its just not as involving as triple triad
so naturally therell be a tournament thats required you beat to progress the story
just play cards from the start and build a collection and youll be finethe games difficulty is also a burden for some since at times its easy
personally at times its unbalanced since if you level up properly the game can be easy but the atb meter a meter fills whichll then allow you to select an action is way too slow and enemies can pack a wallop plus your phoenix downs give you a pathetic starting health so dont be surprised if theyre rekilled before you even get to cure them
but this isnt an rpg thatll make you rip your hair out but some will either find it way too easy or at times simply unfairis it the best in the series
probably not unless you particularly love this one
me i merely like it enough to finish it and be entertained by it but not enough to love iti got ff last xmasi love it
it has great graphics and is truely a great way to end the playstation era
since ps is in an all
the story was great the characters were great and the music was great
but still no ff tops ff yetwill the newest ff coming spring  top ff
ff and ff sure didnti was very glad that this game was not   i hated that game so much but anyways about ff ix
all in all it was a fairly decent rpg
the biggest drawback to this game is the characters
the only two characters i somewhat liked were vivi and amarant
zidane and dagger reminded me way too much of squall and rinoa from  yeck
quina was annoying
vivi was probably the only character that they spent time discussing and whatnot in fact he was basically forgotten after the nd disc
i just liked amarants quoti dont carequot attitude
the ability system was nice but i felt there werent enough crystals to allow total customization
important note  do not buy the strategy guide i bought it and was heavily disappointed as was everyone else according to the reviews   the story of this game was ok but it seemed to drag on kind of
that was ok though because i really like long games
i was trying to get everything and after completing the chocobo hot and cold quest at the end of the game at level  zidane everyone else was like  and under i had  hours i think
the chocobo game was definitely something new that i liked a lot and hope to see more of
the bad guy had traces of evil but seemed to lack just like ffs ultimecia
i really wished they would have made the crystal world a much bigger dungeon because it was very interesting
btw if you didnt know its basically a copy of the last part of ff ivs last dungeon p
some of the music was ok and the card game was interesting
in ff i avoided the card game like the plague and refused to collect the cards because i didnt even know how to play
i dont even understand the game now but ive gotten most of the cards  out of  and ive won most games lol
its a very interesting side quest indeed
so anyways check out this game its ok all in all
i wanted to give it  and a half starsi wouldntgo as far as to say ff is as good as the recent ff gamesor most of the games for that matter but it is still a great game
the atmosphere of this game is a far cry from ffs romantic adult atmosphere
everything is more comedic and cartoonish but the graphics are still up to par with recent rpgs but not very innovative
they basically look the same as ff or ff
anyway ill break this review downgraphics  like i said they are up to par with games of its time but are not very innovative
then again the playstation is very limited graphicswise
but thats what i love about the playstation one the games were not all about graphics unlike the psi am not a fan of ps at all or the recent ff titles
anyway the character designs are a lot more oldschool especially the black mage which looks pretty coolsound  this is one of the lowpoints of this game the sound isnt that amazing
ff  tactics  and  all have amazing soundtracks not to mention  as well but this one just doesnt amaze me
after playing through this game several times and mastering it several times i still dont really remember any tracks in the game
ffs soundtrack blew me away so i was hoping for the same here
the only highlights for music are on the start screen and the world music is pretty good as well as the battle musicgameplay the setup is pretty good making you choose abilities from items that are equipped and learn them
the junction system in ff was in my opinion one of the most innovative systems ever for a video games
this games isnt very innovative but its still a great idea that is fun to do
also theres synthesis shops now where you combine items to make armor
much like ffs weapon system except now you can also buy weapons and armor as well
overall this game has a great system that is a lot of fun
the card game isnt nearly as fun as ffs in my opinion though
in ff you collected cards and then could card mod them which was also an amazing idea but in this game the cards seem to do absolutely nothing for the player other than giving them knowledge that they completed the game  and achieved the highest card collecting level which is also pointless
overall the card game is just a lame rehash of ffs triad game so dont expect a blast playing cards here look to ff for thatcontrols basically the same controls as in every other ff game
now theres an exclamation mark which appears over zidanes head if you are near an item which was a pretty good ideastory  this is the games biggest weak point
in my opinion ff has the most forgettable story out of any ff game
sure it has its high points the idea of having summons attack the town was a great ideaand was pretty sweet to watch but other than that it didnt leave me feeling amazed
ff    tactics and heck they all had great storylines but ffs is pretty lame
you go after some little guy wearing a thong and thats about it it isnt deep like the other titles although at times it may appear that way
it wasnt the worst storyline but definitely not up to paroverall  i have spent a good deal of my life playing this game since it took a while to master my characters levels and find all the items and it was definitely worth it
this is a wonderful game that all rpg fans should playthis game is great
it goes back to the style of the older games  for the most part with very little of the technological influence where magic is powerful and makes you drool
ive liked all of the numbered ones to some extent  were great  was pretty good but  really lacked in too many areas but this one is my favoritethis one combines learning from what you have equipped as with espers in ff with a distinct party role for each member like in ff and ffff
magic is good again it  in ff and summons are cool and good in a pinch but not something youd wantbe able to use in every battlei liked that for the first time really you could do quite well with no extra effort to gain levels but with all the cool abilities theres a strong incentive to do just that
also the plot is good although still quite linearbut its really very difficult to fix that in a video game
for the first time in years ive felt drawn into the story by a video game and its extremely refreshingthis is a very good game
if you didnt like ff id recommend this one
its almost completely opposite
if you liked any of the previous ones especially ff or ff play this one because you will love itthis game is like the popular guy in school
it has lots of diehard fans because the designers made the game in a deliberate attempt to attract them
everyone liked the oprea scene in ff
then lets put a play in this one
and a card game like in ff
and some characters that were manufactured
and a princess and a dragoon
and lets make everything cute
in the design of this game eclecticism is a method rather than an influence as in the gradeschool exercise of writing a story and putting all of ones best friends in it yet the presentation of this game still somehow manages to be more mature than that of ffx although the plot is less compellingthe soundtrack for this game is superb featuring a great amount of quality music underscoring everything from the games characters to its environments to its events
the ability to split up while exploring towns and watch cut scenes chronicling the adventures of the estranged characters is cool and the characters are cool as well but unlike in ff another ff game with cool characters there is no dramatic impetus driving the story forward
as a player watching the cutscenes it is hard to root for particular outcomes of events because everything happens arbitrarily and whenever it seems that the party has finally inherited a mission the next plot point changes the whole situation and makes the mission obsolete rather than simply throwing an obstacle between the player and the completion of the missionthis game has the least systematic innovation of the entire ff series and the elements of the series battle system reprised in this game were never the series best in the first place
battles are fought ffivstyle with only one or two feasable choices for how to spend each characters turn theres a lack of variety of monsters within each environment and a lack of opportunities for the player to challenge himself by entering a dangerous environment before the plot demands it
the battle screen loads slowly and the battles themselves seem to run less smoothly than in any other atbbased ff game with frequent incidences of irrational lag between character turns and between the selection and execution of an action
sometimes an atb bar can fill from empty to full during this lag time making the order of turns just as confusing as if there were no atb bar at all
the prerendered backgrounds in ffix are individually even more gorgeous than those of ffvii or ffviii but ffix is significantly less atmospheric than either of those games with many sections of the map seeming to have been pasted together randomlythis great classic is starting to get old but is still a blast to play and the last classic final fantasythe first game i had ever played in the series was ff forsnes and it was great
although it was nearly  my sister and i saved enough to buy it
then i got ff as soon as it came out and so on
i even bought a playstation just to get ff
ff is a big improvement over ff but it still isnt as great as the masterful ff
even though i started out with the fantasytype quest of the early games i really loved the dark science fiction tone of ff
maybe thats one of the reasons why ff doesnt seem as good to me
i still like it though
it does remind me of the old snes days even with its superior graphics
the ability system is a definate improvement over ffs complicated junction system but it still can be confusing at times as you are constantly changing weapons and abilites
i really liked the materia system best
on a better note the world map is really good with its mist and upper levels
the world map of ff was very cheap
sure it was huge but a lot of it was just plain empty
the entire southern continent centra had almost nothing on it
just a house and a wierd ruin
not if ff
they dont cheat like thatas for the battle system though i think it just moves along too slow
the atb gauge is like a snail and battles can take a long time
still you have to gain levels a lot more in this game than in other ffs
it is noticably harderdont get me wrong i love the game
i just think it is a little flawed
dont let me discourage you if you are a fan of the series you still must have this gamei have never been a heavy video gamer but this year i decided to get back into a little bit of gaming and i decided ps rpgs were the best place to start
mind you i havent played video games for years but i found ffixs graphics to be more than satisfying
the game overall is tons of fun
the characters are all very interesting and the battle system is loads of fun
there is very little to look down on this game other than the story
the plot is terrible constantly shifting with no reason
at times the story gives me no reason to go on
inside disc  and  we go from saving the princess to having to fight the evil woman beatrix who then joins our side then we have to fight queen brahne who gets killed by kuja and now we have to fight kuja but kuja is overpowered by his real boss in the sky who takes his summoning dragon
the plot is worthless
fortunately the game is tons of fun and the characters individual story lines are interesting
cheersfinal fantasy ix is a great installment to the series
in particular the story is what is highlighted here and you get a lot of story
however it lacks in other elements and definitely does not deserve a five star ratingso i was a little late playing this one i just beat it  minutes ago unlocking all skills weapons and subquests
all in about  hours
so i guess i guess id consider myself a hardcore rpg guy and this was one of the few ffs along with  and  that i havent got to yet
and let me say i am quite pleased with a lot that this game offers but i still couldnt stand some aspects of the game so let me break it down by story gameplay animations and extrasstoryif the game was rated solely on the story  stars easily
while i cant say it was the best of ff it was just an overall solid intriguing story
it does start extremely slow and you might be like wtf is this but the story picks up gets better as you progress
even the ending satisfied me
one thing i didnt like was that it was a little excessive
sometimes you could press select to see a different thing happening at the time
usually these things were extremely insignificant and it happens a lotthe characters were okay but with their animation and choice of wardrobe it was sometimes hard to take them seriously
i will discuss that later but i also kind of wish the characters were a little bit more mature
i loved their personalities but cmon the princess is only  shes jail bait for crying out loud
one other thing i didnt like about characters was that some of them didnt really have a major part in the story
there could have been more to some of the characters in subquests but not the casegameplayanother important aspect
but i wasnt as fond of the gameplay
what i didnt like was the leveling up and trance
for leveling up its so difficult to find good grinding spots and it takes so long to level up
also i finished the game at level  for zidane and he only had about  hpanother thing is how damage is conducted
i obtained the summon ark from the subquest toughest boss in the game which was extremely time consuming and after a  minute cinematic presentation it only causes about  damage to regular enemies
ugh the knights of the round in ffvii would be laughingtrance was another issue
yea so its like a limit break okay but you just barely ever get to use it
instead of activating trance whenever you want it automatically happens which sucks because the battle is usually over by the time you get it and the gauge starts over
i didnt even get to use all the special attacks from zidanes trance in fact i think i only accessed it like three times
thats a definite step back from ffviis limit breaks or even dare me that of viiianimationdesignwhat was square thinking with the design
this was the reason i never was drawn to playing it all those years
the characters just looked too goofy or cartoonish
to my expectation and dis it was actually hard sometimes taking the story seriously with the cartoony animations zidane is a midget for crying out loudand what is with the choice of wardrobe
the princess wears an orange jumpsuit steiner wears what looks like a halloween knights costume and kuja really ticked me off by wearing some weird outfit that looks like something a hooker would wear as some type of fetish thing
idk i really wish square made a better effort to give the characters the animations they deserved
look at zidane in dissidia hes more lifelikesubquestsextrassubquests were okay but i think they could have been a lot better
this is where i spent all my time on including leveling up to beat optional bosses
the chocobo mini game and treasure hunt i found to be very fun
but unfortunately thats pretty much all i can say
other subquests were very hard to find very insignificant and not really part of the main story line
so just overall definitely okay but at the same time definitely lackingbottom lineso final fantasy ix to be brief is a step above ffviii but a step below ffix
dont listen to people who say its incredible
its not
its a great experience but if youre used to the greats like iv vii x then youll be pleased with this but not blown away
for me i had low expectations and was quite surprised
so try it out its a little lengthier than previous ffs but youll probably like it but im telling you it does have some faultsnormally any final fantasy game created would inflict upon me  a sense of adventure with a feeling that draws me into the game itself
however this game failed to do what the final fantasy games are all about
great story
i found myself entertained yes but the story in final fantasy ix just lacked the depth the previous two titles had
ffvii and ffviii were probably the two best games ever createdfinal fantasy ix has a rather cartoonish style which in my opinion is just fine it keeps players interested
i mus say for a ps game it looks great
i was thouroughly surprised with each new summon
and i stared at the screen in awe when i saw bahamut for the first time
awesomei give this game four stars just because of the lack of depth
i might add that the game did seem a little short totalling  gameplay with sidequeststhis is not a bad game do not get me wrong
innovative enough to keep any final fantasy goer interested but just not the same as  and   anyone who loves ff games should check out this title if they have not alreadythis game is great besides those borrrinnggg frussttrattinngg random battles like always
square needs to get a clue and develope a fun battle system for final fantasysxenogears had the best battle system but square still decides to go with that  system they use for final fantasysbesides that this game is sweet and is worth buying and by the way xenogears rulesfinal fantasy  is a cute and simple game
its not fun to play and towards the end of disc three kind of becomes a chore to finish the game off
the ending boss made no sense and every character gets lamerepetiveboring at one point or another
its predictability makes it too boring to play through sometimes though its ending is too cute its mediocre at bestbeing the first time i have ever played final fantasy i must say that i made a wise choice
the graphics are crisp and the story line is even better
people who have played star ocean or saga frontier  would really like this not to mention people who havnt
in my opinionpros nice graphics fun side quests good story and of course my favorite so many towns to visitcons takes a few seconds for it to load from scene to scene what i mean is when it goes from say a battle to back to the world map it will pause for a good  seconds
granted im sure its because of the graphics and thus being the only reason why i gave it  stars instead of baw baw baw what am i  vivicool game i like that it went back to the adventure fantasy of earlier final fantasiesthis game was alright but it was kind of boring overall
it seems like final fantasy viii and ix have traded traits as final fantasy viii had a great story but the gameplay sucked but final fantasy ix had alright gameplay but a pretty lame storystory the story really could be improved as it is pretty boring
its the usual destroy the evil person plot but with a few twists and sidequests
the story never hit me with the feeling of bliss when i beat the game as the ending really was not that greatsound and music very nice accomplishment
the victory theme is no longer distorted and has returned to a remixed traditional type
the sound is great also as swords sound like swords but daggers sound differently
magic spell sounds are topnotch as usualgameplay  at first the gameplay is pretty fun but once you progress through the game it starts to get quite boring
finally the beauty of final fantasy iv is revived as the black mage can only cast black magic the white mage can only cast white magic and healing spells and a summoner summons and also has white magic
zidane the main character knows no magic as he is a theif so he knows devious theiving skills
a lot of times the gameplay will get a little tediousmenus and puttogethers after final fantasy viii i gladly welcome final fantasy ixs menu functions with open arms
square finally dropped doing the irritating and pretty stupid materia system as well as the horridly timeconsuming junction system and put on the ability system
this is rather original and pretty cool
you learn abilities from items only not everyone can learn every ability i might add which portrays a descisive challenge to the player because you wonder if you should keep a weaker weapon equipped that lets you learn a really good ability or try to take on this hard boss with a really strong weapon but dont have the ability
this is honestly the first menu i actually had fun dealing withgraphics cmonits squaresoft and its final fantasy
you know they are going to have good graphics
the fmv sequences are topnotch not as good as final fantasy viiis but im not complaining the people look like people and the only problem i have with the graphics areprincess garnether figure is definately not very good looking
they have way too many details on hercharacters im fine with all the characters except for one
all of the final fantasies have one or two terrible characters
for example ffiv had edward useless ffvi had gau irritating ffvii had cait sith downright stupid ffviii had selphie ugh and now ffix hasquina irritatingquina is not that useful and you are forced to use him near the beginning of the game but you dont have to use him onward which i am thankful forreplay value its an alright game but once i finished it i felt no need to ever play it again as it was really long and pretty boring
i say you rent it firstits still worth playing if you are a true ff fan
loads of fun and some really great graphics
do get this game a true classic to playas a game this is awsome it is fun has a pretty good replay abality and the story isnt that bad
but before giving it five stars you have to compare it to the rest of the series and basically it doesnt live up to its predecessors
it tries to go back to the original final fantasys with the game play but because of this it is unoriginal and a little bit playedout
it might be unfair to try and compare it to the rest of the series but this game seems to try and get by on name sake and unless your a diehard ff fan or else are positive you really want this game go out and try ff vi or vii because i assure you they are much betterone of the things that have made the final fantasy series one of gamings longest running hits is that each new game tells a unique story with new characters and plot machinations
while certain factors of rpg playing on gaia remain constant squaresoft has managed to create infinite variations on the theme of overcoming enormous odds in order to save the worldin terms of what a ps one roleplaying game can be final fantasy  lies close to the limit
extensive use of graphic cut scenes detailed characters and backgrounds complicated points of view  all of that is here and more
as such it represents a watershed moment in the game developers art even though it was promptly overmatched by what could be done on a ps
oddly enough ps games are not all that much better and the ps itself is already struggling with its own limitationsdespite all of these positive factors my gut reaction to ff is that it is a lesser game than ff or   some of this has to do with the adoption of a weaker and less complex plot
understand that i dont mean this is a bad plot just that it is lighter in weight and thus less compelling than its immediate predecessors
there are also some tedious elements in game play that drag out battles
this makes leveling up a bit of a pain
of course the bosses are less of a challenge here so levelling up is not as important as it has beeni believe that the one thing that tempered my initial reaction to the game was the cartoonish nature of the characters
there is an element of silliness in the design of characters like vivi and quina that kept me at arms length for longer than usual before the game builds finally them into more solid characters
eventually one gets past that reaction but i had to make an initial effort towards suspension of disbelief that i havent had to make in any other game in the seriestaken by itself this could very easily be mistaken for a star game
but in the context of its fellows and my expectations it fell just a bit short
this is still an eminently satisfactory game that stands above many of its competitors
if you liked ff and  you are going to like ff as well
no doubt about thative always been an rpg gamer but just now getting around to ffix
im about halfway through and have a good enough feel for the game to write an accurate review
that and im in the moodproscharacters are more defined as magic users  fighters as oppose to ff and ffstory gets exciting starting on cd classic battle systemsurprisingly challengingalways alot going on different groups of allies doing different things think ff snesyou learn skills by equipping items and fighting with them
this is kinda the new twist in the series at the point the game was made like getting magic from enemies in ff  or the leveling system in ffxconssteiner a character in the game is as annoying as crap the whole first cdthe first cd and  the beginning of the second i feel are fairly weak
about a quarter through the second cd is where the plot is picking up and the games starting to get funthe limit break system is useless
it fills up slow and you lose it all at the end of the battle even if the character doesnt get to attackso in conclusion this is a good solid rpg but you gotta go through the first  hours which are fairly mundanefinal fantasy ix has to be one of the best video games ive ever played in a long time
ive played a lot of rpgs and while i still think enix has the best storylines squaresoft never fails to please its audience with a fine gameafter the inconsistent reviews of the outcome of final fantasy viii i can understand how the sales were rather sluggish at first
i personally dont hold anything against number viii i rather liked it
but i can also understand why people didnt like viii since certain points rather bugged me about it toothe storyline is unlike any other
it goes back to its routes in medieval times with dragons castles towns and four party members
every character has their own class  thief mage fighter etc
it kind of takes away the joy of equipping magic in final fantasy vii but also takes away the pain of the constant drawing of the magic in final fantasy viiiand the idea of the main hero being a complete jerk was realized by square that its time for a change
in this one the hero is some optimistic flirt which i honestly prefer over the antisocial pessemistthe plot in this game has many more twists than it did in final fantasy viii in which it was rather linear
instead of being hesitant to starting a new game youll want to get on it right away after completing it to see certain things that you may have missed that you missed in your previous gamefinal fantasy ix is a very good game for anybody to own
i honestly think that everybody should have a chance to play it
its still debatable about how zidanes appearance confused people if he was either male or female but its still fun to enjoyi have the original version psx but i halted on cd because the official guide sucks
now i even cant retrieve codes from square enix or 
recently i checked ps online and found this game and now its for psp
it is fun to carry it everywhere to fill up an hour of train ridethe only down side is its too addictive
you dont realize you spent a few hours a day just for playing the gameif you want a strategy guide search it on internet for textonly version
stay away from official guidefinal fantasy ix wouldve been great
but there is something very stupid and annoying about it
the steal rate is very low like  chance success rate
if i knew this i wouldve never bought the game
the game would be badass without it
it is a waste of the players lifethis is a such a great game
it carries on the atbactive time bar
it has more of an old school look to it
you play as a thief and help aid a black mage an eidolin adept and a princess
who knows what kind of misadventures you might get into
play this game and you will find out just how good it is
even if it doesnt quite live up to final fantasy unlike the last  games from ff this ones a little more based on the old gameplay of final fantasy
the storys pretty straightforward the graphics are great and theres no weird anime stuff like in  and  plus the fightings back to normal
what the hell was with the fighting in 
anyway my favorite character would have to be steiner
hes a jerk but hes good at fighting
probably the strongest member
also vivi kicks rear
especially near the end
solid gamefinal fantasy  is one of the best rpgs ever made thats a given but can it compete with todays rpgs
the graphics in the game are crisp
there is not an abundant of cutscenes to bore the gamer out of there mind
the sidequest are fun for dedicated final fantasy games
the chocobo sidequest takes a while and can get difficult
tracking the chocobos paradise can be difficult at times
one thing is sure the optionals boss fights are hard
ozma comes a level  and unless your characters are at a high level do not even bother trying
i would recommend level a party of zidane amarantquina and dagger
have quina use frog drop every turn
have dagger use summons
use amarants throw chakrarevive abilities
use zidanes thivery and if he goes into trance do not use his grand lethal dyne ability conserve you mp you wil need it
wear shadow absorbing armor
the card game can be hard at times
use your strongest four cards
have a weak card that has arrows on all sides and use this to your advantage
to level up fast move west past the mist continent till you come to some islands
there are dragons there that can be beaten with quinas level  death skillfinal fantasy  is squaresofts latest sequel to their long running extremely popular series of role playing games
the series returns to its roots this time around
no hightech societies filled with laser guns and flying cars herejust traditional dungeons and dragons medievil weapon battles ect
thankfully the drawingspellsfromenemies feature that was in final fantasy  is replaced with the old style magic points system
while some of the characters are new and original others seem like watered down versions of past ones kuja is similar to sephiroth from ff
the card game is back also although it plays a less significant role this time
the bottom line is youll see many features that are new but youll also see things that are tired and oldlike the names of the summon characters and spells for example i dont understand why that in every final fantasy square has refused to change them
if you are a long time fan of the series theres enough here to keep you playing
in my opinion final fantasy  is better than  but not quite as good as ff is a great game
black mages white mages knights dragoons thieves moogles airships castles dragons return in a medieval theme rpg
im glad square decided to make the theme medieval like the classic ffs i was getting a little tired of the futuristic themes from ff and ff
great game i tell ya in comparison with the other final fantasies this is just below parthe character development for this isnt as clean as say viiithe eidolonsummon feature is a little shakythe ending is a tad disappointingthe soundtrack is not uematsus bestbutits still very very fun to playthe visuals are as usual stunning fmvs normal gameplayalthough not uematsus best the soundtrack gets better over time go pick up the piano tracks after youre done theyre marvelousthe story is goodthe references to old final fantasies are funiv and viii still remain at the top of my list but this installment in the series is still very very good
if youve got some time pick this upagaintheres some real issues with the artwork hereoh wellnow that title is saying something because i found that this ff was by far the easiest soul cage can be killed just by casting life
but that aside this game is still brilliantthe characters interact with eachother well and when vivis friends are attacked thats just as heart wrenching as aeris spoiler
kuja is second evilest villain ever below sepiroth and all the characters have their own individual skills so you dont have to worry about teams being unbalnced
one thing i would say is a disadvantage is the trance system for some people its very good zidane has some cool dyne moves but for others it is completely pointless there isnt much difference between summon and eidolon besides that though the combat system is greatbuy this if you have ff
if not buy that first as it is the best game to get you into the ff world universe dimension etcfinal fantasy ix reverts back to older games in the series not like  or  but even further more like the series on the nes
why
well it has a mage vivi
the game was pretty good but if youve played other final fantasy games you probably would be very familiar with the story  betrayal love lots of magic weapon upgrades and eidolons godlike creatures that can be called upon to fight the enemy briefly similar to guardian forces in 
its a fun game and battles gradually get more difficult towards the end
youll need to understand how to use upgrade skills and weapons properly to win some of the tougher fightsof course its all a fantasy game
theres no such thing as magic or guardian forces however much people may try and convince you otherwise but you meet a lot of very interesting people throughout the videogame get to see well done cgi movies throughout and learn about all the different people as you journey along
this one was on the psx so you dont get to hear any audio clips along with the movies like ffx on the psi did enjoy the game and will probably play another one in the future
some of the most dedicated fans would really like to play a ff but ive still got a few more in the series i could try or play older ones on the snessquaresoft had gotten a bit bizarre and outlandish with some of their rpgs that came after final fantasy vii and ix
from an artistic point of view they created titles that explored various systems for combat tactics strategy and storytelling some which worked better than othersfinal fantasy ix comes back to what really works in an rpg which is plain heroism discovery adventure and mysterysquaresoft did it again
they managed to make another great ff
although i did like a few other ffs more than this one and i do have to admit i bought it with great hopes that it would be the best and it sort of let me down
but if you buy it dont expect it to be omg wow
because u may be let down but other than that i loved it to death and would buy it in a secondi have loved final fantasy games for a long time
so when i saw this game i just had to have it
its game strategy is similar to the final fantasy viii strategy
a new feature is the treasure hunt game by the chocobo
the characters are humanized animals which is quite a cute approach
it is difficult and tough to proceed at certain parts in the game so i stopped playing the game kind of put it on ice haha
it is a good game if you can get all the way through
i dont know why they make games so hard to solve sometimes or is it just mei started playing this game because i was having problems with my copy of viii
after hearing how bad it was from everyone i knew who played it i was surprised to find that i was enjoying it
its fun to play a less emotionally complicated lighter game
the graphics are so much better than viii its not even funny
gameplay is definitely final fantasy but uncluttered by complications
im going to wait to get a different copy of viii until i can complete this one
and if i happen to complete this one when x comes out then viii will wait longerfinal fantasy viii was a bit dissapointin cuz it was boring and this is where final fantasy ix gets the series back on trackprosgreat fmvsjust like other ffs great gameplayu get  people on a squadvery good abilitiespretty good love story jes like all the other ffsgreat endinggreat battle systemstory seems dumb at first but gradually gets betterit has some decent sound effecsthe game is pretty longbeat it in  hoursthe replay value depends on how u like the gameit has three endings altho there really not worth gettingits worth  check outtrance may not be as good as a limit break but still pretty coolsquare is the king of rpgs and this is one of their greatestconskuja is pathetic and so is the boss after him lacking a good final fightstiner in the first  discs would never just shut upa loooooooong boring wait to get to the ending fmvif u get poisoned or something jes like ff ur stuck with it unless u use somethintents dont fully recover health which is really messed upif there  and  how come they look like there  and how come u can choose to trance or not to trance that pissed me offwhy did they make the affects of potions and ethers less on the feildit has its share of good and bads but hey this game is more good than bad i would give it a   stars if they had it
its better than a boring and dissapointing final fantasy viii but its not as good as final fantasy x and no rpg will beat the greatest rpg if not the greatest game ever final fantasy vii
if u love rpgs or if u are a fan of final fantasy you should have this game or get itpeaceafter over a year of waiting for this title i feel dissapointed
dont get me wrong on its own this is a great game
compared to many games out there this is one of the best an all time great
but compared to final fantasy vii and viii this is a somewhat poor efforti am not a final fantasy follower the first one i played was vii and the only other one ive played is viii so as far as this review is concerned i will only be talking about the new generation of the gamethe graphics are good
the fmv sequences are breathtaking
however in both cases they are no different to the quality of graphics and fmv in ffviii
infact with the cartoonstyle characters you could even say that the graphics on ffviii are better
the storyline is up to the usaual high standard not as good as vii equal with viii
the sound is virtually the same as the previous two adventures also
the game itself has introduced an ability system not complicated but more stupid
why can only  characters use summons
limit breaks are not as good or easy to get
zidane looks like a girl
the characters are not as good as they could have been and nowhere near as good as the cast of ffvii and ffviiidont get me wrong  i absolutely love the game
it is in my top ten all time favourite games
it is a great title
however compared to previous games this is not as good
if youre new to the series buy  then  dont buy  first because then  when you buy it wont blow you away as much
playing  i didnt have the same passion to play it
with the other titles i was on them for ages hours and hours at a time but when it came to  i just found it irritating and annoying  like im saying i cant be bothered to play this
its not as addictive if youve played the others anyway and not as gripping  it still keeps you glued to the screen but not in the same way that vii and viii did
maybe im getting bored of the series after playing vii and viii to death
you decide  in the end this is just my opinionbtw the card game tetra master is crap  triple triad is much betterfian fantasy  has go to be the best one out of the series so far
the graphics on this one are far superior to the previous outings as they seem more crisp and and there is more attention to detail
the control method is the same as in the previous ones so any of the old fans will be able to jump right in from the start
there are plenty of new weapons and new magic which eill keep any fan happy until fianl fantasy  comes out on playstation  i cant waitthis was a great game and took the final fantasy series in a different direction than recent games along the series
the game feels and looks without the pixelation like the first few ff gamesi would rate this game as being better than ff but worse than ff
i liked the fact that they went back to the old look of ff
the battle system wasnt all that great but the music and story were decent enough
just go buy itnow before you look at this and mark it unhelpful because i didnt give  stars just listen to my reasons first
i love final fantasy and i love ff however for me it is the weakest of all the recent ffs  and  not including x which isnt really in the series as suchmy main gripe with the game is that it was far too easy on my first time completing it i only died once and that was because i ran into the secret boss hades by mistake
i also did not have to go out of the way to build the character levels up like in previous games
i know some find this annoying but for me it is an important part of the challenge of a good rpg and by not having to build the characters up it is only catering to the casual gamerdespite this it is still a great game ive never played a bad ff game the locations are great the plot is good though the characters arent especially engaging
as usual there is plenty to do outside of the regular game though again not as much as previous ffs and the card game is cp compared to triple triad on ff
i would honestly recommend this game to anyone despite what ive said it is a great game it just felt like a disappointment on the back of ff   i honestly dont know why people rate this higher than  i cant see it myself at allplease note as well avoid the official strategy guide for this game it is awful see my review for more infodont get me wrong
i love the final fantasy series but square kinda rushed this game
in the final fantasy series i would have to say that final fantasy  tops rhem all  unfortunitly
but this game is pretty fun
but the caracters are very goofy looking and there is too much story line and most of it is not so good
i like this one alot more then final fantasy  though
unlike no
 every caracter has their own abilties and that was a major improvement over final fantasy 
on fianal fantasy  the only differnce in the chacters is thier limit breaks
wich was very sad
none of them have a special feature to seperate them
in final fantasy  however each character gets differnt spells skills and soforth
but this one resembles no  the most out of  amp 
i dont care much at all for d graphics in role playing games
it kinda ruins the fun
but the graphics in final fantasy  are bareable
the coloring is fantastic and the battle backrounds are cool
the game play hours were kinda dissapointing too but they are pretty good
another down side of this game is it is too easy
the enemys and bosses are jokes
it is not as near as chalanging as it should be
but as the game as a whole it is fun and enjoyable
the dudes you sommon in this game are cool looking and they are not to long like in final fantasy  and  i would recomend this one over final fantasy  and final fantasy i picked up cart fury the other day and for the most part its a fun driving game
very arcade style game play
very easy to learn the controls
the graphics where pretty good too
there a little cartoonsih but nothing to bad
the only down side i saw too it and its nothing big i wish there was an replay mode after a race
i think it would be pretty cool to see diffrent angles of the raceoverall if your a race fan and you cant wait till gt comes out this should tide you over till theni was an avid fan of indystyle racing long before the cartirl split so i figured i would enjoy cart fury
however i love the game primarily because it gets away from simulationstyle racing gamesat fps the action is fast and furious
except for the nearlyimpossible simulation mode all the features of the game are very arcadeized
even the courses based on realworld circuits are arcadeized for example compare surfers paradise australia in cart fury and newmanhaas racing and the arcadization is explicit
however success often depends on how many cars in front of you crash and burn and this usually occurs directly in front of you making rapid reflexes a mustperhaps the biggest pitfall of the game is the cast of objectified women
on many screens one of these busty ladies  supposedly a crew chief  gives you tips or information as you make a menu selection or wait while the game loads
after winning a race or championship your car is shown on a raised platform while a videoscreen behind the car shows these same women dancing presenting a trophy and generally trying to be hypersexual
this will likely turn off most female players from this gameif the simulation mode was easier and the games loading times faster i would definitely rate this as a quotquot  overall objectifiaion aside this is a great game for those who are not simulation fansmidways cart fury is a great game
this game plays alot like midways other arcade hit hydro thunder
there are a few similarities such as secret paths power ups and it being incredibly challengingthere are quite a few differences which are all good
this game uses cart cars open wheel indy style race cars with actual big name drivers that you can select such as michael andretti christian fittapaldi adrian fernandez max papis bryan herta gil de ferran and a few othersthe graphics are absolutely stunning
the sheer sense of speed is uncanny
wait until you see cars explode and scatter debris on the track right in front of you this is extremely cool
the selection of tracks is large and are very fun to race on
the two player mode is a blast to play
the super boost power up is too cool for words
the soundtrack could have been a little better  the song that plays during the menu selection will have you hitting the mute button on your tv temporarilythe mini games will have you playing this game longer when you get bored with the single race or season modes
there are also several things that you have to unlock in this game that depends on how you finish in a racebottomline  this game has excellent graphics extremely fun gameplay and great replay value
you will keep playing this one for a long time even after gran turismo  arrives in julyhighly recommendedi have come back to play close combat invasion normandy cc after reading a few books about dday and operation overlord
if you are interested in the history around this game i would recommendutah beach the amphibious landing and airborne operations on dday june  by joseph balkoski orcrosschannel attack united states army in world war ii
the european theater of operationsby gordon harrison
i really enjoyed taking command of the units involved in operation overlord
cc is centered on the airborne attack of the cotentin peninsula and the amphibious landing at utah beach
the other beaches omaha gold juno and sword do not form part of the base game
however i have played a well done mod for a gold juno and sword campaign
there were other mods out there based on great fan community efforts as well
look up close combat mods or closecombatseries on google to find them
the series has also been picked up by matrix games
they have done remakes of several of the close combat games
seeclose combat  longest dayclose combat wacht am rhein andclose combat  cross of iron
i have not played these so i cannot comment on their qualityif you are not familiar with the close combat series basically it is a wwii real time strategy game where you control approximately  allied or german troops split between  units in each battle
each battle is self contained meaning you cannot call in reinforcements until the battle ends
there is no building of units and bases or researching technologies
this is a combat simulator
you give the troops orders but they also react to their environment
they take evasive action if fired upon
they may ignore orders or even surrender if suppressed by enemy fire or sustain heavy casualties
each soldier is individual
he has a name with unique attributes which can change based on his experiences in each battle
each soldiers amount of kills acts of bravery and cowardness are recorded from battle to battle
soldiers can get metals and promoted at the end of each battle if their actions justify it
the campaign mode allows you to move battle groups from sector to sector and engage the enemy where individual battles are fought each turn
the graphics are d top down view and are not spectacular by modern standards
line of sight and elevations of terrain and buildings are all taken into account
cover works well and it is defined to each individual soldier not by unit
terrain is destructible to a limited degree but not as much as modern games
what i would like to see is the close combat structure combined with the graphics ofcompany of heroes
close combat still has something to offer for war simulator puristsin regard to historic accuracy of cc i have noticed some inaccuracies with the german units but the american forces were located at the right locations to start the game
the game is a bit too easy to play for experienced players against the computer ai even with settings at their most difficult
the american campaign is a little harder than playing as the germans
it has been a while since i have played multiplayer but i recall it being fun and intense
since there is still a gaming community for close combat i imagine you can still get a game going
one of the things i really dont like is how battle groups are disbanded if they are knocked off a map
i think the game would been much more interesting if losing the map forced the retreat to another sector with some kind of penalty instead of just being disbanded
it is also unrealistic for a battle group to get disbanded just to reappear at the edge of the campaign map later on
because of this i still prefer themicrosoft close combat  a bridge too farbased on operation marketgardencc is very stable
i remember running it on a desktop with no problems  years ago
i did notice the graphics are a little glitchy on the laptop im playing it on now but this machine is not build for gaming poor graphics card
i dont recall ever having any crashes thoughthis game has gotten a lot of bad press
a lot
i dont even know where to begin describing how much undue criticism pool of radiance has received but i would advise anybody out there not to believe all the hypedont get me wrongthis software wont be redefining any genres
however aside from a couple of bugs that should be fixed before the week is out it still manages to solidly provide an experience not dissimilar from that youd find in the original ssi gamesthis game isnt for everybody either
in particular there will be a sizeable population of the baldurs gate and diablo crowds that will find the play interminably slow
thats to be expectedthis game isnt targeted at this audience
what pool of radiance does provide however is a solid dungeon crawl and one of the better attempts at turnbased combat in recent memoryi havent encountered a single bug in thirty plus hours of playing so i wont bother commenting on that particular complaint but i would think that the effects ie
quotit ate my windowsquot some people are using as an excuse to throw around labels like quotvirusquot are mostly fabrications or stories heard from a guy who heard what happened to some other guy
generally speaking if you dont run any programs that will interrupt the install or uninstall process youll be fineso is the game enjoyable
well that really depends
if youre looking for a braindead exercise in mouse clicking and keep in mind that i like diablo myself or an expansive story youre not going to find that here
however folks who remember the old gold box games or people who are just looking for a game that roughly approximates sitting around the table with your friends as opposed to the console feel that a great many crpgs are adopting this is where you want to becaveat emptorlet the buyer bewarepool of radiance has been shredded by the masses
people who dont believe in the death penalty want to kill the people at ubi soft
why
well that is a good questionfirst off let me say this game has some serious issues right out of the box which in my belief are the fuel for the fires of irritation which seem to consume most all of the reviewers
apparantly ubi was in such a hurry to get out this game which has laid dormant for so long they forgot to do adequate beta testing
to worsen things there seems to be some squabble between the producers ubi soft and the developers as to whose fault it is
without being privy to that knowledge the most logical culprit is ubi soft since most of the game code was written litteraly years ago
besides one of the quirks was no uninstall program which is definitely ubis faultanyway the major problems are  no uninstall strange problems with corrupted data on the game saves not enough d hardware support and a crash near the end of the game
these problems will be addressed by patches which today  there are two which fix the  unistall and the  game save corruption
the third quotmegaquot patch should fix all the other technical problems folks are whining about like d support mainly and other errors and bugsperhaps since there are so many bad problems with this first release they will rerelease the game with all the fixes in therei hope sothe above bugs are why the game received four stars and not fivefolks say that por has slow battles
yes they are slow
they are turned based sort of like playing an rpg with dice except they are not that slow and they are not at all boring
the graphics are fantastic and the weird stagger of zombies and ghouls and ghasts gives you the creepswhich couldnt happen if they all ran to meet you or if they just appeared
the folks that say game play is slow dont bother to offer any solution as to how a turned based game could have quicker combat
and personally i love combat
the more time i spend in combat the more fun i have
it is tactical turned based combat like xcom which was one of the best games of all timeso if you think this game is real time read the box
it is just turned based
so if you hate turned based games dont buy this gamethey say the interface sucks
well i for one didnt have to read the manual to figure out how to play the game
that to me says the interface is intuitive at least for weirdos like me
if pull down menus annoy you dont buy this game
otherwise it is pretty much just like baldurs gate or icewind dale
the only difference is they have more stupid icons
now is that really that difficult to usebtw i am a baldurs gateicewind dale fanaticthe third edition rules are much better to me than the second edition because they are more logical
they are more difficult to understand in a lot of ways unless your name is spock but they add much more dimension to the gamethere are some discrepencies between this game and the actual third edition rules but that is because the rules werent solidified when they were making the game
however the rules they have are fair balanced and very interestingthe dungeons are huge
there are interesting puzzles interesting bits of dampd lore traps galore undead crawling from the cracks and even undead orcs and lizardfolk
i mean there are some very creative situations you will run into down there that add to the feel of a real dungeon crawl
the fact that they have a dungeon master really really really adds to the aura of those old days of dice and graph paper for those real rpgrs out therei mean sure all this stuff is trite when you come down to itthats why they call it lore
but it is the unexpected creativity you see the interesting stories and the fun new character system that i really enjoy
sort of being immersed in a whole new world of ahhhhhif you have better than a voodoo  card in your system and the most up to date driver you shouldnt experience many problems theoretically
i can only speak for myselfi have run it on my home ghz dell with a gefore  ultra and the new whql driver from nvidiathe game really runs well on that setup
make sure you have the latest whql driver on your system since there is no tweaking program for video
and if you dont understand the above paragraph i wouldnt buy the game at all
at least not until they have more d supportso in conclusiondont buy this game ifyour impatientyou dont have a connection to the internetyou have an old computer with poor specsyou like second edition dampd rules onlyyou like real time gamesyou hate pull down menusyou are easily annoyed by crashes and bugsbuy this gameyou love the new rd edition rulesyou love huge dungeonsyou love great graphicsyou have a nice fairly new graphics card with a new driveryou have decent specs on your home systemyou want an immersive world with a rich story lineyou know how to download a patch and install ityou are patientyou dont care what others thinkwhen i got this game i was so amazed
this isnt the normol pin ball thingyit has pin ball mini games and in the main feiled  plungersyour pin ball can even go on roller costerstheres the fun zone thril zone and main zonethe fun zone can take you to a nother pin ball world to play a game or just put some stuff on the main feildthe thrill zone is were you try and put you pin ball on a ride the more you get it on the more points you geta hole lot of modes like the night time fantisy and the rappids modeone of the most importint rules of the game is haveing funa fun challenging game that will most likely fulfil your simbusiness needs
when you first start out you will be without a manual however there are preset in game scenarios that help you to get adjusted to the basic workings of the game and to help you move around and get accostomed to the gameplay
for a tycoon game it was quite exceptional and surprisingly entertaining even if you ae not a fan of sim and tycoon games you may still want to check this one outi brought fast food tycoon a few years back because i enjoy playing the demo i got online
it is one of my favorite classic game like theme hospitalproslove the graphic you get to do other things besides make pizzas like sell weaponssabotage your competitors and make your own style of pizzacons wish you can serve more than just pizza and hard to understand how to play at the beginning since it doesnt come with a manual
overall enjoyed it very much and plan on gettting fast food tycoon this product will allow you to save all your original playstation games on either an original psx psone or ps console
it works great
no problems with mine
it cant hold very many save files but  hey  for what it does it cant be beat
always buy first party accessories for your systems  whether sony nintendo or microsoft  as its the only way you can be assured of the highest qualityin any event this is a very reliable product and if you  like me  love to play older games this card is a musthave
like i said good product good pricethe only problem is that some games like nfl blitz take up alot of space but i havent lost any information with this one and the only reason i didnt give it  stars is my rug is gray and i tend to lose it to the gods of camoflauge when i take the memory card outfor anyone who has more than three ps games your going to need one of these
now that ps is out these really arent in demand as much since many kids are just jumping on the gaming band wagon with the ps and have no ps games to speak of
for all us others who have been around since the snes was a baby me being  it is almost a guarantee youll need and probably already own one of these
obviously this is your only choice and it does what it promises it saves your games and will keep them their inless you wash it an infuriating mistake
unfortuneately this is a very inconvienant way to store data since there are only  blocks and many games can take upward of three blcoks just to save one file
since these arent in demand in much these days theyre also very cheap
i own about  ps games and hav the saves spread across about  memory cards
i found a great deal at target that can get you three memory cards just like this one for the same price as this one
another alternative to the space dilemma is getting a super memory card that can have upward of  blocks of saving space for just a bit more cashi didnt think this was a bad storage system but it wasnt that great either
 blocks is not nearly enough to hold all of what you can save
in fact i have up to  memory cards now because i couldnt find a mega memory card in timewhen you play games like madden  and stuff then you need more space
some sports game take up  spaces of memory on one card
are you telling me that your gonna settle for that
think about it for a moment
if you play some games then its easy one blockbut what about some of the rpgers who may have a favorite boss fight
or the actionadventure gamers who have a favorite level or part of the game
what about the sports gamers who have to save up to the entire memory cardwell im not saying for you to buy this but im not saying leave it alone either
if you buy this memory card youll have to buy plenty more where that came fromits a memory card what more can i say
it does its job its not like i leashed it up and took it for a walk around the blocki have enjoyed playing this game alot more than i thought i would
the levels are pretty well thought out and each has a story to go along with the battle
there are quite afew different people to choose from which is always a good thing
but only one girl character that i have seen
the graphics are pretty good and the combat exciting
after long battles though it does start to get very similar
there is not many things that is wrong with this game
a little more in battle rpg events would have been nice
but for all intents and purposes this is a good solid game and much fun to playif you remember and loved games like final fight and golden axe youll definitely love this game
if you didnt well im sure youll find something nice on pseventuallyeveryone else you know the drill
one man versus the horde
you decimate it one man at a time
only thing is youve got a horde on your side as well
i havent seen anything quite as gorgeous as the clash of two large enemy squads in a chaotic melee with archers firing into the mix while you hack slash and send fifteen armed men flying twenty feet away from you in all directions
i dont think ive ever seen anything like that on a video game everand dont think this is pure hack and slash
you go through it with that mindset youll have to replay levels a whole lot
strategy is involved
your army has many fronts on which it fights and it usually fights a losing battle
typically the only way to turn the tide is to rush to that front and get medieval on everyones buttocks
however if you go and reinforce one front the others typically fail
do you press on where you are or rush to that battle front thats become too close to high command
also you need to pay attention to messages on screen
a lot of times theyll tell you someone whos intregal to a plan that would turn the battle in your favor and you should do your damnedest to protect him
if you just hack and slash and let that vip fall youll probably lose the battle
other times theyll just tell you to protect your commanders hide which youd better do since his death counts as losing
that said its still heavily steeped into hack and slash and fans of xenaesque rampages wont be disappointedok ai can be extremely dumb
its not uncommon to watch soldiers stand with their backs turned to you as you pound them to the ground
they also have a tendency to get stuck running back and forth between obstacles
but its also not uncommon to see rough and tumble brawls between squads as spears and swords swing and bodies fly especially when youve got opposing officers in the fray
there have been plenty of instances when friendly troops have saved me from an extreme beating
friendly archer fire will find their marks in the guy beating on you or that lowly spearman next to you will club your opponent from behind allowing you time to recoverit can get real frustrating from level  and on i must admit
but so far it only gets me mad makes me curse a whole lot and want to crush the guy who made me lose
im thoroughly addictedoh yeah if you dont like heavy grungy rock music you might want to play this on mute
while it seems absurdly out of place for the setting that being ancient china it does fit with the setting of liberally dealing out hardcore thrashings on your foes
personally it gets me pumped for morei recently puchesed a ps and since then ive been renting all sorts of games but i have to say that dynasty warriors  is about as good as they come
its a good mix of stratagyactionand koei even through a little bit of first person shooting in there
graphics are awsome although in the heat of battle there is somthimes graphic break up and slowdown
gameplay is outstanding
despite what people sayyou can do tons of movesthere are  main attack buttons plus a special attack an in air attack and a running attackplus you can whip together some wicked combos leaving your enemies stunned or just knocking them  feet in the airthere are plenty of characters to choose form  starting ones and if you put in the right codes or you can get them legit but i dont know how you can get almost  fighters
another cool aspect is the jump butten which will come in handy when your army is off pickin strawberries and your surrounded by like  enemey fighters
the enemey generals are hard and you are often faced with the decision to charge in or stay back and fight with your fellow warriors
much like an rpgyou get stats in this game tothe stats are picked up when a general is killed be it your own or the enemies but weather you like hacking up dozens of enemies at a time with your weapon or sniping them off with your bow or just trampleing them on horseback other than a few minor flaws like the repetition i strongly recomend this game for any that is familior with the romance of the three kingdoms series or just likes to kill stuffwith a difficulty selection this game is nothing short of a challengemy personal reasons for loving this game for those who care my story starts about  years ago when i accidentally got an old rpg for christmas called quotdestiny of an emperorquot wondering what it was
i soon found out it was meant for my cousin but since he asked for it so much we found there were two copies bought and i kept my copy just the same
it played like final fantasy i years before i ever saw a final fantasy but with armies of troops instead of hp
i learned the names of these heroes over the years of liu bei guan yu zhang fei zhao yunetc and the lands such as chen du shu and the han dynasty
the game took me over  years to beat
it was a superb gamethen around the time of the ps launch a local store was playing this game as a demo
quotdamnquot i thought to myself quotlook at that simple interface
look at those amazing graphicsquot  i knew that this game would eventually come into my ps library but i didnt know it had to be soon until a month later when i saw that the character name was quotzhao yunquot
i knew this character
he is like an old best friend of mine
i looked further and found the familiar names of liu bei guan yu and zhang fei
i got this game for christmas
now i only pray that every time i get a game about quotthe romance of the three kingdomsquot era what the era is called i hope i always receive it on christmas
for the record i used to pronounce liu bei as quotlooee bellquotnow the game itself like i stated earlier the gameplay is clean and simple and the graphics are phenomenal
nobody will ever have a hard time adjusting to playing the game or believing it to be real characters or people
this game can be learned in less than three minutes and mastered in about another hour so that then you are a powerhouse of skill and technique
the story is told in cutscenes before each level each that psyche you up to fight but leave you wondering what is going to happen whether you are going to triumph or fail due to the enemys great strategieswhile individual units have low ai the collective of about  troops all at once combined must use the ps emotion chip to full extent
you are only forced to sit through  seconds of loading before each level and that is to generate the ai and the textures and polygons of thousands of units
sometimes do you get slowdown but its incredibly rare sometimes not for weeks straight of playing and when it does slow down its more like a dramatic slowmotion effect rather than becoming choppy
this game gives you hours of fun and never ceases to be cool
even the outofplace music is really cool here
the worriers dance to ithowever amidst the greatness there are three major problems that make me give this a review lower than the perfect score
any side you choose to play will win and you dont exactly know who won the war in official history at least not much until you take notes of the dates and forces involved
the first two levels are easy except lu bu when suddenly the third level whichever kingdom you choose turns up the difficulty exponentionally
and it is only five missions per scenario
i know that it is because there werent that many actual battles no more than that really and being the way it is it is more nonfictional than longlasting fun
at least the replay value is very highoverall if you can forgive the game for its shortcomings then get up right now and buy this game or buy it here immediately
it is one of the funnest and most energetic games i have ever played and it shows off a good chunk of the pss capabilities
han dynasty foreverthis game was really wild
it definetly shows off what the ps can do
having about  characters on the screen at one slaughtering each other is pretty amazing
although the only drawback i found from this was i never made it out of the first battle and i was playing for like a half hour
i dont know how long the battles are supposed to last but boy was my thumb tired
i had racked up almost  quotkosquot before i finally got beat by one of the bosses on the computer side and about  of his soldiers where were my troops when i needed them
id recommend this game but beware its not really a strategy game
you run around and kill as many guys as you can if you get low on life then you pick up what appears to be an onion and youll gain health back
you can also pick up upgrades for your armor and weapons some last  seconds some for the whole battle
all in all a lot of hack and slash funthe plot of this game is slim
all that you really do is umm let me think hack and slash and hack and slash
you run around buttonmashing so that you can go to the next level
even with all of the buttonmashing and hacking and slashing this game is still very fun and i would recommend renting it if not buying it
the lack of plot is easily made up for by the fun factor of the game
who knew that pushing x and o and stuff could be so fun
this game is definetly a game that i would reccomend to fellow gamers
the violence in this game is minimal because there is no blood and the bodies disappearthis was the very first game i purchased for the ps
it was out of a lack of better options at the store so i just decided on a whim to pick it up
when i first put it in the ps i was sorely disappointed at the repetitious gameplay and graphics that obviously didnt utilize the power of the pshowever after playing it for a while i soon realized how incredibly fun and addicting it truely was
the strategy involved was just so engrossing that i couldnt help but love the game
in addition the historical background they give you on all the characters and battles i found to be really interesting although i can see some just hating that sort of stuff
its a unique pace of gameplay and i think that if more people would give it a chance it could be massively successfuloh and btw its not an easy game either
as in all strategy games be prepared to lose a couple of times before you understand what to doalthough it isnt the best ps out there it certainly is an entertaining onei just bought a ps only a few weeks ago
my wish is that if i bought the ps last year i would buy fantasvision doa kessen dynasy warriors and much later on onimusha and devil may cry
however that all changed when i actually bought the ps
dynasty warriors was put on the backburner
and now i wish i hadnt
this is a great game
i knew of the history remembering romance of the  kingdoms the anime and the video game i believe it was for ps but it was totally different
when playing you barely care for the history other than yellow turban rebellion
ok i admit it
i didnt even understand the video
i dont play much in the way of action video games but i assume this is what it is categorized as
hack and slash definitely
it is so fun
i cant pull away from it thinking about trying to get as far as i can without dying
which is a pretty common occurance
maybe if i were darth maul id stand a better chanceits hard to choose what character to use
they all look wonderful and each have their strengths and weaknesses
some have speed some have strength some are good all around
you can notice this best when attempting to use sun shang xiang who is very quick
but it took me forever to take down  bad guys
on the other hand a musclehead like dian wei will take  baddies in less than  minutesas far as i can tell this is not an easy game to beat
it is easy to learn
there are four attack features though you heavily rely the fastest attack and the special attack
but there is the very special attack that you have to build up
i tend to use the extra special attack when fighting characters with an actual rank and name
sergeants and captains dont count were talking fighting other generals or when you are surrounded by multiple baddiesthat brings up another point
you get horded in this game
its not uncommon to get surrounded by some baddies
is it possible to beat em
oh yes it is specially if the rest of the army comes to help out
which is rather goofy because most of the other generals like to hang out and let you clear the areathe graphics are wonderful
control is pretty good though i cant tell if my aim is poor when trying to hit or the game is set up that you have to be a little more exact than just hacking and slashing
music is  its not what you would expect for an ancient chinese game
its not quite heavy metal but its like hard rockin tunes to get you pumped up
its the stuff you hear in segas daytonathere are some other goofy things that some people will criticize
it has been said that ps still has pop up
as in you cant see the end of the area you are in
misting is a form that the companies use to hide the fact that the machine cant handle the graphics of showing all the land
turok for the n did this and it was pretty cool
very eerie  the places i noticed it the most the mist was a part of the story
also there tends to be pop in of baddies too
you can be fighting and knock away  baddies then walk two feet and find another  or  appearing to take you down
its kind of annoying because you are really hoping to break out into the open
this isnt a big enough negative not to like the game nor is it a reason not to buythe two elements that i find most frustrating are that healing potions and saves dont come often
when they do they are grouped so close together that you dont need them
i wish there was a different save option because the campaigns give you  minutes to beat it
ive gotten the yellow turban rebellion under  minutes  healing potions are the same way they fly off the baddies five in a row  when you dont need them
by the time you do you are so far into the game you cant turn around and look for the crates or pots that might have them
it would be nice to stockpile the healers or at least find the general to heal youthis is an awesome game
of the few games that i do have for the ps i am impressed with all of them
even fantavision that everyone loves to hatethis game will not let you leave the control in the first day but you continue playing over and over you will get tired of the same thing killing enemies with one weapon
if your asking why did i give so many stars to this game this is my answer a game with good character levels and bad guys
also you have to fight against almost  bad guys per level its so hard and cool
but this game has not reach its highest point i hope dynasty warriors could be better than thiseven though this a fun game the fun wont last then for more then a weekend
i usually never like games of this genre but this one brought me in
you can choose between many characters
each has their own unique weapon including a sword a spear two daggers and a big spiked ball that can be usen in their own unique special move
it sometimes can be a little hard to find out where the action is
this is because the map is a little hard to read
but once you find the action it is nonstop
even though you have a whole army with you you do most of the fighting and this adds even more action because you are trying to fend off about ten enemies at a time
the graphics are brilliant
the enviroments are open and you can lead your army almost anywhere
there is a lot of tapping the quotcirclequot button in this game and it can get quite repetetive
i reccomend renting this game for a weekend when you have a friend over so you can kill the bad guys togetheri admit that it isnt as fun as quake iii when it comes to deathmatch but its pretty damn close
the graphics are a weebit better in qa but qa doesnt have much in ways of teamplay modes
if you like working on a team get this game
if you have a monster pc with a geforce or  for those willing to pay  consider also getting tribes  but back to unreal tournament this will last you a while since theres a crap load of levels and modes
i have had goty
edition for a little while i just beat quake  with somewhat ease on hardcore heh heh and i can just say same hasnt gone with unreal tournament
in conclusion quake  is the best for deathmatch but unreal tourney is best for everything else from ctf to assaulttoday with the arrival of unreal tournament  the original seems almost obsolete
however there is one advantage the original has over its bigger brethren
the system requirementsa pc required to run ut today would probably run you less than 
even at this price range the system requirements would probably still be over the needed limits
how times change huh
i know some people who remembers that ut was actually kind of difficult to run at the time of its release i was only a console gamer at the time so i didnt know
imagine years from now when doom s requirements would be considered nothinganyway as ive said before the biggest advantage to this is the low requirements
if you have a weak pc then you could simply opened up ut and get a quick fragging game on
you could play at maximum settings and still get fps for those who dont know that is excellent speed
as ut is meant to be a fast pace game this is extremely importantspeaking of which that is probably the main appeal of this game
the ultra fast pace of the game adds tremendously to its gamelength
supposedly ut was released as a competitor to quake ii but i had a chance to play quake ii later and i thought it was horrible compared to ut
hell i played quake iii later and thought it was horrible compred to ut
if youve played quake before then just take that and give it a few bottles of steroidswhile the pace is comparable to quake it is how you play it that makes it so much better
whereas many of quakes stages are often confining ut gives you large stages that lets you roam around with a shaky trigger finger
the stages add tremendously especially when you play deathmatch
that reminds me the game modes are great
while there are many game modes the two which are the best is probably deathmatch and capture the flagnow the speed and modes are great but there is more
online play and maps
there are always people fragging online so you never have to worry about lack of people to play with
this is great for when you have insomnia and want to stay up killing strangers online
secondly the downloadable maps are great
have a map from another game that you want to play
search for it online and you might find itin conclusion all of the aforementioned parts of ut gives it an extremely high replay value
highly recommended for people who likes fast pace games and like to have a quick fragging round every once in a while
not recommended for anyone who is disturb by mass bloodshed but for those who dont mind it go ahead and enjoyif your gonna buy armored core buy this one instead of armored core another age
this one has the tournument mode another age doesnt
i finished this game and got bored with another age and stopped playing itafter completing  of it
another age has nothing new from this one exept missionsi hear the new armored core will be like zone of enders
thers some plus sides to that but i will miss the  original be talked aboutwith the release of the ps i instantly picked up this game
its playability along with the ability to redesign your mech down to the last screw provided me with hours of enjoyment
it takes a while to get used to the control system and to master the in flight weapons battles that come out of most multiplayer battles
one definite advantage to this game is the ability to create multiple mechs and save them onto your memory card
after being saved there you can then go to your friends house that has a ps yes i know this doesnt happen yet but it will and the two of you can pit your mech designs against one another in the arenai would have to say that this game is a definite must for anyone that is into battle tech mechwariers earth siege or any of the other mech based combat gamessnapping your custom battle mechs together one piece at a time like a set of legos
sign me up
this game is easy to pick up and to be honest i dont even know what the story mode is about because i spend  of my time in the arena doing one on one fights with other mechs
its a lot of fun and because most people have never even heard of it the price is absurdly low
go ahead and pick up a copy
its a fun way to spend an afternoonwhen we got a playstation  the first ps game we put into it was armored core  by agetec
this game style is definitely one we enjoy a great deal
unfortunately it appears they rushed this game out the door a bit too quicklythe game design is really neat
like most mech games you start out slowly getting money to customize your mech as you go
there are  ranked robots for you to fight your way through as well as  missions to undertake to earn fame and fortune
there are hundreds of parts to choose from to customize your botyou can also go headtohead by linking your ps to a friends with the cable
unfortunately the ps doesnt currently support modem play so someone has to carry the unit to someone elses house to do thisthe plots are interesting  with three factions trying to get control of mars the missions you choose help influence the fate of these companies
the customization is almost overwhelming
you can customdesign your own logo with their built in paint program buy parts for a huge variety of systems on your mech and then test it out in various arenas against various foeswhy the disappointment then
the learning curve on this is very steep  the screens and layout could have been done much more intuitively
the game also runs extremely slowly
sounds lock up visuals will stick on the screen etc
if youve spent hours and hours if not weeks and weeks working on designing the perfect mech the last thing you want is for system failures to cause you to lose missions and die in battlesa true mech fan might overlook these problems and enjoy the game but those out to test the true power of their ps might want to look at other optionsthough the graphics are dated the action is so furious you wont notice it
what makes ac stand out is the arena mode which is missing from another age
and currently its cheaper on the used market than acyou can read any of the other reviews to hear about how it funtions but my personal opinion is that customizing your mechwanzercorewhatever is the real core of this game
during arena you dont have to pay for ammo or repairs
in the  missions you do
and some ammo is very expensive so youd want to use energy weapons rather than solid weapons like bullets grenades rockets missles etc
there are biosensors needed for radars at times
some heads dont contain those so you sell a head and buy a head
there is no penalty for selling you get the same amount of money as you paid
so youll constantly be swapping things outi had and still have lots of fun with this title
for  used a great gameps
my favorite antenna head big z core grenade gun dual vertical missles tank tread legs and rocket interceptors
yeaharmored core  is a fine addition to my ps library
it offers good graphics and sound and extremely fun gameplayyou will not be able to just pick up a controller and start playing
it takes a little bit of time to get used to the controls
once you do you are in a for a fun mech experiencethe thing i enjoyed most about this game is that i can choose either missions to complete or  on  mech battles to earn money to upgrade my mech
the  on  battles can be pretty tough
you will die a lot until you learn how to control your mech quite well
once you do you will still find some of your mech opponents to be quite challengingoverall this game is a winner and offers a unique yet fun style of gameplay that can not be found in any other ps game
mech fans will surely love this
all others should give this one a try as wellrecommendedi bought this game because i was looking for a nonsports title for my ps and wanted something with a little more combat than ssx excellent game  see reviews
im glad i read reviews of it before i bought it
armored core  is a very good game but it does have its flaws and there is a learning curve involved
some people may not want to take the time to get past the initial phase of the gamethe premise is simple  youre on mars and own a mech a remotecontrolled armed robot
mars is controlled by several corporations each with their own agenda and theyre looking for hired help to help them get what they want
that means you
you provide help by way of accepting missions
from time to time corporations will contact your advisor with opportunities
you can review the mission see how much it pays sometimes you get an advance and choose to accept or decline
upon completion of the mission youll get whatever portion of the reward youre owed as well as any bonuses you may have earned but you have to pay to repair any damage to your mech and you have to pay for ammunition that youve usedyou can also earn credits money and parts by beating other mechs in headtohead combat in the arena
the arena is a ladderbased challenge system  as you beat each opponent you move up one rung and receive a correspondingly larger bonus
you dont have to pay for damage or ammunition in the arenaheres where the work comes in
at first youve got a very basic mech
especially if youre not familiar with mech combat as i wasnt youll get beat in the arena or fail to complete missions
the expense of failing a mission is usually enough to set you back too far to continue so youll want to restart the mission
easy enough
think againthe game doesnt lend itself well to this kind of progress intentionally so i think
if you want to redo a mission you have to load a saved game save after every mission
 accept the mission and start over again
its not a quick process
then again it can still be done
in arena mode you can simply choose to fight the battle again and can do so over and over until you win although the losses are kept in your recordas you progress through the missions you get more offers your ranking improves you have a completion percentage based on how far youve gone and you learn more about mars the corporations and other things that are happening
eventually youll have a wellarmed mech and will be more able to do what you want
corporations will also make more parts available to you especially if youve been working for them so dont think youre limited to the weapons legs and other parts you see when you startafter each mission and arena battle you can take your credits and spend them in the shop
heres where agetec makes up for the missions  you sell parts back for  of the purchase price so you can experiment to your hearts content well maybe your wallets when you upgrade your mech
however you cant get everything you want
your mech has an energy limit and weight limits for the legs and the core and you cant spend more money than you have
if youre too heavy or cant afford required parts you cant go into battlethe control scheme is typical for mech games which means if you were expecting to use the analog sticks for movement youll be disappointed
in their defense this system is more realistic
after all if your mech has legs its not going to be able to spin around very easily
it takes a bit of getting used to and you need to know that the l and r buttons are the analog sticks  push in to use but once youve got the controls down youll be ready for battle
you can even use a usb mouse to design your emblem the logo for your mech and if youve got skills you can design a really cool emblemthe gameplay itself is good although if there are many missiles on the screen youll definitely see some slowdown
aside from that its nice once youve become accustomed to the controls and theres something satisfying about taking out a plane or a chopper with one wellaimed missile
its not all brute force though
youd love to be able to lay waste to a facility but when you finish the mission and get your bill for the ammo youll wish you were a little more conservativeyou can play headtohead against a friend either in splitscreen mode if youve got one ps or if you have two pss two tvs you each have the game and you have one ilink cable you can play on your own systemsthere are many different types of mechs you can build and the missions that you accept in theory steer your progress through the game ive not played more than one game so i cant verify that
i think the replay value of the game is pretty good if youre a mech player and im looking forward to going back and replaying some missionsive had a lot of fun with this game but ive also had to be patient with it
if youve got the time and if you like mech combat this is a good game for you
if youre considering this for a younger person or if youre new to the mech arena you may want to look for something elsegreat as it was initially for the original playstationthis was one of those rpgs that looked pretty cool to begin with but it is noti am going to give everything and number out of graphics sound gameplay value there were a few good things about it you can actually see what you equip on your character
like a vest or helmet
the other thing that was pretty cool was that it is realtime fighting so you could go around your enemy when fighting
everything else was mainly bad
overall there was not any thing really good about it and nothing really bad about itevergrace is a boring rpg title which was rushed so it could be a ps launch title
if it wasnt a launch title no one would have looked at it twice
basicaly they put their  out as a ps game because there was a small selection of  games and they thought theyd have a good chance of selling their game
bottom line skip
there is supposidly a mediocre sequel to this game with a different name
if you must play an evergrace game play thatthis game merges two of my favorite things on the world ancient japan and computer rpg
now that ive played it im forced to wonder why it took so long
with a market saturated with sword and sorcery type rpgs one set in ancient japan seems like a pleasant alternative
the similarities are obvious enough
ninja and samurai are cool enough to stand on their own along with the japanese derivatives of all those fantasy staplesone reviewer noted that the demo version doesnt do this game any justice
i totally agree with that statement
it was that review which prompted me to give throne of darkness a try
its unfortunate but the demo doesnt even scratch the surface and whether the makers realize it or not demos influence people to buy games
its almost better to have no demo than a poor or insufficient onecomplaints first the interface suffers from a lot of the things that diablo and diablo  suffered from in my opinion
supposedly the key creators of this game created the original diablo and you can tell
for the most part combat can be reduced to a furious cluttered clickfest devoid of any real tactics during battle
this is one of the reasons why i never learned to love the diablo games
compared to the baldurs gate series and all the black isle games diablo lacked any real rpg depth
clickclickclick level up clickclickclick boring
if it werent for a few saving graces throne of darkness would suffer the same fate but the devil is in the details something the creators went to great lengths to improve uponsecond i like creating my own characters from scratch and you arent afforded that opportunity with tod
with  samurai an obvious number to choose from its easy to forgive this slight
also statistically there isnt much to the characters
leveling up provides some variety amongst the characters but you can only put points in one of  stats so there isnt much strategy or skill to advancing
again this was another big flaw diablo had for me
compared to the fallout series and all the dampd based games there isnt much to the characters themselveswhile the major flaws of the game can be compared to diablo its the strengths that make it completely different and a far better game in my opinion
while the fast pace and constant clicking of diablo grows boring fast having  samurai in the party at any given time combined with a pretty sophisticated tactical editor provide a lot more variety than you would think
there are approximately  pregenerated tactical formations based on different animals turtle tiger scorpion etc
i find myself toying with them more and more to find that sweetspot
combine the different formations with the different combinations of characters and there is a lot more variety at play than at first glance
you can also manually create your own formations which you do by altering each characters personal stance which affects aggressiveness and weapon or magic assignmentone of the cooler aspects of the game is the daimyo interface
there are four daimyo in the game for you to choose from all of which come from the warring states period just prior to the unification of japan but thats where any real historical reality ends
the daimyo give orders resurrect characters and heal the injured while they wait
the daimyo also has a priest and blacksmith working for him which have a multitude of functionsthe blacksmith by far presents one of the coolest features of the game
in addition to fixing broken armor and weapons and the weaker weapons seem to break every  minutes he can also make new weapons and even customize weapons by combining them with strange objects looted off of creatures
theres actually more strategy to customizing each weapon to each character than you might think or at least theres as much as you put into it
there are items based on the four elements which enhance the items and then there are items that enhance the enhancements
you can spend hours finding combinations and can come up with some really cool itemswith seven characters to choose from at any one time over a dozen fully customizable formations and possibly hundreds of weapons to create combined with all that fastaction combat the only good thing to come from diablo this is already a game worth playing but its the whole japan angle that keeps me involved
i guess if you dont find ancient japan and things like samurai and ninja interesting or have never seen a kurasawa flick in your life you might not be attracted to this game
if you have its probably the biggest reason to buy it
the game stands on its own as a premier dungeoncrawler sorry there isnt much rpg involved here but replacing knights with samurai thieves with ninja and swords with katana ok technically theyre the same thing if youve never actually held one is what makes the game such a blast to playthrone of darkness is quite an addictive game
if you check the reviews it has received you might notice that there hasnt been too much buzz or hype about this game
this is unfortunate because throne is really a great game
i have found myself tied to the monitor early mornings before work trying to move my seven only four at any given time samurai warriors towards tsunaioshi the dark warlordthe graphics are truly beautiful
set if feudal japan the gamer must choose a clan with which heshe will set out on a journey that utilizes a gameplay quite similar to that of diablo
there is a slight learning curve to this game as it can become quite troublesome controlling the different abilities of four warriors at a time not to mention monitoring their equipmentarmor status for repairs
all in all this does not detract from a challenging and involving gaming experience is currently offering this gem for a meager amt which is a blowout price that should not be looked over
this game is guaranteed to provide hours of fun and frustrationenjoyactually i never play diablo ii
but i viewed the developers preview video
they sounded like studying the diablos very wellhowever the manual did not describe how to use those items to upgrade samurais weaponsarmors that the samurais pickup after killing
i just tried around
the graphics are pretty detailed and i like the audio as wellit is almost like aol  that i loved it so much
it is worth of your money and time even your sleeping timethis game has an even better and cooler story than all the final fantasys put together
but not as good as the diablo games
just missing by a decimal in a percentage rating
this game is sweet otherwise getting to choose from  characters from three calans n all
you get to use four characters at a time
three are being controlled by the computer where you are controlling one that you rotate using the space bar
the game is awsom if you like revenant another reccomended game or diabloi had a lot of fun with this game
while im not really into firstperson shooters this one actually delivered some great gameplay in a very unique gaming world
the game does have a few minor games however overall its easily worth the pricegameplay you pilot huge robots armed to the teeth and kill other robots similarly armed
period
there is a story line with the singleplayer campaign but its quite forgettable
the real fun lies in customizing your mech in the mechlab and getting to battle
there are  missions in the campaign and overall they are quite good
some of the missions are rather easy and you can finish them in a few minutes
others are very hard and will take several retries and an occasional lowering of the difficulty level for those of us who are not experts at mechwarrior games
the interface is pretty clean and useful and i was able to navigate just fine with my old microsoft sidewinder gamepad
unfortunately this games does suffer from the same minor but irritating problems of past games in the series
for example the mission briefings can still be vague and longwinded and sometimes youll have to play out a mission  or  times unsuccessfully just to figure out what youre supposed to do
also you cant save in the middle of a mission
this wouldnt be a problem if the missions were fairly short but many of them are not
finally ai opponents fight well and use good tactics but ai allies lancemates can have some pathfinding issuesgraphics the game looks very good even today
the mechs have good detail and the weapon effects are great
even the terrains are nice to look at
footage of human actors are used for mission briefings and the introductory movie is hollywood quality
some of the environments are destructible but not in a major waysounds the developers outdid themselves here
the sound effects are superb and very appropriate
also the soundtrack for the game is worth buying separately
voice acting is good but sometimes a little cheesy and over the top
overall the games sounds are done welltechical matters with the patch the game was very stable on my computer
it came with a very useful instruction manual as well
overall the singleplayer campaign lasted me about  hours
i dont think the campaign has much replay appeal but thankfully you can do player vs computer skirmishes under various conditions and play against other people onlineoverall mechwarrior  vengeance is a very good game and perhaps the best one in the series
its fairly easy to learn and is well put together
i recommend it to anyone into scifi gaming or shootersi was hoping for a mechwarrior game with all the bells and whistles
i thought it was going to be a major step forward
and from all the pictures i saw this even fed my hunger more
but now that i have it my first thoughts were this is it
the graphics have been improved a bit and the motion is a little clearer
but this is not a much of an improvement over mechwarrior  its basically just a revision you could even call it version   for anyone who hasnt played a previous mechwarrior game im sure theyll love it
i was just hoping for so much more and i just think that this game was rushed to get released before christmasi finally got to sit down and install then play mechwarrior vengeancei liked playing the last two incarnations of this game mechwarriors  and  and this game is a lot of fun too
the game play is pretty much the same you pilot a  ft tall walking tank called a quotbattlemechquot where you stomp through different environments blowing away anything that gets in your way in order to complete different missions
this whole concept started off as a board game believe it or not by a company called fasa now out of business  boohoo a long time agonow you get the full sensory effect
published by microsoft this version of mechwarrior is more plot driven than the others
you play the nephew of a powerful duke who returns to his home world from the clan wars to find it occupied by a rival noble family
your hop back into your battlemech and fight to free your home world
the graphics are great and the game is loaded with decent cutscenes that help move the plot along
your mech no longer lumbers along but really boogies down the road at a good clip
this makes piloting the mech a daunting task at times but it is a little easier thanks to the reworked user interface
also you can interact with your environment in different ways stomping people tanks and small buildings instead of shooting them up all the time
i am able to play the game enjoyably using a joystickkeyboard combination but you can also use a mouse if desired
i found it to be a pretty good battlemech simulation experience playing this game does require a good amount of concentrationhowever it is a microsoft game so it took a long time to install and you need a decent machine to play mechwarrior   it hasnt crashed on me but it does lag in spotsits not what i expected mw is becoming more action than simulation something the mechwarrior series was not meant to be
still its a good gameonce again the mechwarrior torch has been passed on once in the hands of activision for three gamesmechwarrior  then ghost bear legacy and finally mercenaries it was handed off to microprose who bumbled mechwarrior  on a rather grand scale
now that fasa has swallowed by microsoft as yet another franchise under their banner
that said mechwarrior  vengeance is a worthy successor to mechwarrior  and pigeon holes into the overall battletech story line perfectly
though that story line is degenerating thanks to bad writing in the form of battletech novels and rpg source material in the federated commonwealth of house steiner and house davion has been shattered pretty much guaranteeing that everything will return to the same old boring status quo of five successor houses squabbling over territorywhile mechwarrior  uses the basis of the split of the federated commonwealth the ignore the lunacy of lost technology and the inability to build new mechs
instead melissa steiner has ordered the execution of duke dressari of kentares iv and in a stunning opening cinematic which uses real actors and not cgi graphics we see the th donegal regiment lay waste to the defending forces
the only survivor of course is your character young ian dressari who was off world at the time who comes home to reclaim his birthright and to force steiners puppet dictator off the planet
ian is joined by a motley crew of freedom fightersfrom engineers to mechwarriors who aid him in his questthe single planet campaign is handled far better in vengeance than mechwarrior  because it really gives a sense of advancement as your loyalist forces move across the planet from region to region liberating key areas and securing resources
as time progresses you gain additional pilots with which to form a decent lance weapons and more battlemechs
mech design is also superior over mechwarrior  the d artists obviously taking their time to provide the best designs battletech has to offer lets face it many of the mechs in the technical readout volumes have been less than inspired
units themselves run the gamut from light recon all the way up ton heavy and assault mechs including some of my favorites like the mad cat timber wolf nova cat and the daishi
once i got the mad cat i pretty much stayed with it for the duration of the campaignmissions are fun and varied ranging from straight out mech melees capturing supply caravans even defending a coastal village from an sea strike from naval vessels
even grudge matches from villains that you meet via intercepted communications including your evil cousin who you must face in the last mission in a fight to death
and by the end of the campaign you have over  mechs to play with and hundreds of weapons including some weird creations that i have never heard of before like racks of medium range missiles light gauss cannons and something called a bombast laser
where i think it falls apart slightly is when you outfit your mechsin standard battletech any critical location big enough to hold a weapon can hold any weapon not so in vengeance
instead locations are assigned color codes and spaces
red for energy weapons green for missiles and yellow for ballistic weapons like machine guns and autocannons
plus grey for clan omnimechs which can hold any type of armament
additionally their method for grouping weapons is a little arbitrary and unless you have an advance joystick means youll be fingering repeatedly for the keyboard to fire other than your primary weapons groups
also recycle times on weapons is perhaps a little too long  seconds before you can refire a ppc up to  or  seconds for autocannons which plays up the importance of adding secondary and tertiary fire capabilities to your mech
i completed the game with a  ton daishi with twin clan lbxacs and a triple punch of clan lrms
this  punch combination meant i was smoking heavies and assaults in  shots
and because theyre very heat efficient weapons i could drop the number of heat sinks to increase armor and engine powerd graphics are a mix bag
a lot of terrain bit maps are quite good but trees look like cardboard cut outs seams can be seen where they laid down their textures for the ground and lighting effects are soso
the mechs themselves are beautiful have gorgeous movement that convey an awesome sense of power and weight
shadow effects of your mech seemed to be an afterthoughtlooking more like a dark t on the ground
your mechs search lights are next to useless shining under water terrain but not across it not that they help you see any better in night missions
the light amplification function also seems like an afterthought turning your field of vision into an eyesplitting green so save yourself a ton of equipment and avoid it
mech explosions missile con trails and weapons fire are firstrate
but dont get into the trap i fell intostay away from exploding mechs the backwash is a painall in all a solid effort from the folks at microsoft and fasa corp the solid game play backed up by a good story firt rate cut scenes all combine into a wonderful battletech experience
the full motion video cut scenes and briefings plus interplay between you and your lancemates only add to its success as a video game
if you like battletech and have at least enjoyed mechwarrior  then give this a try you wont be disappointedthe short great gameplay great engine excellent interface awful story and acting
a fine addition to the mech series of games
a solid stable fun game that doesnt require that you played any of the previous three to have a complete blast with itthe long i respectfully disagree with the review that gave this title one star because you cant make any mech into a supermachine
that is precisely what makes this game better than all the ones that came before it
i have played all of the mw games including the virtual world cockpit sims and this is the best yet
the game has been totally changed and by the fasa guys themselves from being just a computerized version of the paper game into a solid computer game that more accurately conveys what it should be like to be in one of these machinesthe shortcoming of the previous games was that mech models didnt matter
you could take any one of them and put in any weapons any equipment any armor
you were limited only by total weight so what was the differencenow there is a difference
the missile racks on a mech now really do have missiles in them or nothing and you can really hit those racks and blow them up
in the prior games you could hit a mech in the waist and it would count as a quottorso sidequot hit regardless of what the structure of the machine was supposed to be
now it plays far more like youd think the real deal should
two ton mechs are now completely different if theyre different models and you can play them with different tactics
you can use your knowledge of their structures to hit them where it hurts
shouldnt it have been this way all alonggame balance is totally different legs are way tougher to hit and to damage so you cant cheap out as easily with leg or even head shots
mechs accelerate decelerate and reverse faster so if you crash into somebody you dont ballroom dance with them at close range until somebody dies and the meltdown from a death at close range is now greatly to be avoidedvery cool you can break off easily and continue to run and gun
every mech battle is now the extended duel it should beno easy way out and no cheap argumentending superweapons like the ultra ac
now youve got to actually fight
if you dont like solid tactical fighting then go play any firstperson shooter ninniesweapon select and grouping is now totally different the hud is much simpler and more effective to use and the mech lab is equally simplified and effective
wingman command is perhaps the best such game interface yet invented very quick and it worksmissile play also is done right this time longrange missiles launch in an arc to the target shortranges are dumbfire and streaks always hit without needing a lock
other toys like ams and bap really work now and have a noticeable effect and advantage during play
the new way that the missiles launch in a rippleshower instead of all at once is more fun
this means that evasive action works
now rather than either getting hit with the full load or totally missed you can do things like dodge some and try to let ams handle some and everything in between
it also means that you need skill and strategy as a missile marksman which wasnt really the case beforethe mechs themselves have never looked better
theyre highly detailed distinctively blacken on damage limp stagger run walk recoil fall and die awesomely
the graphics look great
weapon effects are intense and the sounds are rich and throaty
you feel like youre dealing out some hurting even if youre only scratching paint when you unleash a machine gun
the ai is no longer dirtstupid puts up a great fight and wont sit there while you snipe from long range or pull other tricks that used to work
its much more equivalent to the great bot ai that you see in firstperson shooters like unreal tournament or quakethe singleplayer campaign is  full missions far longer in play time than mw
unfortunately the story is as awful as most other computer games
starcraft or halflife this is not
i cant remember seeing worse acting since high school so i cant give this five stars
its solid in just about every other way though
i look forward to any expansions that may be on the wayit is old and my dad gave it to me  years ago
many people like it
it is online and offline
it is a action and defense game so if you like action and defense then i suggest you try it
i like it because of all of the good graphics and because of all of the action that goes on during the game play
i also like it because when im offline it isnt challenging for me so i play it online and its more of a challenge because it is a real person
the game is mostly about customizing a mech how you want it to be
a mech is kind of like a robot
you can fight and gain allies
also i personally think campaign is one of the best options on the game
ive played the mechwarrior games other than number four and i also personally think number four is the best
its the best because it is a lot more realistic and there is more controls and there is a much better story line
a tip i have for you is if you are going to do campaign there will be story line videos
the tip is that you shouldnt skip the videos because it gives you tactics and enemies weaknesses
again i suggest you try itthis game has an awesome online multiplayer but the game itself is pretty boring
its fun in the begining but after you beat a few levels you just start to play the multiplayer
mechwarrior mercenaries is better in my opinioni loved the old mech
games and although this modern one is very much like them but with incredibly improved graphics something does not seem quite rightsomething emotional is not there  the old game was better or perhaps because it was a new concept it was fresh and excitingi highly recommend you get a demo and play it to see if you like it especially if you played the old mechps it is nearly impossible with a force feedback joystick every step the mech takes wrenches the stick about making it hard to hit a building let alone another mechbut perhaps a little short
on the easy difficulty setting i know i know i am wimpy i beat the game in  hours over  days and nightsbut the harder settings are challenging
graphics smooth clean looking if only my computer were fast enough to run it at its fullestgood graphisc and storyline and allbut gameplay is hard
but very impressive game and i reccomend it for simulation fansill admit racing games never held my interest much until the dreamcast came along
first metropolis street racer which was so amazing i decided to get test drive le mans as well
between these two im hooked big time
my thinking used to be quotlets face it how fun can driving really really fast around and around a track bequot  le mans caused me to eat my words before my first race was done
why
the graphics are dazzling even better than msr
the weather changes during the  hour le mans race yes  hours in real time if thats your thing from sunstreaked skies to a thunderous downpour
the time of day is gorgeously simulated as well  the sky slowly darkens and the full moon rises
this is the bestlooking racer there is no question
the controls are masterful  you can feel your car beginning to spin out and feel the weight shift as you barrel around hairpin turns
the thing i like the most however is the ai
each car up to  on screen at once
has separate ai so youll see them jockey with each other smash into walls and spin out on the grass
none of the perfect unchanging routes that made me hate racing games in the past
you actually have a chance of winning even if youre in the middle of the pack on the last lap
there are around  licensed cars to choose from all authentically rendered down to glowing brake discs and trails from spoilers and meticulously detailed
the reflection mapping has to be seen to believed
you can choose quick race which opens up all  reallife tracks championship opens up new cars and le mans offers the true  hour test or compressed
le mans also stays away thankfully from tinkering with your cars particulars all day
i just wanna race
however you can adjust fuel load and tire type which is quite strategical rather than a needless detail
the sound is also top notch with the exception of the somewhat generic music
however i cant quite give this  stars because after all youre still limited to driving around a track really fast no matter how beautiful it is and how well it controls
msr has more variety to its gameplay
however if you want the best pure racing experience gaming has to offer test drive le mans fits the bill to perfection
msr and tdlm finally fulfill the promise of bit systems beyond just prettier graphics and raise the standard that hopefully others will try to surpass
as a new racing convert i hope they dook now i could sit here and tell you this is the best game in the worldbut i cant the game play is awsome and the levels and guns are great but it lack in graphicsi have had a few problems with this game but nothing majori basiclly beat it in onedaybut you can change the setting for harder gamesi give this a  star because it only lacks in grapics and i like everything else about itif you dont mind ok graphics then buy this game nowbetter than quake  in one player mode
addictive and fun
of course the multiplayer is good too with  player split screen like goldeneye it is a party gameha i bought this after reading all the reviews and having this vision of myself piloting a plane through exotic lands
well if i got good at this game i might be able to do all that
getting through mission  has already driven me batty
took me awhile to figure out that i need to use a slower plane and that helped
it is a cool game i have no doubt about that
i think i lack patience perhaps but after crashing  times in a row and having to start the mission over i said a few choice words and put it away for awhile
dont let that stop you
if it was too easy  i would be complaining
if you have time to master this go for it
i know i will come back to it as it is now my mission to complete mission   i can get through  of the boulders but then it all goes downhill
plus landing is not an easy feat
there is a tutorial to teach you all these cool things and i tried it
i made it up to landing on the aircraft carrier
i just know that aircraft carrier moved around while i was trying to land on it
dont pay full price though it can be had for much cheaperif you like flight simulators this game is for you
i loved the graphics and the missions are challenging but i found myself bored with the game pretty quickly mainly because this just isnt my type of gamethe missions in the game were challenging but not overly difficult
learning to fly and control the plane was much easier than i expected
graphics were great just what you would expect from a pspersonally i like a good realistic dog fighting simulator much like microsofts combat flight simulator
this game reminds me of microsofts regular flight simulator with challengesif you like flying this game is definitely for you
if you are like me and looking for flying with intense action and the challenge of flying with crippled planes look for something elseill admit i had many doubts at first when i went to buy this game but i had heard some good things about it so i decided i would give it a try
well my doubts went out the window after just an hour with this masterpiece of a game by activision
sky odyssey is a flight simulation game just like pilotwings  but done much better
it gives you many modes of play at first such as target practice and landing pads
but the true fun and challenge is in the adventure mode
you are taken to a series of islands and told to complete certain missions like refuel your plane in midair or fly quickly through a small cave while avoiding falling rocks and wavy waters
before each mission you are given a specific tutorial so you know exactly what to do and how to do it
but believe me even with the tutorials these missions are very challenging and quite hard to complete under your given time limit
if you should finish your mission you are then given a grade and depending what grade you get you then get to choose one of many upgrades for your plane which will help you later on
it is really quite a innovative and cool system
and dont worry about replay value because there are plenty of missions the game has to offerthe different planes in this game are each very unique and neatly designed
as mentioned before they are all upgradable in areas such as their wing engine propeller landing gear and more
and for you aspiring artists out there the game even has a drawing program where you can draw your own symbol on the back of your plane
the target practice and landing pad parts of the game should be used by beginners as they are good places to practice all of the flying skills with all of the planes
the control of these planes takes some getting used to and is best when you have an analog playstation controller
once mastered you wont be able to wait for your next chance to become a virtual pilotmy only problem with this game is the graphics
the weather effects are excellent and utilize the pss power very well but on the training lessons and some parts of the main gameplay the graphics can get pretty bland and boring
a touch couldve been made here and there to better enhance the whole flying experience
this is the only reason i didnt give the game a perfect score
but as long as a game has solid gameplay it usually hardly detracts from the whole experienceall in all id have to say this is one of the most original challenging and fun games ive played in a long time
if you have some extra cash and are lucky enough to own a playstation  i would highly recommend this game
unless you really dont like flight simulators there is something in here for everyone
definately one of the top games for ps this yearmany of the games on the ps at this point have dazzled with eye popping graphics but have had lackuster gameplay
sky odyssey does just the oppositethe graphics in sky odyssey will not dazzle you
it seems like this could have been done easily on an n
although the graphics are not up to ps standards the extremely fun gameplay will keep you coming back for more and moreactivision did a great job laying this game out
the levels are challenging creative and a whole lot of fun
the gameplay can be a little slow paced at times but the varying missions and levels prevent any boredom from repetive gameplay
the controls are quite good and very easy to get used tothis game has the feel of rogue squadron on n however instead of shooting at tie fighters your challenges lie mostly on flying and landing your aircraft throughout some tricky terrains caves tunnels storms etcthis game can only be played to be appreciated
it was a pleasant surprize for this ps owneri highly recommend picking this one upisnt it a wonder how fast computer games can evolve
i remember buying pilot wings on the nintendo  and being amazed but now things have moved on we now hace sky odyssey
the concept is pretty much the same as pilot wings but with more modes of play
you can just fly around for ages for amusment which is something that i have been doing for a long time as i cant believe how good the graphics are
this is a good game to have as its so different to what is around at the momentive played the other versions of knockout kings on other systems ps n etc
 so i just thought that this game would simply be a graphically enhanced version of the other games
but its much much more than that
for starters the graphics are top notch
the differet knockdown animations the way that the faces of the fighter change throughout the fights and the textures of the boxers themselves are simply awesome
graphically this game has no weakness at all
backing up the great visuals is great sound with actually a wide variety of music that might suit many different tastes
but the most important aspect i feel is gameplay
the problem with the other boxing games was that they dimply werent deep enough and quite honestly got pretty predictable and boring after a while
that isnt the case here
theres actually lots of strategy involved and there is an element of surprise in different matches that prevent the game from getting too predictable
there are also a great number of different modes that will keep you playing this game for a while
in all honesty i think that youll definitely get your moneys worth with this game
i give it  stars
buy this one with confidenceea sports did a good job with this game but it could have been better
first some positivesthe game is very realistic
it has real boxers cornermen and referees
the game has fighters in every weightclass including the women
the punches need to be timed and you just cannot go into the ring versus a good opponent and start pushing buttons
the crowd looks good and the graphics are terrific
the movement of the boxers is also realistic
there are different fighting modes and levels of play
the easy is way to easy and the normal gets too easy after you become powerful in the career mode
the fight commentators are good and they dont repeat themselves like in madden
now the negativeswhy does ea allow you to beat this game in the career mode
i had a record of  and was able to beat the game
like madden you should be able to box until you want to retire
all the great boxers have at least  wins and you are forced to retire after   the game should not end so soon
also in the career mode none of the other fighters record changes but yours
it seems as though you are the only one fighting
they should have it so you schedule your fights and the other fighters win and lose as time goes on and everyone gets reranked so it is harder to climb to the top
even after you beat someone the loss does not go on his record
also in the career mode you become too powerful too quickly
you are given training points after you train between fights
the training points determine how good of a fighter you are by determining things such as your speed quickness stamina recovery time ease to cut etc
however the training points are too easy to get and too many are given out at once
i had  in every category my nd to last fight and i was invincible
you should have to fight some fighters twice so you can get more victories and you become powerful slowly
after you move up in ranking you cannot rechallenge anyone lower than you even if you had a close fight
an annoying part of the game is that the announcers and referee mouth does not move as they talk
also the ref is not in the ring as you box you just hear a voice
also walking out you dont have a robe on and there is no one around you
a huge mistake in the game is the training mode
your sparring partner cannot hit you with the hook so you are unable to block it
also it is nearly impossible to throw the cross low hook combination
you lose training points because you are unable to do certain things in training mode and the computer doesnt recognize that it is making the mistake
and the main reason why i give the game  stars is lack of button recognition
sometimes the game does not recognize the buttons you push especially when you have to push  buttons at once
all in all i think it is the second best title for ps but far behind madden
i think it is defintely something you should buy but ea has to make some improvements
and for the person who said ready  rumble  is more realistic are you kidding me
no one should ever listen to that persons opinions about games
ko kings is based on realism
ready  rumble is supposed to be fun and comical not realistic
and that is what it accomplishes
again i would recommend that you buy the game it is a good one for a serious gamer who likes realistic sport games
and for those of you looking for some tips
the secret to be successful against a good opponent focus on hitting the body
use your jabs and crosses in the first few rounds to the body
you will notice that when you hit him in the stomach during later rounds he stops to cover up
this is when you let lose to his head by throwing you specialty punch or strong upper combination
in the th and th rounds you can hit him in the body and it takes away a lot of power and sets up the knock out
or if the fighters cut rating is low circle and jab and doublejab to the face
by the rd round you should have him opened up and you can focus on landing combinations and jabs to the eye so the doctor stops the fight
what not to dodont go in the ring trying to throw a bunch of uppercuts and knockout blows good fighter will eat you alive
set up combinatins with the jab and blocking shots
the best way to knock someone out is going to the body and when he covers up go the head
the combinations starting at the body and working up is effective while the boxer is in the corner
you should always keep the person against the ropes by standing back and just throwing jabs to the face and follow up with combinations to the body when he covers
to beat the game you must learn how to defend yourself
use l and l a lot
if you slip by a punch you have time to throw a jab and combination but watch out for combinations you dont want to let go of the l buttons too early and get caught with the follow up punch
and dcritique opinion is always reliableboxing hits ps with a bang
this game is excellent
its got lots of real boxers and even mills lane stepping into do some reffing
ea sports has looked into every little detail
the boxers look great even thier faces look just like them
they also show damage over time by bruising and some times cuts even open up and blood gushes as you get hit
the new combo system is the best in any boxing game ever which adds lots of depth to gameplay
also its cool that some dirty moves have been added like elbows headbuts and kidney punches to name a few
but dont abuse them or the ref will penalize you
this game only fails in two places
first the training mode  although it teaches you the basics it is very boring and second there is a small load time between rounds
these two things keep it from being a five star gamei have a kid who is rough on controllers
he has a disability
they are sony and i would accept no less
out of the two controller i bought one has a thumb controller with a tilt
sometime i get unopen boxes brandy new and other times me and my boy get ones that are prebroken
i would recommend this site if the price is rightwe have three ps systems as well as psone ps systems and multiple windows systems and even a multitap for  controller play
im just saying we use our game controllers and have lots of experience with them
we have plain controllers such as this one rapidauto fire from the manufacturer and modified ps autorapid fire controllersover the years weve purchased at least  of these controllers since i prefer to buy the sony brand for the game consoles unless we need something special like rapidauto fire
in the case of windows machines we buy logitech and also logitech for wireless ps controllersthese sony controllers are double edge swords because they wont last
none of them last more than say  to  months and some die in the first month
buying from amazon directly is great because they stand behind what they sell
thus when my son was replacing a controller that die after all most  years we came back here
the one we got was flaky from the start he tells me and two of the keys died completely after less than  days
the new controller we got is rock stable and looks like another  to  year model
hey for  or so what can you expectof course the ps version especially the modified ones cost a lot more and theyve been holding up longer now over  years but they dont work on the ps systemsbottom line  i highly recommend buying this controller if youre looking for a good basic controller but beware they are great but dont have a long life span at least in a family of game playersanything to say to the one of the best controller ever designed
i purchased a pair of it to replace a couple older onesits only a controller there cant be that much difference
i dont feel comfortable getting the cheap underground rd party controllers
these controllers are pretty durable
i once kicked out after failing another license exam in gt and my foot got hooked in the wire
i fell over and the controller went flying
the part that plugs into the port hit the wall and bounced off and now it rattles a bit but its fine
i really like the feel of the controller in my hands
the internal rumble is great its nice and quiet unlike n and you dont need bulky attachments
the part of the controller past r and l hooks over a little bit a subtle addition but important so you can brace your fingers against it to push the buttons harder
i think this controller is worth the pricethis is an easy to store controller and long cord so theres no need for a wireless controller
it comes in diff colours so its coolthis is a great controller if you are one who sits really close to the tv
if you sit far away from the tv everyone in your house will probably trip over it
its happened to me many times
if you got this controller with the ps keep it as a backup but you should invest in a wireless controller
it will prevent catastrofic accidents
it is however easier to use than a wireless controller because sometimes on the wireless ones the buttons are harder and dont work as wellthe bottom line is that you need controllers to make the system work
thats pretty simple and obvious
so just buy the ones that are made for the game system itself because they are just better
plus then you dont have to have a big fight every time it comes down to whos going to have to take the crappy controller
it will save bloody noses and bad excuses from people who get beat every time anyhowon the other hand r is the most ridiculous button ever made
its about as useless as scroll lock button on your computer
its just not in the right place to be used well at all
sony needs to come up with some better idea for the position of that button
other than that the controller works well
if you r fed up with the button placement then try  something elsethis is a much better controller than the dual shock  so if u got a few extra bucks get this onehasnt broken down yet but my others of the same brand have in the past
simple controllers
the default that comes with the systemheres the scenario
i buy a ps and the controller that comes with itduelshock breaks after a while
i notice that i still have a ps duelshock so i use it until i buy another duelshock  but then it hits me the duelshock one does the exact same thing but is a lot cheaper
dont be fooled
the only reason the duelshock  contoller is more expensive is because it says  as in playstation  if you have to get a new controller just get the psone duelshock because you have no reason to pay  bucks for the ps duelshock
its all in the name folks
i gave this a four and the psone controller a five just because of the price difference plus the psone controller i was using temporarily is still working unlike that ps controller that came with the ps i boughtthis is great the functionality ergonomics everythingjust prefer wireless though so thats what i usually getthere are a lot of other controllers at cheaper prices but this one is simply the best
the buttons hold out longer the rumble feature is quiet compared to the cheaper knockoffs and you cant just have the one controller that your ps came with because eventually you and a friend are going to want to play a twoplayer game
it just makes sense peoplethis controller would be perfect except for the fact you can wear it out
it works well and is an upgrade from play station one for sure
this controller takes a bit of time to get used to but once you do it is far superior to other controllers out there
above averagejoseph dworaktheplaystation  dualshock controller blackis simply a must own devices for those who are purchasing ps bundles this holiday season
while some newer generation game systems have controllers that have improved slightly or added functionality for the ps this original controller is still one of the better options
and since unfortunately sony has only included  controller with most bundles you will inevitably have to purchase an extra controller anyway
so it might as well be the one the system was designed withthere are other color options available such as blue
those with special white bundles may have a tougher time finding an extra white one to match
regardless in terms of utitliy thi is a unit that must be added
theres nothing more annoying than not having an extra on hand when guests arriveso if youre buying one of the holiday ps bundles pick one of these up as wellenjoyso far i have had  no problems with this sony ps   controller the only draw back is it should have been longerif by any chance you are a hardcore multiplayer action lover and your ps only came with one controller how will all of your friends play and most importantly how will you show off your skills
the answer is simple buy another controller
there are many different colored dual shock  controllers ranging from the basic color blacks to blues to ones that have the hulk or wolverine painted in the front between the joysticks
usually however the cooler looking ones cost a bit more and a picture on the front of one wont really entertain your friend for a long while
a basic black one like the one found on this page is my recommendation
the controller features the basic ps buttons a directional pad two joysticks and four buttons with shapes on them as well as  extra buttons on top of the controller
a ps controller is much easier to master than an xbox controller and it can fit into both a  and  year olds hands
it doesnt weight much and can easily be around
the wire that leads from the controller to the connector to the ps is longer than the original ps controller meaning you can be a lot farther from the tv and still play
a definite need for all multiplayer needs however if you prefer playing singleplayer games then dont bother buying thiswhen you just pick up the sony manufactured ones you can just feel the quality in the weighttheres supposed to be a lot of technology with the analog buttons it detects how hard you press the buttons and such in these controllers but in all honesty not a lot of games actually utilize this as of now however thats not to say you should go get the old dualshock controllers
metal gear solid  sons of liberty is supposed to take full advantage of the analog buttons and all of the other neat gizmos on the controller that no other game doesthese controllers also last much longer than your average rd party controller
ive never had a sony controller break or wear down on me so trust me your money will be well spent on thesethe triangle button is a little sticky
i would have exchanged it but i didnt get a chance to use it and find out until it was too late to returni really like this control it feels very well in my hands
ive had a few of these because my little brother would always break them by throwing them to the floor anyways a few weeks ago i found a box full of ps games that i had put away a few years ago when i saw some of the great tittles i really felt like playing the ps again but i didnt have a control so i bought one for about  and it works great just like the old ones anyways i recommend this productplaystation controllers hav always been the best then they made the dual analog
i honestly feel a bit weird going back to the oiginal
when ps came out they made a dual analog  the analog sticks have been perfected to the perfect stiffness and buttons are now pressure sensitiveeverything about this controller is perfect except the price
 bucks is a lot to pay for a controller
unfortunately the only alternative is a rd party controller
some of them are ok others just plain  i try to avoid them all because they are very unreliablethis controller is very easy to handle and feels comfortable in ones hand
the analog sticks make running a lot easier then pushing the directional button
the vibration function is available also if you like a little exta jolt of excitementits the default ps and ps controller but in black
if youre like me you model your audio video equipment and furniture after batman
i have black stereo equipment black tv vcr dvd player and a black ps
my stereo stand tv stand and speakers are all black as well
a black ps controller means business
its not a quottoyquot like the beige ones its black
just like batman
we all know that batman is cool and with the black ps controller you can be cool tooi have used these controllers for several years on both the ps and the ps
the products are durable
one lasted for about  months and the other has lasted for about two years
my replacement controller for the  month guy is doing awesome
the buttons are pressure sensitive which is cool and the rumble feature brings you a little closer to the gametrust me these are good controllers but they are not designed to be thrown around
they will break much more quickly if you abuse themat first glance sonys dual shock playstation  controller is just a black version of the original standard controller with analog sticks
however upon extended play one will notice some differences
the materials the dpad and buttons are made out of are not the same and they are set further down into the controller
after a while the dpad becomes loose something that did not happen with the standard controller and the buttons become softalmost mushy
the result is more difficulty while playing games that require precision timing movement and simultaneous button pressing
the analog sticks are of decent quality though not quite up to par with the newer xbox controllers
while i usually despise using any kind of analog stick i have found some games actually work well with it
for free roaming games that require you to move in all  degree directions they are surprisingly useful like gauntlet dark legacy or ecco the dolphin
despite my complaints the dual shock is still a great controller for general use in any ps game
casual gamers probably wont even notice its flaws
even though the analog sticks seem to serve no other purpose than to get in my way while playing my favorite fighting games its leagues better than the standard dreamcast controlleri remembered the good old days when i used these controls to play my ps games
brings back old memoriesthe feel and vibration of the dual shock controls
its nice to use them again to play with those gamesjust a few notes about the ps and the different controllers this controller is expensive kind of nuts considering that the system has been out quite some time and i don think the price for anything except for some of the really terrible games like unreal and orphen have dropped third party controllers break ok all controllers can break but third party controllers seem to wear out a lot faster im talking within a few months whereas ive had a ps for a year and all the official controllers i got at the same time as the system and they still work great i havent run into a multiplayer game yet that does not like the ps dualshock
ive been told that some games will not allow the ps controllers but i havent seen it yetclassic controller for ps
the dualshock controller is a great controller design and they are built to last
i gavr it four stars because the one that came for me was broken on arrivali thought that this would work for original playstation games too but it doesnt and thats okay
i still love iti cant believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than  dollars
you are being ripped off if you have to pay more than  dollars for one but unfortunately if you live in the country like me finding a store nearby selling playstation  memory cards would probably be nearly impossible
so youre forced to shop for one onlineits really not cool to have to pay all this money just to save the progress in my video game
its really dumbyou need at least one of these if you are going to own a ps
dont buy the nonsony brand cards they can have problemsthere is nothing wrong with buying them used the old information can be erasedand you wont need two of them unless you eith own a lot of games like more then  or if you like to rent a lot of different games to try them out firstif you plan on having any fun on your ps you must get this
though sony needs to make a larger one maybe mb to keep up with nintendos  blockabout mbthis memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced
i didnt have to worry about this because mine came with my ps
it can hold about  files thats about  file for each game
if you have over  games like me you should consider getting the value pack that comes with  memory cards
if you buy two of the black ones it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused
the value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusngit is a must if you own a ps to save your games
i own two and have no problems with them
it is as it says at a new low price so it is a good time to buy onethis official sony memory card works reliably straight from the package
generally it is best to plug the memory card in prior to turning on the game system
the mg memory card is large enough for most avid gamersthis memory card works for me i like it
i can put alot of games on it
might but more laterthis memory card is very reliable for keeping information unlike the other crappy memory cards out there
i think it is absolutely great but for a high price howeverthe price is insane
amazons prices are very reasonable compared to any others
most of the stores in my location sell these badboys for  dollars even more than a controller costs
some really nice stores will give you a morethanreasonable price such as movie gallery which will sell for about  dollarsi have never been a sports game fan so i have never had problems with my memory card being full
most of the games i own take up about  bytes which is of course very good
sports games however take up most of the memory card causing more thinning of your wallet to buy even more memory cards for insane prices
my friend has quite a few madden games thus he has about  or  memory cards costing him about the same price as his playstation these memory cards are perfect i love them but the price is just not right
they hold a very fair amount of space but sport games overdo itthis card isnt subject to having a block size unlike the ps cards which means that you can put over  save files on it easily unlike the ps card that took one block for one save no matter how big or small the save file was
sorry but there is not much really to review herethis memory card is essential in order to save your ps games
a ps memory card will not save ps games and viceversa
even though it only holds information for  games its good to know that your memory card wont fail becase it is good quality
a musthave for any ps ownerendi havent heard about the rd party memory cards but from experience those will inadvertantly erase your games
yup and im not kidding either
even though most of my cards are rd party i own one of these for my quotsuper important save gamesquot theres a huge chunk reserved for ffx xi and xiiso much like an insurance policy get this and you wont ever have to worryall you need to know is that this is a card that will save your progress on ps games
with plenty of memory you can take it to someone elses ps and load your progress onto it instead of internal memory which is just stuck to its own consoleits a card with memory you dont need to read a review about it do youwhat can i say
it a memory card
do not get a playstation without one of these
stupid me i got my playstation without a memory card big mistake
you need one of these to save
the price is a little high but it saves a lot
get onethe ps memory card isnt bad it as stated before lacks the ability to save ps titles and vice versa but that is ok i guess
ive never had any problems with these memory cards myselfand i own and have used alot of these cardsthe ps cards however ive had some corruptions for no aparent reasoni dont pull the memory cards out while the system is on or anything
glad it was fixed in the newer cards thoughnice memory card wish it had more memory but thats cool because they make a mb memory card you can buy from best buy
reliable and has quick savesi have to say the gameplay is helped so much by this fairly inexpensive addon that it seems odd  maybe even dishonest on sonys part that it was not built in
with the card which fits neatly  easily into a slot built for it on the front of the ps not only does the action flow more smoothly such as the delay time for new levels of grahpics to load but games can be saved for later play
its a musthave just too bad you have to pay extrawhen i say this is expensive im referring to the list price not amazons price some places even sell it for  bucks
now that ive cleared that up lets talk about why this is not only essential for your ps but why its so much better than the one we got on the psonefirst this memory card has kb of space
i dont know about you but that single memory card has lasted me longer than any psone memory card which i had to buy four of because that was only  blocks
the second best part is that some games can save more than one file without taking up any extra space
some games create a file soley for the game on the memory card and i can save  different files no problem
so you wont have to purchase a second memory card anytime soonsports games and socom  can use quite a bit of space though
some sports games can use up  of the memory card so watch for that
still youll only use that amount once
socom thats a different story
that takes up more than kb just thought id warn yathe problems
well of course theres the list price
i only need to pay  for my controller so why would i want to pay nearly  for the memory card
again im referring to the list price not amazons price
i think the price at amazon is quite fairthe second problem is that you cant save psone data onto these cards
a psone game wont even read them
yet you can still copy data from a psone memory card to this not a good idea though because you can screw up your ps memory cardif you want to enjoy your ps youll have to buy this otherwise forget saving and all that stuff
its a good investment at leastthe goodkb of space and im still on my first onegames dont take up that much spacethe baddoesnt save psone gamesthe list price is kind of highthese memory cards work excellently
i have two and the only problem is the high price
i am glad to see the price has started to come down
it is pretty bad for sony to still be going the memory card route but you have to get one and this is the besti have had the mega memory cards and they are great at first
then you start deleting information and moving stuff around and the mega memory packs just start falling apart
just play it safe and get this bad boyi like it it gets the job done but it is kind of priceythe memory card does what it was designed for saving your game progress
it works just fine
nothing more nothing lesseven though i am slightly annoyed with the fact that you have to own a memorycard in order to get the full outcome from you ps i think that the memorycard from sony is very goodthe saving and loading of games of games are very fast and i havent experienced any problems at all with any of my games
besides the speed on the memorycard it has plenty of space for lots of savingsgames are so much more fun when you are able to save your progress so i guess that when you have decided to buy a ps you really need a memorycard as wellthe only reason that my rating is only four stars is that i think that it should be possible to save games on your ps without having a memorycardits good and cheap gamestop carged  me  bucks but amazon only charged me  its great just in case you  wondering what it is it saves your game progress on psthe mb memory card gets the job done but it is very necessary if you want to enjoy your ps
if you are planning on buying many games then you will need two
im on my second card already so if youre a heavy gamer plan on running out of memorysome negatives though are the price and the packaging
so expensive
amazon has a good price though
ive seen more expensive
i guess sony jacks up the price since you need it if you want any enjoyment out of your games any of themand you wouldnt believe how hard the packaging is
you need a grown adult with flexable hands to get the card out
be careful because kids might cut themselves on the plastic or might get migraines from trying to figure out how to get the memory card out of the packagehowever the memory card gets the job done and is pretty reliable
ive had my first one for about  months and i havent had any problemsacessories for ps may cost you more than you bargained for
i ahve no problems with the memory card
it works great  its sony i am not satistfied with the fact that the ps games needs the ps card so for us who did not own ps but now wants to play them on ps must buy a ps card strange
i expected better form a electronic giant like sony with the best available technolgies at hand sony did not pass on that kind of convenience to their consumers so we feel it in our pockets that not fair
this is not a game
this is purely about profits for sony i think that everything should get better with time and the games acessories sorftware for the ps has not laterzzzz gamers  folksit gets madden in some ways and in other ways it pales in comparison
the standard modes of play are therepreseason season tournament and gm mode thats franchise for all you madden fans
the gm modes okay but i like the madden ones better
first of all when you go to sign a free agent they already have the terms for each player set upthe years they want to play and the and the salaryno negotiating
either you sign them or you dont
another feature i hate is the fact that you cant trade players for potential draft picks which they do in the real thing all the time as well as on madden
speaking of potential draft picks the offseason isnt detailed enough
all you do is draft then sign the people you drafted without negotiation
the beginning of each season though the new guys sort of try out and try to make your cut in preseason games
madden doesnt have this feature
the rest of the game is straight
the menu screens are all expensive looking
you know like fox sports
the sound features lots of good commentary
but like all sports games that do a halfhazard job of working on it theres not much and it gets repetitive
the controls are the gameday controls always were confusing which adds a learning curve to a football game of about an hour
but its probably a good thing because of the total control passing which allows you to overthrow and underthrow passes and you can do powerful diving tackles be sure to align yourself straight or youll miss the guy
these complex controls also assist in giving you endless possibilites on the running side of things
the graphics are pretty good
the pro talk feature is pretty good cause the mouths move with lipsynched speech
the models look rather funny because the linesmen and linebackers are really wide and broad in a pretty bad attempt to recreate those pound monsters
i like the createaplayer feature because you dont acutally work with the attributes once you create them
you change their abilites to complete training tasks yard dash vertical leap bench press and based on those values the player is rated
if you dont like them you can go back before the player is complete
you can also create what they call a quotsuper playerquot where you combine the abilites of star players to get a guy with at least an overall rating of about  or so high
all in all this games pretty good
somehow it trails closely behind madden but i dont think itll catch upif you can say anything about this title it is that everything is quite improved
there are more cars to steal and actually hijacking them is so much easier than the first game
you get lots more weapons and they are easier to find this time
the missions themselves are much more exciting than in the first game so you will always be on the edge of your seat
the openended gameplay allows you to complete the gang missions in any order making it easier for the average gamer
however the cities are not a big as their playstation counterparts
there is still no bloodgore so the adult feel of the game is lost
driving the actual cars is very much unchanged but the music is better this time around
an excelllent game for the driving genre but not reallly adult enough to convey the crimespree feeling of the playstation versionsgta is a good game and quite addictivethe graphics are excellent
plus there are lots of vehicles to borrow
also there is not as much foul language as there is on the psone or windows versions
but the down sides are the controls are difficultthe music gets annoying
the levels are long and drawn out
if you crash into something it takes a while to get out and sometimes you cant even drive out
in the end grand theft auto  is a great game and i would suggest that you should purchase it asapthis game is quite good as beatemups go
it has a good cast of characters and i really only dislike a couple of them
the graphics are pretty darn good and the fighting styles excellent
there are several varieties of game play and alot of replay valuethe only things that i do not like are the story mood is disjointed and way to short
it never goes into any of the characters in any deapth and only offers bizarre one line comments throughout the gameand  the bouncing aspects of the gals needs to be more
if you are in for a penny go in for a pound
this game is for an older audience anyway so add more bouncefor months doa on the ps was competing for my attention with quotsoul caliburquot for the dreamcast at the office
sc is surely more approachable easier to get good at and has better extras but da has a fighting engine that is arguably superiordoas controls include a button called quotfreequot which must be understood and mastered before this game can be any fun at all
while used for sidesteps and movement into the foregroundbackground a trigger press also accomplishes this the main point of quotfreequot is to do quotholdsquot which allow you to reverse an opponents attack and hurt himher much worse than heshe was going to hurt you
to hold a midlevel attack just press free and back
high and low attacks are held with free and diagonal backs on the dpadit takes a long time to get the hang of this but it is incredibly rewarding once youve done so because it eliminates the quottennis matchquot style dailyradars term prevalent in so many fighting games  one player unleashes a combo the other player retaliates etc
instead you can dismantle the combo when it begins or sometimes halfway through
attackers can no longer use easy goto moves on every series because the defender will see it coming
instead you have to conceal your style or widen your offensive pallettethe game also makes use of the arena  instead of quotring outsquot ending the match as in soul calibur two things can happen to an unlucky defender whos run out of room
they may get knocked to a different level of the environment sustaining damage or they may be knocked into a hazard like an electified wall taking heaps of damageas wed expect from the ps the visuals are sumptuous
facial expressions in the storymode closeups are creepily realistic at times even given the usual anime stylingsstory mode is a ridiculous mush of character moments and melodrama  suitably quothardcorequot single players may just want to play survival mode repeatedly to skip the incoherent babbling
as youd expect playing against real people is much more fun particularly the fourplayer tagteam although youll need to spend  for extra controllers and a multitap to try itwhats not to like
well the characters have a certain sameness to them although that may be a design choice to avoid the cartoonishness of other fighting games tekkens ogres giant pandas and wooden men are nowhere to be seen
also the overt cheesecake factor may be offensive to some although it is at times so overthetop that you have to think the developers are pushing outrage for outrages sake
and if you dont understand that unlock a few of tinas costumesa very fun game with many different modes
story mode vs time attack tag battle survival sparring etc
you may think it has little replay value but you can still unlock more costumes for the characters and things like that
its definetely a fun game
i really dont like fighting game that much but i rented doa  and i loved it
i definetely am looking forward to doa if released on ps
the graphics are great except for pss lack of anti aliasing and very smooth
if you arent sure though just rent itdoa hardcore is one of the better fighting games on the ps but like all fighting games it has its draw backsthe graphics are excellent almost perfect
no shady pseudo dimensional graphics that when you get too close they become a flat surface
the fights can go almost anywhere from down the side of a mountain to out of a dojo to down balconies at the opera housethe tagging options are phenomenol
the tag moves are not only impressive but just plain out fun to watch
and even the singles story mode is impressivethe only reason im docking this game a star is because the endings for a lot of the characters are about as entertaining taking  thumb tacks ya got em
ok
now that you have those thumb tacks put them in your eyes and close your eyelids
the endings just didnt do it for me
a  second boring spot with your character doing something stupid ex zach snowboarding down a hill
please
other than that get this game and have at it
have funthis is a great game great graphics sound movment and action but after playing it for a while by yourself gets a bit bores but if your going head to head with a mate it is real fun becuase it gets more complicated than fighting with the computer so if you only have one controller go to the store and buy one now and call your friendsmy kids wanted a fighter
after playing the tekken  demo my daughter fell in love with the genre
i bought doa simply because it was the cheapest one i could find used for the ps while tekken  was on order
we were very pleasantly surprised
i will very briefly hit three points pros cons and the prior knocks on the game
i will leave the technical stuff for others to fight overthe engine is smooth and the graphics while not up to the present standards are very good
the move list is fairly large
the actual fighting system flows in a natural way and is great for a beginner
it has pretty much the standard modes and difficulty settings
the training area is adequate
the time and survival modes are very fun and add longevity to the game
compared to the prior games i had tried either in the arcade or on the ps one there is very little in the way of blood and gore and disturbing images besides two people beating each other up of course and from what i have seen is the most toned down in this regard
overall my kids love the game and it is just a lot of fun to playon the down side the stories are virtually nonexistent and the story mode is very short and you can finish it all in a day or so
there are only two unlockable characters and otherwise you are playing to unlock extra outfits which my kids find fun but i find a bit dullas for the prior hits this game has taken as aimed at yearold boys it may be true
the women are well endowed but it is not a pervasive element of the game
after playing the game a good bit i dont really find much in the way of sexual undertones
the only area it really stands out is in the gallery which is just silly and i am sure is so even for a prepubescent boy
as you play the game you are not worried about the endowments you just play the game
it does not detract from or add to the game it is just the way the characters are drawnthere are better games out there for the diehard fighting fans vf is the only one at this point i would say but for a beginner this is a great place to startif you have played the dc version then maybe you should stay away from this version but if not then you will be amazed
the graphics are really really inpressive with the cool and slick backgrounds very tight and easy controlsa very up beat sound track and most important if you have a ps multitap get ready for some of the most awesome tag team battles
over all this game is worth it and if you have not played alot of the dc version then its worth it even morethis is a really good fighting game
the load time is second to none
you can select random characters and random locations and the load time is really under  seconds
impressive graphics and fast paced game play make this game great
lots of replay value and  different modes make this a great game
the only bad point is the story mode  very short and wheres the storyprossuperb graphicsplenty of modesgreat extrasgreat gameplaygood voice actingbeautiful d arenasthe wemon cant git themtag mode is better than tekkens cuz u fight till the last man is outnice replay valueeasily one of the best fighting games avalibleconssoso musicwhen u hit with a powerful move sounds like a buildin fallin pretty unrealistic sound effectsstory mode pretty much makes no sencewish it had a end movie gallery like tekkenonly  characters
that aint all that muchits a port with more extras but all the cons could have been improvedwell i dunno bout story mode but everything else couldave been improved
still this is a game that should be own by all fighting fans with a psi enjoy a good fighter as much as the next person
but there are some fighters i thoroughly enjoy more than the next
i played streetfighter and mortal kombat and loved almost every minute of it
how do you enjoy getting beaten by the hard cheap characters or the bosses or your buddies
after mk went downhill and sf lost all its flair sf and its various editions were the best there werent any games out there that caught my eye
not bloody roar tekken soul calibur it almost did capcom vs marvel or capcom vs snk  i did enjoy streetfighter vs xmen but that is way old by now
buy you get the idea
i didnt enjoy fighters for quite some timedoa was a whole nother story
figuring i would try out one of these  cent fighters to see if they were as great as the magazines and everyone said they were
well i found that doa was simply an awesome game
it brought back the fun that i had when i first started playing streetfighter or mk and mkso what was it
the fighting was pretty swell with the fairly simplistic combos and so on
the characters looked great the best polygon characters i had ever seen
the backgrounds were great it was in japanese i played in the arcades originally and it was just so much fun
i realized that i would buy a ps just for this game
course when the ps came out well i let it slide for a few monthsi have to admit i did own the dreamcast version
i think the graphics are comparable
theres a little difference between graphics but im not sure what
the dc version seemed lighter while pss version seemes to be darker
and it doesnt have to do with the tint control of the tvwhile i believe this is the best fighter currently available well see about project justice or rival schools when that arrives
this is a must buy for all systems
i havent seen a doa for ps used and even the dc version there arent that many out therei think what would elevate this game into mass popularity like mk or sf is all the extra promotion involved
comic books or figures or anime  that will do wonders for this particular franchise
i love this game
maybe if there was a decent streetfighter available it could get doa a run for its money
doa may not have the depth in terms of story but the action will keep you addicted
if tecmo gets a story together and gives us a reason to like the characters more than visually ahem then  doa can stand above the rest of the fighters out therei was a wee lad with a new game gear and my only game was batman returns
sonic was all the rage being the only real competitor to mario and since i had a sega machine and no nintendo i opted for a sanic game for my portable devicei played this over and over as a kid seeing as i didnt get many titles for my game gear i didnt get many games period until i had a job and could buy them on my owni found all the secrets fought all the bosses and collected all the rings
while triple trouble will always be my favorite blue blur game chaos has its own charmi havent played the master system version but from what ive heard they are identical with the sms having more field of viewits a great spinoff from the main sonic titles on the consoles and youll enjoy either the gg or sms versions whichever your taste choosesits tough picking up ico in  after the game has been out for nine years and video game technology has come so far
some people would think im crazy for going all the way back to the beginning of the playstation  era just to play a puzzlesolving escort mission but after completing shadow of the colossus about a year and a half ago i was hooked
i wanted to know more about the world and experience more of the beauty of the shadow of the colossus universewhen my boyfriend gave me a copy of ico for my birthday earlier this year i was psyched
the only catch
shortly after i moved into an apartment and didnt own a television dang they are expensive
after a few months i finally saved up enough to buy a gorgeous new tv in crystal clear p hd and quickly jumped into the world of ico
sadly the graphics didnt look too hot due to the quality of the tv versus the age of the game that aside it was an absolutely fabulous game that hailed the reign of sonys ps and redefined what a video game could beico is the story of a young boy with horns who is left as a sacrifice by his people due to the horns of course inside a mysterious castle
inside the castle ico meets a mysterious princess named yorda who is also trapped there
ico must escape from the castle with yorda and protect her from the spirits who try to kidnap her and keep her in the castle
as you race through the castle you must solve puzzles and protect the girlbasically the entire game is an escort mission with puzzlesolving
doesnt sound like a great game on the surface but trust me its incredibly fun
yorda isnt too painful of an escort mission and the puzzles are fascinating
most importantly ico is a truly unique video game that stretches the stereotypes of what a game should beinterestingly enough ico is a very minimalist game
it doesnt have much plot much character development back story or even music for that matter but theres something about the simple beauty of this game that helps it transcend what a video game should be into art
its not about fighting or racing or anything just charming and simpleico may be difficult for gamers who have serious problems with escort missions and at times the game threatens to get a little boring due to the constant need to solve puzzles this is helped somewhat by the fact that its not a very long game
i also found that the puzzles seemed to hit a difficulty plateau relatively early in the game and didnt seem to get much more difficult from there on
perhaps my brain became more in tune with how the game was put together but i was surprised it didnt become more difficult just more uniquetruly ico is a great game a landmark of gaming and a great addition to a ps gamers libraryto be honest i am not sure how you would define what genre ico falls into
it has some rpg elements but is mainly a puzzlebased action game
but whatever it is and despite the lack of action i really enjoyed ico
heres whythe pros puzzles
while some people might consider puzzles to be the worst part of any  game i think they ae a major strength in ico
the castle your character is trapped in is huge with many winding staircases ladders traps and hidden areas
finding all these is the fun of ico
to move ahead you must solve a series of puzzles ranging is difficulty from very easy to very hardsolving all the puzzles is the most fun aspect of ico
freeroaming
i love the feeling that you can roam free in the castle
thought the areas are restrictive at first you have to roam arond and find your way out
the castle is huge and part of the fun is exploring all the areas
control
ico is a very easy game to control which means that you can concerntrate on what you are doing without having to worry about pressing the righ button
graphics
even people who hated this game acknowledged that the graphics are well above average
the character movement is nice and fluid and there is minimal popup or bleed through if any
the details in the castle are excellent from the shadows cast by the torches to the cobblestones on the castle floor
visually your in for a treatand now for the cons weak storyline
where ico differs from your atandard rpg besides being more actionbased is the minimal attention to story
you are a boy who is trapped in an ancient castle
a young princess is trapped with you
you must rescue her and escape the castle with your lives
that is the story
somewhat cliches by rpg standards
i deeper story would have helped
length
i found this game to be too short which might be a turnoff for the gamers lookingto get the greatest value for their dollar
i bought this game used as i do most video games so i dont really feel cheated
but i really wanted to keep goingwhen i beat this game
lack of challenging battles
being a puzzlebased game the battles and battle strategy are obviously on the back burner
i never got killed once
i think a more complex battle system would have added not only to the fun but the replay valueico is a curious little game
i enjoyed it though i found it at times short and uninvolving
i would recommend it to most people but not for diehard rpg fansyou can find the demo of this game in the latest summer playstation underground jampack
unlike what the editorial review states this game is still to this day displayed in a low resolution
granted the game isnt finished yet however sony would only have a month to change resolutions which may take more than a month to complete
still the gameplay is fun and definately different
might be worth checking out but im  gonna be careful after such sony bombs as legend of dragoon and dark cloudi picked this game up inresponse to the general hype and i wasnt let down
the game played well and was a delight for the total eight or nine hours it took to do a complete walkthrough and i even got lost at one pointthe graphics are beautiful and the characters move very realistically
the camera angles get a little weird at times annoying when youre in a hurry to rescue yorda from some creeps with your mighty stick but are overall well placed
the interaction between the character models was just fun to look at
i love how yorda stumbled when i was dragging her around like a madman and i love how they take stairs at their own gaits
or how they leave one foot on one step with the knee bent and the other leg one step below
thats the sort of attention to detail that im all about
there are a couple of instances where body parts somehow go through solid stone or chains and how the hell do you climb a chain while clutching a stick that size anyway
the random birds are very very nice and their reactions are pretty interestingid highly recommend the game to someone who just wants to get away from reality for a while just not a terribly long whilei love puzzle games
i am a huge fan of computer and console game that involve brainpower over button mashing
i had great hopes for ico on the playstation  and in general those hopes were fulfilled
with a few minor exceptionsfirst the graphics are lovely
the moody castle with textures and ghosty monsters really draws you in
youre a young boy with horns that is being sacrificed by your village quotfor the greater goodquot
lovely
you manage to escape though and you come across a waiflike young girl that seems pretty helpless
and this is where the story beginsyou quotdragquot the girl around really grabbing her hand and pulling her after you to get out of the castle
when monsters appear you defend her then tug her along again
shes pretty inept
she cant get many places that you can
so you leave her behind go around to find a way through for her then go back and bring her throughit does tug on your heart strings a bit when she jumps to join you and you reach out to catch her pulling her to safety
but you have to wonder  this boy is half her age
how come all she can do is stand there in the center of the room going quotjeez i dont know what i should do now
wont you come yank my arm out of my socket and show me where to go nowquotalso many of the puzzles are mighty contrived
most puzzle games these days have puzzles with some sense  something has broken and youre trying to put it back together say
but in ico the puzzles are old school
theres a box on the floor
when you push it stairs appear out of the floor
excuse me and this makes sense whyalso the game is really short
maybe  hours
compare that to something like final fantasy x where you literally play it for months and months and are having fun the entire timein general though this is a great game for kids to play ones that you want to keep away from grant theft auto  for a while
peaceful brainchallenging and a good helpothers messageit was only around the beginning of  that i finally decided to purchase this game used after hearing continual hype about what a great game it wasi wouldnt really say it was a disappointment
the graphics were incredibly beautiful and the castle where the game takes place is a fascinating and all around very interesting place to get lost in
an enjoyable game but it didnt really pull me in that much and i wouldnt say that its anywhere near one of the best games ive playedfor all of the beauty of the game it is unfortunately lacking in any kind of depth or interesting gameplay
well the puzzle solving was fun and interesting
but thats where the fun ends
there is absolutely no character development no variety whatsoever of different attack moves no real combos no magics or techniques no armor no accessories and a whopping  weapons in the entire game
the first half of the game you have a stick the second half you have a sword
thats it
also there is essentially only  kind of enemy in the entire game that you have to fight over and over and over and over again
the combat is just plain monotonous and boring and it really drags this game down
you have  move swing your stick or sword
it also has practically no replay value other than to maybe see the scenery one more timeso this game is very beautiful graphically its unique has a good story and is definitely worth playing through once if you like puzzle solving
but in my opinion its not all that underrated as it seriously lacks any kind of real depth to the gameplaybarely an above average gameive never enjoyed anything this vague before
ico is almost like playing an episode of the twilight zone
you arent provided with much backstory or explanation for any of the things that happen
this game does a great job of putting you in the heros part
its easy to identify with the main character who is an ordinary kid put in an extraordinary position
this isnt your typical unstoppable killing maching video game character
and thankfully you arent out to save the world againbasically the whole purpose of this game is to escape a castle which is basically one giant puzzle
you really cant say that the puzzles are seamlessly blended into the environmentbutno other game has come this close
i can also say that ive never played a game that gives off such a great sense of accomplishment once you solve a puzzle
it almost feels like you did some useful problem solving rather than collect the key or push the block
and it was great for the programmers to add tension in the form of enemies which attempt to abduct your companion once you leave her alone for a whileno other game ive played has this level of atmosphere
atmospheric is the best word to describe ico
the vistas are gorgeous even though the camera gets annoying once a fight starts
the cost is that the game has no replay value whatsoever
but with the rock bottom price you can find this game for its always worth iti just finished playing ico after about  or  hours of actual gameplay
i found it to be very interesting and pretty fun but far too short and with a few prominent flawsfirst of all this is the story about a young boy we assume his name is ico although i dont believe he is ever called this in the game
anyway this young boy happens to have been born with horns which from reading the booklet werent always as large as they are when you first see him
in his village those who are born with horns are said to bring famine and bad luck so on the day his horns grew large his th birthday he is taken by a few people on horseback brought to a strange temple and locked up in a little tomb to be sacrificed
they leave and due to a welltimed earthquake the boy escapes the tomb but finds himself in the middle of a temple which has fallen into ruins making the usual escape impossible to get tosoon you find a girl named yorda a pale spectrelike girl and free her from a hanging cage
from here on in you have to take her along with you everywhere by grabbing her hand or calling to her if you get separated
this would get annoying except that instead of protecting both you and her you really only have to watch out for her
ghosts will rise from the ground and try to pull her under but they cant harm you
you dont even have a life meter because the only way the game ends is if you fall from too high a place or yorda gets swallowed up by the ghoststhe story is not very well thought out
apparently yorda is a princess or something and the queen is trying to get her but cantmaybe
i dont even know and i beat the game
the point is that you wont really ever know whats going on so just accept what youre seeing and go with itthe art is lovely the sound effects are very good and there is no music most of the time which is both cool and creepy
the puzzles are the most important part of the game and they are pretty good but most of them are solved simply by exploring and paying careful attention
you get a stick as your only weapon at first but you get a sword after a while which helpsthe controls are very simplistic and the camera is a major pain in the rear end and for some reason on my tv the game was very very bright in the scenes where there is a lot of light making it hard to see details especially yorda because she is so pale and bright herselfall in all it was a good game
i suggest playing it in little bits or renting it there isnt much replay value in a puzzle game
and make sure that you stick around after the credits
you should do that with every game just to make sure
theres always little nuggets of joy to find after you read all the names enter a world of enchantment and wonder where once was is nevermore
ico a mysterious boy has been expelled from his village to an isolated castle
within his confines he begins to have eerie dreams of rescuing a young princess from the evil spirits that dwell within the fortress
blurring the lines between fantasy and reality ico embarks on a quest to save the princess and along the way discovers his own cryptic fatethe story is good not great
anyone looking for action look eleswhere because this game relies heavy on puzzle solving
there is a tid bit of action but nothing to fancy
this is a game for the puzzle crowd how to get to point a to b that whats this game is all about
its up to you ico to make passage ways for the princess who by the way lack that much agilty
you will only be cheating yourself and also be throwing away your money if you have a cheat guide its much more enjoyable if you accomplish something on your ownthe gameplay is solid for this type of game and never feels like you do the samething twice
the graphics are good and the atmospher and animation is something to be seenthe only complait i have is in the replay value and length
it last about  hours and once you complet it nothing changes so that is cut in half
other than that it is a good solid gameico is good and allbut i find it to be rather difficultsolving the puzzles is easy for meits just i find it toughto try and battle the spiritswhile trying to save the girl at the same timethe spirits always end up grabbing her and flying away with her before i have time to get back to her and pull her up out of the groundpluswhen you get knocked downit takes forever to get back upoverall thoughthis is still a very good gamethe story is fantasticthe graphics are pretty outdatedbut for their timethey are very goodive heard many people before comparing this to shadow of the colossusi think ico is alot better though
shadow of the colossus was very boring to mebut i highly recommend you check this game outi hope you have an easier time battling and defeating those dark spiritsthen i didthe mysterious game called ico never made a splash upon release nor did it really try to
just like its quiet and shadowy approach within the game its marketing was just as ambiguous
while i think this game was definitely underrated by audiences it was just a tad overrated by critics
you control a boy born with horns called ico whos been banished away to an immense castle as were told for the good of the village
there you escape and find a white glowing princess and you must lead her and yourself out of there while trying to avoid the princess being captured by her dark lordess mother and her ghouls while solving puzzles along the way to get outeyes and ears  on a simply artisitc level ico is brilliant and beautiful
its apparent with both graphics and sound the designers were trying to go for a more artsy approach rather than a straightout barnone eyepopping design
the graphics in this game are gorgeous but not to the casual observer as most of its inspired level design attention to detail and polished glitz are greatly overshadowed by a misty fog or a layer of light calming fuzz
this effect gives the mysterious world at some mysterious time a sense of surrealistic ambience almost as if we were dreaming this whole adventurous ordealsound i can summerize in one word quiet
the only music that ever plays during the game is when youre loading your game if you die and during the ending
the other  of the time there is no sound but various doves flying around footsteps clanks during battle the main characters mystery language and other sound effects
at first i felt the game couldve only benefited from some beautiful fantasy type music but later swallowed my words as doing so would make this dreamlike experience well far less dreamlikehands  while everything else in this game was beautiful i have to give an eh to the controls
see the camera is self moving which means you cant control it and you must move the analog stick in the appropriate direction depending on what angle the camera is pointing always annoying
also ive fallen more times than i needed to thanks to icos running being too loose to what degree im holding the analog stick
on top of that during battles its basically mashing the same button towards whatever enemy youre fighting but keep in mind battle is simply an icing on the cake in this game an easy icing the fundamental thing here is puzzle solving
decent controls but would have appreciated a tighter feelbrains  while many complain that the puzzle aspect in this game isnt anywhere near the challenge they thought it would be its for good reason this isnt myst
there are no collecting items for later strategic use or reading riddles and trying to figure out how to solve a puzzle from them or connecting jigsaw pieces together
the puzzle aspect in this game are from trying to find a way out of what specific area youre in and not only that but trying to get the princess a way out as well because shes not as nimble as you and cant do as much
getting from point a to b is the only point
also i think the concentration on this is only greater emphasized by the fact that there are no health meters no powerups no hidden treasures no timers
the only ways to die or lose is if the princess gets captured and pulled into the ghouls black hole or if you fall from a far distance
hint if you find yourself straying too far away from the princess youre not doing the puzzle right and she will be captured  always keep her as close as possiblehormones  while in the beginning most gamers may find this to be too slow the more patient and sensitive gamer will fall in love with this one
though you may think this game has no point play it long enough well not too long i beat it in  hours and the characters will grow on you leading to one of the sweetest and most hearttouching endings ive seen in a game in a very long whilesee the most beautiful thing about this game lies in its mystery
the fact that you dont know what time youre in or what world or universe youre in or who exactly these characters are where they came from and where they go afterwards
nor do you know what language theyre speaking in everythings subtitled
still you fall in love with this brave boy and beautiful princess because you become one with their adventure and you learn more about their character based on this rather than just having  pages of backstory written by the game designerthe purest ones who dont care for meglomania in games will see this one through and appreciate it greatly in the end
there most likely will be no sequal or prequal or spinoff
this is just a random but uniquely gorgeous little bird in a huge forest of birds wholl only be noticed and appreciated by a few
and just like a dream this one comes to an end short but the ride is great while it lastsif youre into castles heroism fantasy and lovable characters and need a break from blowing peoples heads off i did for a little bit pick this one up now
considering most people have it for less than  youve got nothing to losei really liked this game
i couldnt have appreciated it if i didnt play shadow of the colossus first
i may have given up on the puzzles too
i can see why this game didnt do well in sales
it isnt easy and is somewhat dull
i was intrigued by the gameplay for an older ps game
very creative and smart
i really enjoyed it
cant wait for the last guardian to come out
maybe in its a shame that such an original game could be released with no fanfare
this is a plain good game
it has many numerous flaws and isnt exciting at all but its original and the best puzzle game ever made
ico a little boy trapped in a castle finds a girl and tries to escape
in order to do it ico must solve puzzles to move room to room while fighting spirits trying to kidnap the girlill start with the negatives
its a slow tedious game
even when you know what to do to walk there is a chore especially dragging the girl around with you
the spirits cant even kill you but they take forever to be killed
there are also minor problems like some camera angles trouble doing simple things like lighting and throwing bombs and so forth and some parts of the game where you dont even no where to go to progress
sometimes a blessings sometimes a curse but there is very little music in the huge cavernous castle adding a feeling of loneliness and possible dullness to the gameto start off with the positives the most noticeable thing are the graphics
the best way to describe it is epic
you actually feel like youre in a castle despite the monotony of it all
the scenes where sunlight shines on the castle are spectacular
secondly its a great puzzle game
not too complex and pretty intuitive
sometimes youll be stuck but you can usually find a way or if youre just renting it you could just peek at a walkthroughprosgorgeousjust the right difficulty leveloriginalconstediousslow pacedtime  hours slight walkthrough helpdifficulty mediumfrustration mediumthis game has its own value to the gamers
eventhough i found its frustratingit still rocks
sometimes the girl is not cooperating with mesilly program thoughoverall this game meets my expectation and so do youi just played the demo and this game reminds me of myst
you are trapped in a beautiful world and you have to figure out where to gowhat to do
it tests your ingenuity and resourcefulness
the gameplay is really quite simple to learn the detailed d surroundings and fluid movements of the characters are captivating and the allvisuallytold story is engaging
the interaction between the ico and the princess or whoever she is is verysweet
a girl could appreciate this game but i dont see many younger kids gettting into it
it could be a bit boring to anyone who only wants to see blood and guts with techno music blaring in the background
since i have no attention span whatsoever i found the game boring after a while
but it is fun to watch other people play and try to collaborate on the puzzlesolving
my husband on the other hand thought it was the best game he ever played
he did admit however that he would like to see demons other than the same black smoky ones that try to kill the girl once in a while
if she dies its game over
the nice thing is that you can only move about and die in a manner very much resembling reality
although there is nothing scary about the graphics the suspense itself can give you chills at times
this game is definitely a gem among gems but i cant see its popularity  extending past a rather limited audience
of course i wouldnt mind being proven wrongico a work of art with little parallel
it is a prequelsequel to shadow of the colossus shadow coming out later but it could have happened centuries before this game
maybe
the game is just beautiful
it is early ps but it does not stop the asthetic of the game
the graphics are sharp clean and pretty
the puzzles are smart challenging and remarkable
the levels can be frustrating but you can figure them out
there is only one boss and she is sort of difficult if you dont know how to do itget this game if you have a ps
i know the ps version with shadow is coming out soon but if you dont have a ps then get this version
it is cool clean beautiful and has an ending so tender and soft that you might just cryi first saw this game on a nonplayable demo and at first glance i wasnt impressed at all
i usually prefer rich colorful graphics but this games graphics seem bland and washedout almost as if the contrast on my tv was turned all the way up
and the gameplay itself seemed even less appealing running through endless rooms of a castle while dragging some chick along by the hand
but after seeing one of the hosts of extended play give it a rave review i decided to try out a playable demo of ico
the sample i got left me craving moresuddenly the opaque animation took on a new life subtle hues revealing the eerie beauty of the mammoth castle
and outside instead of familiar blues and orange of sunsets for the sky the cliffside of the castle is shrouded in misty whites and grays
leaving you feeling both uneasy being in the castle yet wanting to see more of itnormally i would balk at yet another story were the quothelpless princess needs to be rescuedquot but for some reason this game seems different
perhaps because its more of a team effort with ico and the princess working together to find a way out of the castle i also think there is more to the quotpale princessquot than meets the eye
and i have to admit it was fun to have ico grab hold of her hand and take off through the castle but i think the animation might be a little too real there every time they started to run it felt like her arm was in danger of being yanked out of the socket and i wanted to keep slowing icos pace down so he wouldnt hurt her
yeah i know i know its just a game but its a testament to how well they made iti also liked that the controls on this game are very simplistic there was no frustration in trying to figure out which button controls what
ive read that the battles in this game are fairly easy and from what ive sampled id have to say so too
but that didnt detract from my enjoymentif the game is short i dont much care as long as what there is of it is satisfying and im fairly certain that it will be because this review was written based just on the demo i played im hoping to get the full version for xmas and i cannot wait to see how the rest of this game plays outi played a demo of this game and i think it is greatthis was the first rpg that i enjoyed the actionico is the only of its kindyou play as a boy who was born with hornshe is buried but escapeshe then finds princess yorda and they work together to get out of a castle haunted by moving shadowsif yorda diesyou losewith great puzzles and great action it is the best rpg everim sure this was a great release when it originally came out and it is still a quite fun play one or two times through yet it is obviously quite dated and may not live up to your expectations
this is best for the star wars purist and addict
any chance to shoot storm troopers is a chance well taken
most importantly though you cannot save
you will instead receive pass codes to return to levels once played
again a fun but old gamethis game is excellent 
the graphics are playstation   but who cares  its funi love blasting those  tie fighters and shooting the stormtroopers  its a great way to get rid of stress  especially after work do yourself a favor if you find this game  pick it upits a rare game  but its worth itespecially if your a hardcore star wars fan like myself   and the price is right  kudos namco museum  first in a series of five collections is one of the better selections in the series
pacman is probably the most well remembered and an excellent translation from the arcade version
galaga is another title that makes the transition well
but the best is bosconian
every level  every ship  even the bonus levels and the weird levels beyond the th are all there in glorious color faithfully rendered
the rest are a mixed lot including rallyx and pole position
a great ride for those who remember the classic arcade consolesthese games are great but the playability is not quite like the arcade standup models
for some reason there seems to be a slight hesitation when making some of the quick corners in ms pacman and dig dug
also pole position plays differently without the wheel
still the games are exactly as they were years ago
the sames tendencies i remember on galaga come alive in the playstation version
these are exact replicas of the originals that helped start it alli bought this as a christmas present for a friend of minehe is a pac man fan and since this game is featured in the disk i decided to buy it
he is ussing the ps to play this game and so far i havent heard any complains from him regarding the disksad to say this was my best friend for a couple of years
i loved alot of the cheesy and easy games that came with it but the fact at that time that you were able to play sonic the hedgehog on a small colored screen seemed unreal back in the day but this electronic item had so may ads and commercials that i thought to myself i needed to get one of these to see what everyone was talking about
games like afterburner spiderman and of course sonic the hedgehog were all availabel so after spending the odd  bucks on a state of the art hand held video game system i was able to play awesome video games anywhere
only with the acception that i was carrying over  brand new batteries besides with the new game boy sp out this is somethign definitely that can be named as the state of the art paperweightsega definitly had a good thing going when they were still marketing this system
not only did it have a backlit screen an 
year old system having a backlit screenare you listening nintendo
 it also had a slew of great games and a really cool design
i took mine to school a couple of weeks ago freakin finals
and people were actually willing to trade their gbas for a few precious minutes with my game gear
thats amazing
even though i only have  games now i actually had about  but i let somebody borrow most of them about  years ago and he never gave them back its still fun to playbut with every system theres always a few drawbacks
to start this thing is big
no its huge and it gets even bigger when you use a battery pack
next the sound isnt great its only decent and it doesnt get much better with headphones
lastly if you buy used games test them fully before you buy with sonic amp on mine i have to leave the cartridge sticking out about  or  mm or it wont even play at all
but overall ive had a lot of fun with my game gear over the last decade especially with the sonic titles and i plan to have even more fun until my system finally gives up
would i recommend it
in a word yes
if you can get around the fact that it is huge and that it is basically dead you and your game gear can and will have a long happy life together
i guarantee itthere is no comparison between the game gear and the gba july  reviewer a gamer from camarillo ca usai cant stand these people who are comparing the gba to the gg its no fair to the gg the gg came out in  and the gba came out in  thats no fair
i am what some call a sega fan so of course i choose the gg over the gba but the gba is cool too i reccomend getting both and the neo geo pocket color and the atari lynx of you have heard of those i found gg with ease who says they are hard to find i like them both but over all the gg is better and the gba is for nintendo people but lets pray when the psp comes out it will destroy the gba i know my review made no sense but lemmie say one last thing sega rulesyes it does rule but the psp will rule  times more go look at the psp forums for me mxerdont get me wrong ive always been a sega loyalist and always will be but the game gear never hit me like the gameboy did
first off the game gear takes more batteries than a gba not to mention it eats batteries like there is no tomorrow and the system itself is pretty big for a portable system
other than that there is really nothing wrong with the game gear other than the small game library
you get crisp colorful graphics and there are quite a few great games for it like any of the sonic games and there are quite a bit columns defenders of oasis virtua fighter animation jurassic park ecco tides of time the incredible hulk and mortal kombat   all in all the game gear isnt a bad system at all but its still outshined by the gameboy however at this cheap price having a game gear wouldnt hurtmy cousins had the nes and by the time they upgraded to the snes and n they gave it to me which was barely functioning by the time
my experiences with early videogaming were smacking my tv on the top smacking the nes and blowing hard in the cartridgesthen one christmas my uncle and aunt gave me a game gearthe first thing i saw when i opened it up was the image of batman on the batman returns cover
at first i thought it was a vhs copy of my favorite batman film and i was ecstatic
but the wrapping surrounded a much larger box so i continued to open it
finally as the wrapping lay ripped apart near my feet i held what was a copy of batman returns for the game gear taped to a purple and black box underneath
i removed the game and saw the main meat of my gift segas answer to the game boybut at the time i had no idea what it was
id heard of the game boy but never the game gear
so my reaction was a mixture of both excitement and confusion
like i said i didnt play video games much until then so i wasnt sure what i had in store for melittle did i know this would be my sole world of digital entertainment until i purchased my playstation with my own money mind you years lateri carried this thing everywhere
it wasnt long till i figured out that this thing is nearly useless if you use just batteries and my parents got sick of buying new ones the rechargeable technology we have today was nearly nonexistent back then
shortly thereafter i purchased an ac adapter and thats what i used all the time to power my portable machine
it never phased me after that that the game gear wasnt as portable anymore i just waited until i was home or at a relatives before busting out some sonic et althe colored backlit screen made me feel superior to game boy owners though i secretly lusted to play super mario land and eventually pokeacutemon every once in a while
but my time for that would come much laterback in the day the screen was amazing but ive noticed that after playing it recently after so many years of it being in the closet segas first handheld has a severe white wash to their colors
even playing with the contrast wheel will prove difficult to find that perfect angle
the game gear is notorious for having bad capacitors so theyll need to be replaced eventually
mine has been and the screen is back to new but theres just no going around that white washthe game gear is a great machine but if you havent played one back in the day and are used to todays backlitscreen technology you will be severely disappointed
emulating would probably be your best betthe volume on mine is unfortunately nonexistent even after replacing the capacitor but the headphones work just fineout of all the handhelds i own from the game gear and game boy color to the ds xl i find the game gear to be the most comfortable to hold without any grip attachments
its largealmost the size of a small tabletbut its very comfortable for adult hands
the buttons are very responsive though the dpad on mine has gotten sort of sticky on the bottom over the years
i may address that in the futurei burned many hours playing sonic triple trouble mmpr and the sequel and jurassic park
i own many other carts but those are my favorites
but would i recommend purchasing a game gearnothe game gear is amazing and i love mine and all the games i own but you wouldnt be missing out on much if you never got around to buying one with working capacitors
the games are dirt cheap but the only ones id recommend playing are sonic triple trouble and both mmpr fighting games
the former is the only exclusive sonic game on the game gear and the power rangers games are some of my favorite portable fighting gamesthis was my first pg video game but about my eigth that i have been searching for to quell my desire to be a general and use my brains to do something similar to what they did in ww
pg does that
i find it fairly accurate and a lot of fun
what could have been done to make it more challenging fun and realistic would be to take into account supply and logistics
guderion nor karhkov could just click a mouse and wait a turn to be completely refitted
maybe the next pg pg they will
docvthe new pg adds very little to the previous version other than changing the interface
at the same time i have always enjoyed pg so i value this new edition mostly for the new scenarios and campaigns
for me a campaign pack would have done the same job
as a gamer who sticks to the same old games over the years i was glad to see this one
for someone familiar with the previous version and looking for variety this will be a disappointmentfor someone new to pg this will be as good a start as any of the other versions
the game generally takes a while to figure out and can be quite frustrating at first as your army tends to get beaten up all the time
as you gain experience with the game you will find it more and more enjoyable not just as tactical combat but i think you can also appreciate the oveeral campaign strategy of building an army of experienced and complimentary unitsamong the few new things the most important is probably removing the prestige as the quotcurrencyquot  of the game and making acquisition of new units conditional on their availability
as a result you no longer end up with a clearly overpowering force in the later stages of the campaigns as usually happened with pg iithe other important change is that units do not get experience through battles but instead rely on promotions for the commander assigned
this really put an end to the common strategy of having units fight tough battles in the beginning just to upgrade their experienceoverall the game is like a picture from an old vacation   you like to look at it for the memory but it doesnt generate any new excitementi like this game because it fixed the big problems of its predecessor pgd assault
firstly it only costs  slot for any unit regardless of experience level
this means i no longer have to put up with ridiculous  to  or even  to  oddssecondly the crashes when i ambush the computer are gonethe units also are better animated than before
now you see things like tanks traversing their turrets towards their targets to firehowever this game creates new headaches
i dont like the numerous exitthismanyunitsoffthemapbyturns or you lose scenarios
they are unrealistic
i dont know of any real ww battle where something like this had to be done
the time table for these operations are also way too shortthis game is also stingier than pgd assault in giving out promotions and extra roster slotsthis game is definitely superior to pgd assaultalso i wish it had more hypothetical usallies vs communists battlesthis anime action game is quite fun
i never played these types of games before but i like this one
you are konoko a female combat expert
you need to know how to use guns as well as martial art skills
you are put into dangerous situations and must complete all of your mission objectives to move on
along the way you will find out more about your mysterious pastfrom a christian perspective i am impressed
the main character being a female is decently dressed
the is no foul language you can taunt your enemies if you like its all clean
there is violence guns and marital arts but technically there is no blood
one interesting note the word oni has many meanings in the japanese language
some of the meanings include ghost ogre or demon
in the game it is hinted that the main character konoko is not completely human
i do not know what she is i dont want to spoil the story
all that you do know is that she has an unknown past unknown future and is living in a dark timethe game is easy to install
the upbeat music adds to the game
there is no multiplayer in this game
one thing i found odd is saving
you cant save whenever you want there are save points that save for you
as for controls the default is using the wasd keys
the only way to change that is to modify the keyconfigtxt file
this game got me converted to using the wasd configurationthis game is detailed in the fighting department even though it is a fightershooter hybrid
the number of offensivedefensive moves that you can do with a keyboard in incrediblebut there is the catch the keyboard
i cant find a way to use my wingman game pad controlleryou move forwardbackward and strafe leftright and perform jumppunchkick with your keyboard you turnchange your line of sightaim with the mouse
and there is no autoaiming  it is a good thing that your guns comes with a aiming sight laserlike to let you know where you are aiming but  frankly i was more expecting an allonagame pad control scheme especially if this game is also done on playstationyou cant even change what keys on the keyboards you may use
everything is frozen
 well thats not entirely true
you may change the settings by editing a file called quotkeyconfigtxtquot
but i am all confused as to why they the designer never installed a control configuration option screenthe savingscheme is quotsubepisodequot based
your game is saved once you have reached a certain point in the game
you cant save anywhere and there are no savepoints
and the saves are pretty far apart
ltgrumblegt i still ache from repeating a segment of the game over and over and over and overaside from this the game is still
very good thus the  stars out of 
the fighting is extremely hectic but rewarding once you master the control scheme
rejoice on taking down plenty of enemiesthe graphics are very good without being overly detailed
this lack of detail is good for a few reasons a this is a animeenvironment game anime is a term used for japanese animation style b with so much action any more details would slow down the game on any computer
the faces on the characters are static when they talk but i personally dont put much emphasis on that for this type of game
the music is great i even got the oni soundtrack
and the voiceovers are well overacted
but hey
this is anime
its supposed to be like thatthis is a very satisfying game that does it with plenty of action and style
but the two keywords of warning should be hard control scheme bad save feature
as always i recommend you download the demo from the designers website  to try out the controls
if you can handle it go for it and buy the gamenote  although i use the term quotanimequot quite often all designers of this game are americanbased
this is not a game ported from japan
it is heavily inspired by animehyped beyond the stars oni left many reviewers cold upon release
but this animestyle rdperson fighter should not be passed up for a number of strong reasonsone of the many criticisms centers around the bland level design and the less than stellar graphics
however the core of the game namely the fighting system  is wonderful in its threedimensional complexity and its aesthetic resultskonoko the cartoon version of run lola runs female lead can not only fight like neo but she has the same liking for guns which she can borrow from her opponents
the enemies themselves are wellrealized though a bit repetitive though this is fairly commonin a way this is a great opportunity to play an infinitely cooler version of tomb raider
only now the characters moves an other aspects of the game are somewhat better craftedarguably animeinspired games have an edge over their classicallythemed competitors due the inherent appeal of violent cartoons
oni is no different and its a wonder it didnt end up somewhat more highly regarded
though cutscenes arent particularly well made at least the voice talent is indeed talentedas long as the criticisms are addressed then onis sequel if anyone takes up the franchise could become a hitin the classic tradition of the james bond films quotno one lives foreverquot certainly had an excellent chance to be a groundbreaking game
unfortunately while the potential is there the game comes off as simply a slightly better than average fps
dont get me wrong i enjoyed most of the game but the downsides really took away from what would have otherwise been an excellent gaming experience
the positives i found were the wonderfully designed levels the interaction and personalities of each character the cinematic cutscnes the length of the game it took me a week to get through it the voice actors the humor and the diversity of locales
obviously there are many more positives that i wont go into here
as i said before however there are a few downsides to the game
it was obviously made by feminists as nearly every cutscene involves one of archers male allies or enemies rapping on her because shes a woman
it wouldnt be so bad if they put such rhetoric in once or twice but it occurs countless times throughout the game
this added nothing and took away a good deal
also there is a good deal of cursing and some sexual related dialogue
the violence can also get pretty intense sometimes for a quotteenquot rated gameoverall its a game worth checking out in the current market although there have been many fps better before than this onei was pleasantly surprised by this game
its far from the run of the mill firstperson shooters that are being churned outwhats different
first of all theres actually a story and plenty of cutscenes between and during the missions
the locations are in the exotic locales you would expect in a s spy flick
the music is excellent youll find yourself humming the theme song the acting is top notch i love cates accent and as many of the other reviewers have pointed out the characters have plenty of interesting stories you can eavesdrop onthe ai is some of the best ive seen  the bad guys hide duck behind corners or nearby objects and generally make it seem like they would prefer not to be shot
the developers have spent a lot of time making each locale look authentic plus they have a great sense of humor too
among other gags youll see a large sign pointing a rocket ship to the left with an equally large sign pointing out the toilet to the righti only have a couple problems with the game
first off its not really a quotshooterquot
its more a quotsneakerquot resembling thief or rainbow six
perhaps im just not that good at this game but there are missions that i just find impossible to complete
im always getting caught which sets off all the alarms and causes a quick death for me
ill probably have to get a walkthrough or cheat codes to finish the game and i hate games where i have to do that
maybe im getting oldthe load times are excruciating
load up the game start a mission go make a sandwich eat it take a nap wake up get married have kids eliminate world hunger and hopefully by that time the mission will have started
finally i can see people with highend systems complaining about the graphics
personally i dont think its a big deal its kind of like comparing the graphics quality of unreal tournament verses quake   who cares as long as theyre fun to play  but i want to mention it as they do look a little dated and thats a big deal for some people
by the way the framerates are smooth on my machine which only meets the minimum listed system requirementsso if youre a fan of the s secret agent movies or you just want to play a shooter that requires brainpower then i would recommend this game to you
i hoped my review helpedid purchased this game several months ago and it only saw about  minutes of playing time
ive been burned out on just about all games for quite a while now
i decided to give nlf another chance and im glad i did
this is the first game ive finished in about two years
none of the others recently have been able to hold my attention
nlf did in spadesthe levels are desinged very well and none of them too complicated or too large
its nice to be able to play for only  minutes and still make some head way
granted if you have the time to do marathon sessions nlf can definately keep you occupied
you dont have to lose contact with all your friends and family while you try to finish it though  unless of course you want to the graphics are very good and ive played on a few different systems
granted a celeron  w a tnt cant swing  x  and wont play any game at the resolution at an acceptable rate but even on a   x  and even  x  were playable
the game looks awesome at the higher resolutions if you have the hardware to run iti dont often comment on music in a game but in this case i will
id compare it to ssx for the playstaion  besides sounding very very good the music is dynamic
when you round a corner and get into a shootout with some gaurds the music reflects this
the tempo becomes a bit faster and the horns sound more on edge
the music adds a lot to the gameover all this is a very good game
i was reminded a lot of halflife
there wasnt anything in the game that was stolen from halflife
i was reminded of halflife due to the very solid game play
id call this halflife with more personality and not so hard puzzles
had this game come out  years ago this would be a quotbreak through  star you life will never be the same unless you own it gamequot considering whats out ther today id call it a very solid game that has a lot of character and feels refreshing even though there isnt anything really new
of all the games out there right now i cant think of a better game than nlf to spend an evening playingi have to confess i stopped playing firstperson shooters a while back
i got bored with repetitive action kill all the baddies on a level find the secret stuff move to next level ad nauseum
but i bought nolf when my wife gave me a gift certificate to the local software store
i wasnt sure what to get but had read some really good things about nolf a while back and thought i would give the genre one last tryim really glad i did because this has been a terrific game
its highly addictive and already my wife regrets her choice of birthday gifts
but i am amazed at how far the game has advanced the genre
intelligent enemies compelling characters and a great array of weapons and gadgetry are just a few of the highlights
i dont have hours to kill on games every day but this game makes me wish i did
but my point is i dont consider myself a hardcore gamer but i found the game very easy to learn and yet very deep and immersivethe only reason i didnt give it  stars was because the engine could be improved although as other reviewers have noted you really dont notice because the design and gameplay are so good and to leave some wiggle room for discovery of any annoyances and problems laterall said this is a huge thumbsup and i encourage anyone who wants a good story and great challenge to consider no one lives foreverits no secret that i am not a fan of action gaming
action games bore me unless they are multi player games unreal tournament or tribes
however this game is different
its typical in its action gaming but untypically it has an excellent story line
the cutscenes in this game if all put together could make a rather hilarious movie
the online gaming element isnt bad at all either
the vehicle riding is quite fun and though its not tribes its certainly not boring either
i did find myself getting bored of the action in the middle but thats just me
i wanted to complete this game to check out every cutscene
see the sexy archer working her way through a mans world
haha if i did not know better id say this game was made by feminists
the only low i can think of for this game is that the game is so wacky it takes away from the coolness of the action
mixing comedy and hardcore action is not easy but this game does its bestthe game itself is pretty much a doomduke nukem clone in terms of play style and quotattitudequot right down to the smart quips that sam occasionally offers which means that it has all the strengths and weaknesses inherant in that style of fps
but its a dd thats been updated with the best graphics engine that ive ever seen on a game period
indeed if you go to croteams page youll see that theyre pitching the engine as hard as theyre pitching the game and i dont blame themreally this is one beautiful game
the levels are physically huge as in you can literally see for miles of real terrain the colors are crisp the lighting effects are beyond unbelievable and the physics engine is so impressive that it has to be seen to be believedof course such graphical power comes as a price
i have a voodoo and a p   i can play the game on this system after downloading the wickedgl driver but i need to play it on the quotspeedquot settings which basically turn down the graphics to their minimum settings
it still looks good but i compared it against a friends machine which is a gh p with a maxed out gforce card
the difference is like the difference between a hannabarbara cartoon and a disney epic
aspects of the game were practically photorealistic
it looked even better with his d glassesif youre running anything slower and less capable than my system see above i really wouldnt recommend buying this game youll just frustrate yourself
if you have a system thats adequate such as mine i think its worth it
if you have a graphics powerhouse then buy this game if for no other reason than to show off the capabilities of your system because theres no other game on the market that will do as good of a jobthis would have been a good game for  but since the list price is  then this is a must have for anyone that remotely likes fps
and if you liked doom then you will absolutely love this gamejust make sure you have a decent computer p  with a good video card voodoo  or higher and youll be all setthis game would have gotten  stars easily but the multiplayer kinda sucks
i mean the multiplayer aspect is fun but the network codes really sucks
i get kinda laggy on my cable modem and could barely even play it on my girlfriends  modembut dont let the lackluster multiplayer stop you for  bucks youll have a blast in single player mode and if your feeling alittle adventurous then you can build your own levels with the included softwareyouve read the other reviews i imagine
but one thing they may not mentioned is this  its  bucks
 it has one of the most enjoyable multiplayer elements of any game around
basically a coop multiplayer mode that allows you to go through the entire game with  other people
this is a real blast i tell you
if you have a decent internet connection read  cable or dsl couple of friends and the yearning to be up all night this is the game for youthis game is from  so its nothing spectacular in terms of graphics or the game engine
but it is still fun to playpros no monster graphics or hardware required these days
plenty of killing action
easy to usecons some of the secrets can be a pain to get to
repetitive scenery and monsters
the usual linear paths of any fpsit may be  but the graphics are actually pretty good  better in fact than the sometimes blocky graphics of the originalhalflife
and this is from a brandnew back then game engine
it just goes to show you what an independent in this case croatian company can do sometimes they can do better than the big companiesit starts out slow in terms of monsters the usual alien beasties but it ramps up  each successive level contains more and more monsters until you have them coming at you in huge waves and i do mean waves
the weapons are the usual  knife pistol chaingun rocket launcher shotgun etc nothing special there though the sbc cannon is fun imagine a cannon just like youd find on a pirate ship loaded with uranium ammo
some of the secret areas are obvious others arent  and while you dont need to do the secret areas in order to complete a level they usually contain ammo and health or even a weapon which you might not get to until later in the game and some of them will take you to secret levelseach enemy killed gets you points but thats only for your own personal high score
you can also race against the clock if you wish but as usual when an fps game does that about only way to beat their time is to cheat
oddly enough theres no flashlight in this game and one would come in handy in a few spots  but its absence is survivableall in all its a fun and easy game to go through good for killing a few hours and lots of enemies
there are no real secret storylines to this just the usual save the earth stuff
a good bit of replay ability which is always nicea good game to get for some mindless killing fun
also recommended isserious sam  the second encounter which continues the story and the funthere is also an hd version available of this game and the followup but its not worth it  yeah the graphics are slightly enhanced but that doesnt affect gameplay
and from what i understand the hd versions include steam drm which should be avoidedat a time when most firstperson shooters turn towards greater realism in the gameplay serious sam does pretty much the exact opposite thing giving the player fastpaced action as you take on the dukenukemlike character of serious sam and launch yourself against hordes and hordes and hordes of monsters
the graphics are lush
the settings are unique
the gameplay is nothing but funthe seller was books r fun
i paid about  bucks
it works fine on my pc running windows xp home sp
the latest patch for the game is version this is a runandgun first person shooter
there is a story to it
there is humor scattered throughout and that added to the entertainment valuethe graphics and sound are fine for its day
the controls worked well and they are configurable
there is an assortment of various guns
its stable ie few or no crashesits fun for what it is a mindless runandgun with some entertaining dialogi also triedserious sam the second encounter but didnt like it because it was too much like the first game
one of these games is enough for mevisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionswhat got me was the sheer amount of bad guys that appear on the screen at one time hundreds
it looks good plays well and the price is simply great
this is the game daikatana should have beenthis is my favorite action shooting game
i like the graphics detail and gameplay
the weapons and ammo are awesome
thanksthe title is ironic because theres not much serious about this game
its a cheap thrill like well suffice it to say that serious sam is one of those quick and dirty pleasures in lifein the spirit of doom ss throws dozens of monsters at you at once
you use an impressive arsenal of weapons and a plethora of ammo to blast them into little bits
the levels are welltextured but in the end are merely excuses to get you to the next room full o baddiesmultiplayer has some bugs but im sure theyll be fixed in upcoming patches
for price this is worth it for almost any fps fanthis is a firstperson shooter that plays like the old tilebased shootemups
especially in cooperative mode there are monsters coming at you from every angle all the time and its just an actionpacked blastits beautiful too
the engine and levels are just amazing to beholdsome of the arenas can get a bit repetitious but frankly you need the practice for later in the game so i excuse them
serious sam is just a great gamewell okay the monsters could use a bit of help
some of them are silly
however a few of the stronger monsters are awesome
some of them are so huge
oh my gosh they could like step on cyber demons
for those who played doom   this game is just good fun not so serious but fun
one player mode is what i like best i havent had good multiplayer experiences but i think its because of my slow modem
my recomendation is this if you want a game that is just amusing and fun get this
 its a little frustrating at points when monsters just teleport out of nowhere behind you and hit you really quick but i suppose its part of the gameserious sam is an fps with a great action gameplay
you play sam quotseriousquot stone a charecter like duke nukem or caleb of blood who is sent back in time to save the world the whole game takes place in ancient egypt with about  levels
i played it on the default opengl video mode the graphics are fantastic as good as quake
the textures look real
the levels are very big and the areas are very large with many wideopen spaces
i like the choice of weapons too
the saving and loading times are also good
it is not a game like halflife the gameplay is just get from point a to point b by shooting everything that moves no puzzles solving and not many jumping too
there are not many different monstors but there will be loads of them comming on all sides they respawn a lot but they dont cause much damage and it is not very hard getting them
picking up ammo and health respawns the monstors infact if you find a locked door pick up the ammo and health packs lying arround the monstors will come on all sides and when you killed them all the door will openthe game is quite short but it has a great replay value and this game is not about completing it is about enjoying the action gameplay
the multiplayer cooperative and split screen modes and the very cheap price make serious sam really worth it
serious sam is one of the best action games i have ever played and it is a must have if you like action gamesi admit i was skeptical at first about serious sam but it was a fun game
the graphics are superb and the game is pretty fast paced
it even has a decent plot
but the reason i gave it  stars instead of the full  was that i found the game lacking in its challenges
i mean when you have to find something in this game like a key or an object to trigger a door its usually in plain sight and easy as pie to find
i was impressed with the sheer volume of enemies i had to face though they were all dumb as bricks
in one spot you face around  enemies at one time
i had to use the godmode otherwise this game is near impossible to finish because of the sheer number of enemies coming at you
over all it was worth the  i spent on it but i wouldnt pay full price for it
but i enjoyed it for what it was
a pure shootem up to win game
basically doom with better graphicsserious sam the only man who can save the earth makes his first appearance
serious sam is a nice change from all the flashy difficult shooters because there is very little puzzle work involved
simply pick up your guns and start shooting anything that moves
its quite simply a newborn doomsome of the remarks sam makes are very funny and the enemies come in all different sizes from small zombies to giant insectshowever sometimes the game gets difficult and it has you tearing your hear out
so many enemies coming at you and no cover at all means you have to be quick on your toes and quick on the trigger
plus it gets repetitive as well
simply going in killing everything and going out gets boring after a whileplus the enemies all have the same attacks
and they just run blindly at you with no regard for anything else which doesnt make a challengehowever if you can turn a blind eye to these flaws then serious sam is a classic shooting game which has everything a trigger happy guy would likegood bitsfast actionlots of bad guyslots of gunsplenty of funny bitsa nice changebad bitsrepetitivesometimes difficultpoor aithe verdict  out of alternitives if you like this then try duke nukemenjoyif youre looking for a complicated rich storyline this game is not itif youre looking for a first person shooter where monsters come in countless waves and all you gotta do is hold the trigger down this game is for youserious sam has been rated by many as a mindless shooter and thats exactly what it is
great funmultiplayer cooperative matches are simply a blasti found serious sam on the bargain rack at a wellknown electronics score for significantly less than retail
as i was on my way to a lan party i figured it would be a great game for the downtimes when people werent all playing the same thingi was right
serious is a first person shooter fps cast in the doom mold
youre a superwarrior sent back in time to eradicate the forces of evil blah blah blah the plot is utterly unimportant
this games major strengths are its sense of humor and its sheer silly level of monsterkilling action
i play on the normal setting and i feel like i get a workout as i try to kill dozens of monsters at a time
the game constantly bombards you with a flow of welldesigned enemies and your weapons which seem ridiculously overpowered when you first pick them up are barely enough to keep you alive from one courtyard to the nextserious sam has seriously large outdoor environments
theres a lot of distance running in the game which while sometimes tedious serves to impart a sense of realism
the monsters and environments are all mostly brightly colored providing a change from some newer games tendencies to paint in shades of graythis game is a runandgun shooter with almost no brain and its fun that way
you kill the monsters move on to the next environment and kill a ton more monsters dont forget that quicksave key
sam has some great oneliner comments in the tradition of duke nukem d that add laughoutloud moments every now and againthis game doesnt try to do too much and knows exactly what it is and what to stick to
its not a genreredefining piece like halflife or a technical masterpiece like max payne but its great fun and if you liked doom or doom at all you owe it to yourself to play serious samserious sam is based around two different aspects fun and intense gameplay
this is a game that will be liked by any lover of first person shoot em ups
you travel ovr loads of different area ranging from egypt to several distant planets
the main aim of the game is to stop mental an assasin but i just spent most of my time going around shooting people because its funthis is obviously a mod for halflife
but its a really good one and i have no problem paying for it
the wierd flexible weapons they add are really nice
level design though linear is nice
the dinosaur models turned out really nice although they only appear at the very begining  wish they had been in there more
driving the tank was pretty cool too
and i even liked the plotstill it hit some of my pet peeves
i despise annoyance monsters the ones with only one hit point that serve only to waste ammo
i dont mind that the game was pretty short not hitman short but still pretty shortreally cool and it looks little  better than half life lots of maps cool story and you get to ride in a tank
it could be a little better but i think the makers of this game did a good job plus you dont need to have or even know about half life to play this unlike the other addons you need half life to play them so this is good for anyone who didnt like or get into hafe life btw half life rocks if you havnt played it i think you should i can sum this up quite simply if you loved halflife youll really enjoy gunman
its story is not entirely original the graphics are dated by the halflife engine upon which the game is built but all the fun and action of the game youve come to love is there
buy this game to extend your halflife high not to be blown away by the next generation of first person shootersat first it could be easy to overlook this product as it is a totalconversion of the classic half life that was created by a group of new programers the world over
many of the team had not even met one another as they worked on the project
that being said they game is fantastic the work that resulted is a fantastic d action shooter with an enjoyable storyline
the player is cast in the role of archer the new leader of the gunman
the gunman battle enemies in the galaxy keeping it safe for colonization
the general of the gunman was lost in a mission years ago and in the time sense deadly alien xenomes have been raiding the colonies and killing all they find
before long archer is deep in the mix and being assaulted of all manner of creatures in a all out war for survival and to end the xenome menace
the game is a solid program and has a very gripping and involving story
i especially enjoyed the level where the player gets to use a tank and the enemies are very well designed and amongst the best ever created for a d shooter
the weapons in the game all have multiple settings for different abilities and this can make for some great strategy when playing online
here is hoping for another chapter in this series in the near futureover two years have passed since the original gangsters
while the original clearly had carved out a new niche genre it was mired in complexity and micromanagement
not so with gangsters hot house and eidos listened to the gamers feedback and implemented many features to make gangsters  much more accessible to players
the first thing you will notice is a much more intuitive interface
while i am still a little hesitant to give the interface a glowing review its a bit tricky to read some windows and decipher information at the building level it is much more simpler than the original
and with the lack of micromanagement of each individual gangster like the original you control the main character joey bane and his lieutenants
all other hired muscle is controlled by you immediate family or built in ai scripts which are pretty goodupon loading the game you will notice that gangsters  revolves around the story of joey bane you
it seems your father a big time mobster was killed by the opposing family moving into the city
it is your job over individual episodes to move back into your home town avenge your fathers death and assume the role of mob leader
you start small just taking over a neighborhood but as he story progresses and you move on to episodes you eventually take over the city then neighboring cities then eventually cross state lines setting up your empirecut scenes between each episode move the story along in a concise fashion and a preepisode briefing is really good in defining your primary and secondary objectives
there is good feedback could always be better during the game from a family advisor and reading the local newspaper
the newspaper all allows you to hire specialists that can carry on special assignments for you lists obituaries and clues you into other subtle hints and game progressthe graphics are pretty good but not top notch
a new addition to the game is being able to play at night where street lamps light the streets and shading effects are more visible
also there are seasons so later in the game youll notice the snow fallinggame control is better than the original but is still tricky
good thing there is a pause button the game is real time to reissue orders
i found i made a few errors in assigning tasks to my gangsters only because selecting them is very sensitive
game ai
is also good but could be better
when in trouble i have selected my gangsters to flee only for them to sit around idle for a few seconds and get shot at before they run
and they seem to sometime run the wrong way
also navigating your cars can be a bit frustrating
seems that sometimes that computer chooses the longest path to get somewhere via car when your car could easily take a turn down another street and get to a destination in half the timethe manual is nice explains pretty thoroughly what you can and can not do and even walks you through the st two episodes
the only complaint about the manual is a few screenshots used for explanation are blurrygangsters  offers multiplayer support
now thats awesome
you can have up to  godfathers trying to compete over a city
however it would have been much better if there was a random map generator for not only multi but single players as well
after you complete the game in  episodes you just restart it again at a higher difficulty level but its the same cities and same objectivesas you move on from episode to episode you take your hired hands with you and dole out experience points to them in different categories based on performance combat stealth or special skill diplomat distiller bomber hit man driver etcwhen you take over buildings in the city either by buying them by force etc you must stay in control
for the building generate you money and if you set up an illegal business speakeasy card den brothels brewery distiller gun smith etc you rake in more money to expand your empire
use money to buy better guns recruit muscle buy better armored cars and buy influence over the police the judge the da etcbribery is big however the fbi are incorruptible but every other figure in the game is
i love the drive by shootings
i often eliminate my opponent by taking out enemy gangs by tommy and shotguns via a drive by hop out of the car and bust up their business either by bombing or killing those inside massacre style and speed off before the police arrive
this disrupts the cash flow for your opponent and even better if you can capture the business yourself and set up shop
you generate more money while increasing your influence in town
but be careful you better hire guards for you new place because your opponent doesnt like you taking over and will soon dispatch his own thugs to reclaim lost businessesone of your gang members in jail
no problem
maybe you just need to put the judge or the da on your payroll
or maybe a breakout is more your styleim just touching the base of things you can do
there are many illegal business to set up cars to steal people to kidnap patrol your area buy of the mayor etcall in all a very worthy sequel and worth the moneygangsters  lives up to most of what it promises
the setting is realistic some strategy is involved and upgradable gangsters but it does have a few weaknesses
while imo it is better then the original in terms of graphic sounds and ease of play the openendness of the game has been cut back
set over a series of assignments you travel across the quotstatequot carrying out various missions in each city
while the missions barely vary there are easy ways and hard ways for pretty much each one there is a nice roleplaying touch that allows you to carry over gangsters and improve their stats
however this is about as close to roleplaying a gangster boss youll get to and the same is true for the empire building aspect
unfortunately while you can carry over gangsters and specialists you dont carry over equipment or money which is odd considering your empires growth
the missions get harder by tactical positioning of enemies and resources yes there is a gathering aspect and unfortunately the ai never really improves which means tricks from earlier scenarios work in later ones
all and all the game is superior to the first but limited in its ability to really let you quotbe a gangsterquot and explore the seemy underworldgangsters  is a fairly good game with good controls and eidos payed good attention to the details of the hits bombings and drivebys you carry out
the only real problem that i see in it is that even on the easy setting the game is hard
the gangsters you fight keep getting harder and you seem to keep getting less and less money as the missions go on
you think that the fact that you get more cars start with some muscle for bane and are allowed to bring more gangsters would even out but in the end the only thing that matters is the cold hard cash
without it you dont stand a chance at winning and its hard to get any cash when every illegal business you setup the enemy is on in a second killing the specialist
those are the only overall flaws with the gamedid you like the old lee marvin flick the dirty dozen
how would you like to be in the dirty dozen
sweating it out hiding in a dark corner of a shipyard trying to figure out how to distract the nazi guard long enough to get on board a ship  maybe if you left a pack of cigarettes at the other end of the alley hed leave his post long enough for you to get in
maybe next youll have to throw a knife into a japanese soldiers back before he hits the alarm
use a sniper rifle to pick off guards so you can reach your target
blow up bridges steal intelligence commandocrawl across telephone wires and sneak up on unsuspecting soldiers dressed as the enemy to accomplish your goalswere talking about gutwrenching dear lord i hope they dont catch us tension your mind working like a rat in a maze trying to accomplish the goals set out in about a dozen mission scenarios each completely openended
kill or incapacitate
be sneaky or make some noise
its all up to you but everyones got to come back alive
youve got a number of characters including a sniper a dog 
 a thief with a pet rat a femme fatale and others
the equipment
tripwires beartraps sleeping pills the usual assortment of arms and more
the squadbased tactics in the commandos series is only improved by this latest iteration and are like nothing else anywhere in computer gamesi knock a star off for a bit of instability in the game  some crashes but if youre smart you save often anyway
if you like wwii andor tactical strategy games ala rainbow six this is truly your cup of teai have been playing this game for the past several weeks to release some stress and keep my mind movingthe game playing is realtime and realistic
if you make a mistake or forget something the game will pick it up and send solders your way
it is very important to think of all the details of your attackthe graphics on the game are detailed
the graphics on the commandos enemy solders tanks and landscape are ones to take examplethe characters all have their own specialty which adds even more complexity to the game
meaning the sniper character cannot handle mines and viceversathere are  missions and each have a bonus mission so that you can practice more on your characters and get more strips and medals
the missions get harder and cannot be played without the experience and understanding of the previous missions
each mission utilizes some or all of the  charactersi gave this game  stars because i found that sometimes when you found a method to handling the enemy the game was trivial and very much time consuming
although compared to other military strategy games this comes at the top of my listhave fun mastermining against the germansthis is probably the hardest game that i have played on the computer
i love this game because it keeps you on the edge of your seat in thinking that you are actually a real life member of the swat team
i had difficulties with nearly every level
each level killed me at least  times before i would finally get the hang of it
this is a must buy for anyone out there who is into scary stuff
this game chilled my spine with the omnimous music
this game is even better with subs installed in your sound systemcan you get a better deal than a dualjewel game
you get two games which are probably very good or they wouldnt have been around for this long real cheap
if you have not yet played the fallout series then get out there and get your hands on them quick before you can no longer buy them at allfallout i is a futuristic hackandslash roleplaying game
it has a great turnbased combat system based upon action points
i enjoyed the combat in this game thoroughly
it is a nice reprieve from the endless frustration that you get from lots of the other games out there
i have had enough of realtime combat rpgsthis is not to say that fallout it easy
fallout is still a very challenging game
you have a few huge quests instead of a lot of small ones
the entire map is open to you very early on and there is little direction to direct you to what to explore first
this makes the game very hard at first since you cant survive half of the areas at low levelsthe game has a lot of nice features
most dialog only has text but the major characters have animated conversations that are nicely voiceacted
the richly animated faces of these characters is a nice surprise
the aging graphics and sound of this game will not affect your enjoyment of it at all
there are a lot of weapons to choose from and the gore effects are a real treat if you like that stuff your enemies melt split in half and explode when you hit them right
it also has a lot of amusing dark humor that parodies s television and the nuclear war scares of that erathe cons
the inventory system could have been better
the inventory screen is small so you have to scroll down the screen when you have a lot of items
when you are loaded up with items this takes a long time
the skill and attribute system lacks balance
the game is very combatoriented so noncombat skills arent very usefulfallout ii was a big disappointment
i quit playing early on for a few reasons
for one the plot is lousy
you are the chosen one charged with finding a religious artifact
blech
the story was just too dumb to be enjoyable
the game is filled with ghosts and weird little beasties and other nonsense that wasnt in fallout i  the science fiction genre is totally spoiled
and for some strange reason fallout ii is filled to the brim with excess profanity
this sequel adds nothing of value to the originalin summary the fallout iii dualjewel gives you one great classic rpg and one coaster
its cheap and its a great deali just completed fallout one
it is great game although some skills are uselessi began w perception  and intelligence  and i lacked action  points
i lacked one point of strength to use large energy weapons and carry enough or two
check faqs and i had to get power armor early in order to get  strength bonusi got small guns up to  and lockpick around  near beginning
it is good to have repair  too but that you can build laterenergy weapons are essential esp when you find alien blaster and it is good to have it at  percent esp before military basedont put skill points in melee weapons or fistfight you will not use it at allthere are much ways to finish fallout  but minor spoiler you can take out military base firs forget field disabling there is bug in game get robe there get in cathedral and go up and find key or have lockpick skill at   which is usefull later and go to basementnever throw lockpicks away
some stuff  like dynamite and plastic explosives were useless as far as i went thru game
it is good to have small and micro fusion cells
always collect stimpacks and in battle go to inventory and click them and use them by highlighting open hand thats the way u can use em as many as u wantthe best weapons are desert eagle sub machine gun sniper plasma rifle laser rifle for range gatling lasers and alien blaster if ure luckyend is unexpected fallout is sequel to fallout   and not so cool since solutions were more logical in fallout  here you can use muscular guy with spear and all skills can have use if you combine them
you also must have computers and lockpick around  percent as far as i remember
sniper rifle is cool and you get real weapons after you complete  percent of gameyou can use small guns only there is rifle that packs mean punch although its not laser or big gun classend is satiricalfallout  is more like extension of fallout  with more to do than a game of its own butits good and its second best old school rpg on pc as far as i knowbuy
its cheap and i beat fallout  on win xpand one more thing you can adjust difficulty level although normal is ok and you can turn off blood swearing and violent animationsdying scenes a la mortal kombat in battleswhy didnt i rate this game five star
well because of final fantasy vii ff ix playstations persona and older games that started it allbards tale that appeared on commodore  and pc and eye of beholder for lamented amiga and old pcsa nice addition to the myst world and a relief for those of us who wanted to see what the ship looked like coming out of the water
some of the cut scenes were filmed anew which is a bit of a relief and theres a small added world rime as a prize for having won the game otherwise its all original stuff
if you didnt like myst you wont like this either but if youre a myst fan whos already finished myst  youll be pleasedmyst the game that sold over  million copies worldwide and is still considered one of the most popular games around
imagine yourself stranded on a deserted island and in order to get out of the island you have no choice but to explore the island
in the process of doing that you discover the dark secret of the islandin the original myst game in order to get around the beautiful surrealistic landscape it was just a simple mouse click on the static d image
to move left you click on the left of the screen to move right you click to the right of the screen and so on
it was like watching a slideshow
in realmyst the new version of myst all this has changedmyst was just like real life
you will never die and you have to solve many cleverly designed puzzles that are scattered all over the island
the puzzles are fun but can be frustrating at times
and the fact that you can never die is actually a plus point it takes out the frustration of solving the puzzlesin realmyst the storyline is the same however there is a new ending which is actually a bonus stage that was not included in the original myst
everything in realmyst is in d and real time
unlike most d games the textures of realmyst are strikingly realistic
realmyst also features real time that means that night will turn into day and there will be weather changes
all these new features and the freedom to move around and look in any direction that you wishwill fully immerse you into the rich and surrealistic world of mystrealmyst could have been better if not for the steep system requiremnts
even on the the fastest computers it runs slowoverall realmyst is a game worth playing but if you are looking for something fast and exciting this is not the game for youbefore there was grand theft auto iiips xbox there was driver  when i was younger i would sit around for hours playing this game on my brothers psone
sadly some of that fun i once felt has worn off in the wake of owning games like grand theft auto iii vice city san andreas saints row and crackdown which have vastly improved the car theft and missions seen in games today
however even though these games made the formula more fun i still like to go back and play this game just to crash cars steal cars and get chased by the incompetent police forces in the game
the controls are at times a little wonky the camera kinda sucks the character is slow at moving and the music lacks any kind of pulse
this game is still fun despite being aged and having the problems that plagued many psone games and is easily recommendable to someone who enjoys grand theft autotype gamesim not a big fan of driving games but you cant go wrong with driver   the great storyline and movie clips gives you a strong purpose to drive like a madman
the thing i enjoyed most about the game is its attention to geographical detail
they have  cities for their stories and one being chicago
living in chicago i enjoyed driving like a nut around wrigleyville and downtown while having the cops chase after me
very reminscent of the blues brothersanyway the feel of the game is great
use an analog controller and youll see that control of the car is very good
also the ability to get out of your car and walk around is another great feature
you can stop other carsbusesvans and drive them to complete your mission
also you can walk into various buildings as well
you really have the feeling that anything goes and it doesthis is a great game whether you love driving games or not
pick it up nowdriver  is a good game
first of all the idea of getting out of your car and stealing another is great
also the levels are huge
the graphics are ok but nothing really special
during movie sequences though  the graphics are good
dont get fooled by it saying multiplayer its not great
you cant get out of your car there are no civilians and you can only play half of a level
but in the end driver  is a good game and i recommend it to anyonedark cloud is not a heavy plot driven rpg like you would expect from final fantasy or breath of fire
it is more or less a splice between zelda and sim city
the object of the game is to search dungeons the world over to find bits and pieces of your destroyed village
once you find the pieces you must rebuild the village
the grid system is similar to sim city because of the layout which seemed very familiar to me
i like the whole concept of the game which makes it a winner in my booksthe graphics are great despite those who say that the graphics are subpar
the environments are well detailed and the character animation is very well done
the music is the games biggest weakness
it is mainly background music that doesnt stick in your mind like the music in ffx or maximo
it also would have been nice to have some voice acting simply because the ps can handel it
some people might complain that the characters and enemies look quotcartoonyquot but it didnt bother me one bit
remeber quotocarina of timequot
everyone loved that game and dark cloud is quite similar to thatthe battle system is realtime similar to zelda and maximo
people who dont like the random battles with enjoy the battle system here and controlling the characters is a breeze
the ingame map is also quite nice and it avoids the hassel of getting lost all the time
i am not the most attentive gamer and this is a common problem for meso who would i recommend dark cloud to
almost everyone i know since it has rpg elements but not the lengthy battles and cinematics to put off people who are not rpg fans
rebuilding the village is a nice twist and it becomes quite engrossing
enjoyi love rpgs so when i heard about dark cloud i decided to check it out
everybody was touting it to be the next zelda except for the ps
well they were right
it was like playing zelda on the ps yet its story made it stand out on its own
there were too many zelda similarities to be honest but i thought that dark cloud was a great game
the graphics were lush and the georama thing was a neat additionfor a  price tag right now you cant do too bad for an rpg with dark cloud
rent it out but i bet youll be getting it once you play into it real good
i did anyhooi rented dark cloud and had some fun playing it but i was disappointed that it didnt offer something completely new
the dungeon crawler aspect has been done many times even with the collect items to rebuild the town feature
despite great graphics and gameplay this familiarity brought down the game a few notches in my opinionthe game basically plays like this you have a dungeon and a town accompanying it to save the town you must explore all the levels of the dungeon usually around  defeat monsters collect items and rebuild the town as the townspeople see fit by placing certain buildings in certain places
a nice twist is the number of allies you can switch to after certain points in the game rather than having the same character for the entire journeybut the repetitive nature of the dungeons dragged the game down
i got bored of playing five levels in a row which were all basically the samei still liked dark cloud a lot i was just hoping for a fresher concept
if i see the game available for a price in the pricerange ill consider buying itdark cloud is a good game that falls short of great
the graphics are incredible and the game has the feel of an almost fullyrealized world
unfortunately the gameplay just isnt up to the level of the visuals
i do love the town building aspect of the game but the repetitive dungeon crawling gets old fast
i also dont care for the weapon hp system where weapon status must be constantly monitored at the risk of permanently losing a weapon you have spent hours building upthen there is the design aspect of the characters and the world they inhabit and to a great extent the gameplay itself
could they possibly have been any more derivative of zelda
im not a huge zelda fan although i did play through the first n title but i was seriously put off by how much the creators of dark cloud seem to have quotborrowedquot from the zelda formuladespite these negative or otherwise depending on your point of view aspects i found dark cloud to be strangely addictive because of its major positive aspectthe town building mode which is really cool
thats why i give the game four stars and not the three it would get otherwisea whole lotta dungeons
dungeons and chests are randomly generated
weapons will break but theres enough repair powder in the game to prevent this
weapons build up is interesting but takes forever
whats unique is to rebuild townsvillages in their proper place to satisfy the locals
fishing in ponds was different  in a way fun but i did fall asleep fishing one time
the tediousness is doing the same thing over and over again dungeon fightingfishing
wasnt bad but i can understand those that got bored
i liked this game
had some good ideas
dark cloud  was a better game with an added cameragolf gamerobot but still the same mechanicsok so the graphics are definitely launch quality and the dungeons are repetitious but the sheer old fashioned fun of this title make up for these faults
i loved collecting parts for then building the towns and the satisfaction in the weapon development is superb
this game is a great value and is sure to provide many hours of funweve all heard it previews of dark cloud by people and magazines hinting at the possibility of it being the quotzelda killerquot  but come on
did anybody really believe that
is that even possible
maybe a big maybe square or rare could make such a game but sony
not a chance
and its true dark cloud isnt even close to zelda
but wait dont think that its a bad game in fact its the best rpg for the playstation  so farill tell you right off not to expect much out of this game except for gameplay
graphics are just average for what the ps can create and there are no lighting effects whatsoever
sure you have a good looking shadow in the shape of your character but the positions of torches and other external lights have no effect on its movement
music too is average and sounds okay its just bad when the music doesnt quite fit the situation
for instance early on your village is being destroyed to the accompaniment of music that almost seems heroic or cheerful
finally the game has a simple and boring story with characters that are only briefly developed and dialogues hampered by careless translation
one minute you think her names gina and the next minute someone calls her xena warrior princess
now with all the bad out of the way lets go on to the goodthe gameplay
okay this is going to sound bad dark cloud is about  dungeoncrawling
but hey
so was vagrant story and it was phenomenal
okay so it also had a great story to back it up but hear me out
your mission is to travel through deep dungeons looking for quotatlasquot which hold parts of destroyed villages that you get to recreate
ill get to the village creation part shortly
in the dungeons youll find a good variety of monsters to do battle with and each time you hit a monster your weapon will take damage
if it takes too much damage make sure to repair it with some quotrepair powderquot or it will break and then you have lost it for good
also youll want to keep an eye on your thirst gauge
if you dont use an item to quench your thirst or find a pool of water before your thirst meter empties youll start losing health if youve ever played a dungeon explorer youll recognize this as similar to the food element that game imposed upon its players
these two things make the game kind of addictive like watering your crops and taking care of your cows in harvest moonsimilarly to vagrant story you get to customize your weapons
youll get items in your quest such as quotattack quot or quotendurance quot that you can put on your weapon to increase its attributes attack of course determines how much damage the weapon inflicts and endurance determines how much damage it takes each time it hits an enemy
the five elementsfire ice wind thunder and holycan also be found and attached to a weapon to increase its elemental strength
icebased enemies are weak against fire weapons undead are weak against holy weapons etc
other items such as quotbeast busterquot and quotstone breakerquot will make the weapon more powerful against ordinary beasts and stone or rock enemies respectively
after so many battles weapons will be able to upgrade and absorb any items attached to them giving you the option to put items on them yet again and power them up even further until the next upgrade
so if i want the ultimate weapon against stone enemies i could keep putting on quotstone breakersquot and maybe slip in an quotendurance quot every now and then because stone enemies really damage your weapons
and lets say i wanted to make another one of my weapons super against the undead i could keep giving it quotholyquotbut i dont have any more
time to do some treasurehuntingexploring for treasure in the game is really fun thanks to dark clouds random dungeons
even if you revisit a floor of a dungeon that you have already cleared its layout will be random and all new treasure chests will have regenerated
if youre lucky you may even be able to visit quotback floorsquot of dungeons where rarer treasures await but greater enemies lurkremember those quotatlasquot i spoke of
well in each one youll find a piece of a destroyed village such as a house river or any of several miscellaneous objects that go inside the houses
with these pieces you can start to rebuild a village any way you want itwell kind of
you are restricted somewhat by what the villagers want
some like the smell of food so you put them near the house of a good cook others enjoy fishing so you put them next to water others just dont like a person so you keep them away
but if you please the villagers youll often get a reward
i found it kind of neat to decorate the villages and it gives a nice break from all the dungeoncrawling the restrictions imposed by the villagers requests even give a kind of puzzle element to the gamezelda is still king of actionrpgs but for now dark cloud is the pss king of the genre
i wasnt expecting a zelda when i purchased dark cloud so i wasnt disappointed but if thats what you expected you probably wont be too happy
give it a chance though and its addictive gameplay will hook youdark cloud is a very interesting game with neat graphics and great replayability
it only has a few flaws the greatest of which is goro
the majority of the characters in the game are wellrounded which is a good thing because the game forces you use to use all of your allies at some point
with toan xiao  and ruby you could hardly term this forcing you at all but goro is a another story all together
he is slowmoving both in terms of running and in terms of attacking and he has a long recovery time especially in comparison to littlemissrapidfire xiao
basically i would give this game  stars if this one character didnt exist
other than my issues with goro i really dont like the fact that your inventory space is so limited in this game
but it is challenging and fun and the georama parts provide a nice break from the firstperson fighting action of it all
overall this game is worth the price you shell out for it and it will keep you busy until you either get addicted to ephemeral fantasia or final fantasy x comes outim a huge zelda fan and was looking for something similar on the ps
dark cloud combines a very linklike character with dungeon crawl combat quest solving and mini games toothe main thrust of the game is that youre trying to rebuild a series of homes destroyed by the evil enemy
to do so you go slogging through nearby dungeons finding homebits like beds lamps and so on on your adventures
when you bring them back to town you have to figure out which items to where to please the people
in addition the houses themselves have to be placed so that the people are happy
some people want to live near a stream some want to have morning sun in certain windows and so onyour weapons can be customized as you go and need to be maintained
this gives you a bit of rpglike control over your life more in fact than most zelda games provide to youin addition there are some fun minigames which help break up the dungeon crawling and give you a bit of varietythe games provides much longer gameplay time usually several weeks than many other ps games on the market meaning its a good value for the price
perhaps the only downsides are the graphics which arent topnotch and the dungeon crawling being a bit tedious after several hours
still its a good fun game to play
grab one for your ps libraryi really liked this game
i was bright and colorful but not too childish
i liked the fact that the point of the game was to retrieve parts of the world and reconstruct it with clues from the inhabitants
the weapon ungrade options were inovative and highly creative
i liked that you could switch between the characters all of which have different abilities and weapons
then there is the fishing
i like that you can take time out to fish and win point that can be exchanged for gems and attribute stones
i played this game for days on end
the monsters got a little repetative and the maps were all the same but i still found this game highly enjoyablemost have said that entering dungeon after dungeon is boring but it is actually very fun putting together the towns and interacting with them
you must move through the dungeons to get pieces of the town and once you come out you can put together what you found
dark cloud has great graphics sound and overall gameplay
the only things that annoyed me was the need for water if you get to thirsty your life declines and the fact that your weapons are breakable  you get magic to fix weapons but early in the game it is hard to accuire money plus you need to find the store by fighting in the dungeons which breaks your weapons  wow seems complicated  my advice is to go and get this game the battle system might not be much but the town building portion of the game is very funif you liked zelda for the n youll like this game
its kind of kidfriendly as far as graphics and characters but the gameplay gets pretty deep when reconstructing the towns
its a fun lighthearted rpg that you get your  worth fromits hard to rate a game thats out so ill have to go on what i have seen
the bits that i have seen in magazines and on the interenet are making me want this game so bad
all i willsay is that i wish they would hurry up and release this game asapto look at this game  your first impression might be to compare dark cloud to the zelda series
you would not be far off the mark in doing so
fans of the nintendo series will likely feel right at home in this dungeon crawling environmentit also harkens back to the days of actraiser  a game where you fought to reclaim lands and then build them using your magic
dont be fooled  the premises may be form other games  but dc is great in its own rightit is toans task to rebuild his world from pieces called atla  found stashed away in various levels of the dungeons you encounter
enter the dungeons  tackle the flow of monsters  and reclaim the pieces you need to restore your world  but dont run out of water  and dont let your weapon breakthe combat system is a bit awkward  but nothing that cant be dealt with
the realtime system  weapons damageupgrade system  and the water system are all interesting concepts
at points the can be tiring the heroes getting tirsty every few minutestake a drink before you enter the dungeon or something  but also fun conceptswepaons can be upgraded and merged  strengthening in the process  provided you dont break them in combat first
the ingame tutorial is boring and unskippable  which is annoying to those of us who actually read the manual and know what to dodo not let minor flaws distract you  this is a fun game  perhaaps one of the best ive played in the rpg genregood after you stop you cant stop then you stop and go againbad you push x over and over to attacksome rounds make you use  playerthe cat thing disappoints so you take up weeks to build up her slingshotmonsters disappointsto easy to beet bossessome times you wana beet the stuff out of charictorsdark cloud is one of the premiere roleplaying games to hit the playstation  but it isnt your ordinary final fantasylike rpg
the story places you in a world where a dark cloud hence the title has imprisoned and transformed every living being on the planet
for mysterious reasons our hero is the only one spared and it is his task to singlehandedly rebuild the world
 create geographical landscapes using the new georama feature system
 create a village complete with houses hills churches volcanoes streams and villagers
youll even have the ability to control the weather
 assume the role of a young innocent hero named toran
 uninterrupted and instantaneous quotrealtimequot gameplaythis fresh game promises to deliver what you crave  strategy battles and puzzles
but in addition you can also create geographical landscapes using the new georama feature system
dark cloud is definitely a game youll want to explorethe gameplay system will be reminiscent to squares legend of mana where you can use objects to create entire worlds but herein lies the difference none of legend of manas creation is done in real time
the camera angles will be in mario  fashion or an overhead perspective but you will be able to roam the entire world with a full  degrees of movement in a large intricate and beautiful worldthis is a great divice but it does not work well with some games like final fantasy anthology it does not work well with games that are not solid but it works well with valkyrie  profilea game that is solid
there is a good chance that the game shark will  screw with the game like in lunar sssc when i use codes or have used codes when i talk to people and supposed to get an item from them i dont get  the item from them things like that
i would say the game shark is worth the money but if there  is a game shark code and a programerers cheat that does the same thing i use the programers cheat instead it is more reliableif you are like me you bought a playstation  almost immediately upon arrival and have been waiting for this game since
well let me tell you i purchased my copy july th as soon as it came out
it is a great game
but much like a de la soul album a terry gilliam movie or my moms lasagna it just doesnt live up to my ridiculous expectations
the games graphics are amazing but not completely different from what we have seen on the system
game play is virtually identical from the nd version on the ps
so what we have is the best version of something we have all seen a million times
not the revolutionary piece of manna i had hoped for
sigh
that said this is clearly a must purchase game for fans of sim racing who want to spend the time learning
it is certainly the best game in its class for this system
again let me restate
this is a great game
the one mode that is significantly better this time around is the ralley mode
it is a thrill to screech through the dust trail of a car in front of you
consider the fact that you are getting a pure racer and one of the best rally games at the same time and you will see why you need this game
one word of caution  if you want a game you can jump right in with this might not be it most of the courses and cars must be unlocked
this will be fun for gt fans but could frustrate the pure noviceif youre a fan of racing games go ahead and buy this one
its got justbarelyphotorealistic graphics and slick gameplay
and the real highlight of the game is the quotsimulationquot mode where you earn money for winning races and you spend the money on better cars and equipmenti took off a star from my rating because theres no crashing in the game
cars just bounce harmlessly off walls and other cars
i wanna be able to break stuffthis is a fun game
if youve been following the gran turismo series youll be impressed with this new version
the cars are amazing and the graphic details is brilliant
the soundtrack could use a little work but its not too bad
this game is great for all agesexcellent graphics excellent game play improved difficulty
this game has it all but  its much more difficult to obtain money on the simulation mode
fewer cars than its predessor also detracts a bit from the game
they really should have included used cars to help get started
the menus are cleaned up but you still have to back out of your menu when you buy a new part
i would have given it  stars but the difficulty in earning money initially detracts a bit from the experience
it is however the most remarkably realistic game ive ever had the pleasure to play
very highly recommended purchasei bought my playstation  a few months ago excited by the hype
so far ive been sorely disappointed by the variety and quality of the games available
ive enjoyed onimusha and moto gp and that has been it up until gran turismo  this game is stunning
the graphics are incredible
i played a demo of gran turismo  on a disc from a playstation magazine and the graphics on that game are like comparing steamboat willy to akira
the cars are beautifully rendered and the lighting effects are outstanding
as far as gameplay this is a well balanced game
i consider myself a novice gamer with some middle level skill
this game isnt frustratingly hard or boringly easy
the challenge progresses easily and naturally
the earlier stages of the game are more fun because the cars are slower and a little more skill is involved
the analog controls really capture the feel of gravel crunching under your wheels in the rally races
theres a lot of fun involved in tuning the cars and each car handles with its own unique personality
my favorites are the tvr speed  and the ford gt road car
most people into racing games probably already own this title if you are new to video games or you arent really a fan of racing but dont mind it i would highly recommend this game
its worth the money and will keep you entertained for weeksi like this game a lot
the games delivered on a dvdrom giving slick graphics and lots of long driving musicyou can tell they spent the extra time polishing this little puppy for the stores
that being said the graphics are overly done the car seems to float in front of the groundbackgroundobviously apart and the music is overly prepared  better than the gt music but not quite approaching the intensity and just roadlust of the firstgameplay is much better than the second but still lacking something from the first
they removed the different car vendors you simply go to one place on the map and the quottune up shopquot means you go only one place for parts and  personally  i miss the feel of quotshopping aroundquot
also for the first car and in arcade mode the gameplay feels sluggish if i rated after first day  starsbut that improves as you beef up your carstick with it it gets better
this stays in my top  ps titles so farthis is the racing game for ps  great for parties or just playing alone  and can teach one about physicsa solid purchase  worth the money this game like all the others in the gran turismo series is a really great game
many available cars lots of tracks hours of fun
there are a couple of noticable flaws though in this edition
first theres only  bmw in the game
yeah   i as well as many other gt fans were hoping for more bmws than in gt especially the addition of the m new m and m roadster for purchase and the original m from  as a car to win
the second problem is the amount of time it can take to get anywhere in this version
with less of a used car system than in gt you are stuck buying less to begin with and it takes even longer to get a car that will win you some races and some money
while it could be said that this extends the game its really more of an annoyance
those issues aside this is a great game amazing graphics and a lot of funwelli bought the playstation  for one reason onlyive waited what seems like forever to play the the game gran turismo  on the new playstation  and i have had  disapointments
not only did the new playstation not get the game soul bladesoul caliberperhapes in my opionion the greatest fighting game ever but now i find it hard to tell witch is better gran turismo  or ya the graphics are a bit spiffier but not all that much like every body is claiming
it looks almost the same compare them if you dont beleive me
and whats worse is the cars look slower while drivinglike as if it had to slow the game down to handle the graphics
i still like the gameim still playing it for  days now since it came outbut i just wanted to say i expected alot more from the play station  witch ive waited so long to getbecuz of availability and price
im still crossing my fingers on soul caliber
and gran turismo  will hopefully be the game of next yearfirst let me say gran turismo  is the best racingsim game on the market for any console
it is graphically without peer and the whole audiovisual experience is breathtaking
the cars are rendered perfectly and the replays are absolutely unbelievable it is the only game besides mgs that makes me respect the graphical power the ps possesses
i have a few complaints though
first for all of the graphical overhauls the ai has stayed stagnant the drivers seem to just follow the same line everytime
i expected a lot more work on this aspect as i thought that was the main weakness of the previous  gran turismos
the only other complaint is the cars that are available
there are obvious no shows like porsche and ferrari but i would have liked to have seen some more consumer level cars
there are a few but not as many as i had expected
but those are my only complaints it is a supremely fun game with many racing options and modes
from the hyperlong endurance races to the maximum speed loop there is something for everyone in this game
its well worth the money and one of only a few games worth owning on the psgreat graphics and sound
so many cars and modes
very difficult
after doing so much racing is more of a chore than fun
very fun with a steering wheel
tight controlsthis game is unique in every way
first off the graphics
that is what got my attention in the first place
second the cars my favorite of all the chrysler
third the courses all liscenced and realistic
there are many features in this game like sunday drives championship races classic car drive shows rally and tune shop
more and more are available to say but i aint got that much time
well if you liked this game or youre thinking about buying it get gt instead
this game is great as far as im concerned but gt is the advanced version and has twice the features this game has
plus it claims to have ferrarris motor bikes and drag racingi love this game but with that said i want to get the bad stuff out of the wayless carsmany lessa lot of my favorites have gone the way of the dodo
 cars to start with with a few more added later is a lot but when compared to four to five times that in gt it pales in comparisondumb aisure the computer cars are a little more quotintelligentquot than before but when a random car that had never been touched slams its brakes effectively taking it out of the race just to stop the player then their is work to be done besides this all cars still follow a racing line albeit not as religiously as before
ai
could be betterno damageunderstandably the manufacturers will not allow the gt producers to portray their perfect cars as anything less than thatie
no scratches or dents in these work machines but slamming a wall at kmh plusi have japanese version will have repurcussions
i will gripe and gripe until this is correctedno working headlightsi will give my right eye for a left one that can see the road
why turn on the  headlights at all
the street lights obviously do an adequate job
the headlights look pretty but do nothing
yes this is a minor gripe but simple physics is not too much to ask for
arghokwith that out of the way time for the goodgraphicsobviously being the first thing one will notice the graphics are phenomonal
sure the audience remains a cardboard cutout and the rear view mirror does not present all the fixinsvery generic but with these being the only flaws this game is truly a sight to behold
the lighting is extremely impressivei was actually blinded by the sun and the textures are right on
i have read of texture lighting problems but have yet to experience any
all the touches are in the right places
and the replaysbeautifulmusicagain sony got different bands for the soundtracklike lenny kravitz feeder grand theft audio overseerit really keeps you motivated
although i do like the music in gt a bit betterone of the best video game soundtracks ever this music was still right onmore raceseven more races including the gt rally races and some f racing this time the race options are amazingimproved physicsnot a very noticeable change as gt had great physics but a significant one at that
rear and mid engine cars do not flair as wildly out of control as in the past and the new wet ground physics are great
the pinball action off the side rails remains howeverrunning out of space i realize there is a lot to say about this game and it is an extremely enjoyable experience
granted the time to make each car model limited the selection this time around but there are still more cars than any other ps racer
try it out and seeespecially if you have never played a gran turismo gameyou are sure to enjoythis game is awsome
you really get a sense of speed because of the sounds of the engine
i dont think the graphics could be really any better
the cars are ones that you could probably just see on the road if you went to the grocery store right now but i think thats an awsome part of this game
so if the game is so great why only  stars
well thats because i could do without the license mode and you have to go through too many races with a car that isnt very good at all before you can get a car like a mustang svt cobra
but thats ok because all the rest of this game is sweet
so i highly reccomend to get this game
its the best game i own for ps and i have like  of them
so buy it from here or somewhere else cuz i gauruntee if you have any desire at all to race exotic cars through cool courses that youll be addicted to this gameok first its great there are alot of improvements from the last  games
its easier to tune your car
you have traction control which is good if you like that kind of thing i dont great graphics blah blah blahoh and thankfully the license tests are easier and the naviagation is alot easier when youre buying a car from the second oneok the bad no used cars
which is a real pooper
i had to start out with a miata i hate those cars
second you guys remember the really cool hot rides and classics like the  covette stingray the charger and the othercars
you dont get them
i want my stingray
i loved it
and by the way id rather race one of those than some stupid exotic sports cars those things are just average to me
oh well
buy it used dont pay full price
but if you cant wait youll like it anyway
and if you arent used to traction control turn it offgt is a really good game period
the graphics are very good except for a few race tracks where buildings appear out of nowhere and very fuzzy grandstands
this license exams are very challenging and take great skill to even pass the tests so dont even think about getting all golds right away took me forever to get all golds on all licenses
there are some unrealistic factors though
if your car is the same car as a computer racer there car is way more faster so on races where only one car is allowed modifications are needed on cars
it is definately a good game and has excellent replay value
if you dont have this game yet get this before you get resident evil code veronica x or any other hot new game out theregrand turismo  gt has the best graphics of any racing game in the world and has the coolest cars since supercar street challenge
 however gt may get on your nerves sometimes when racing in a season because of the large chances of spinningout and the hardtooppose ai difficultiesalso if youre into crashburn racing games like the burnout series for ps then this game wouldnt be for youhowever gt is still the coolest racing and nonburnout type ps games ive ever playedgreat game the graphics are out of this world the feel of the car while driving is second to noneafter playing this game every other racing game seems like a bad version of pole positionif youre into racing this game is definitely it there is nothing on the market that even comes close
gt along with the ff series are the reasons why you buy the playstation systemsthis is just like any other grand turismo games it is hard and it takes forever to beat the game
this is the first one on ps so the graphics r allot better than other ps games
it has many songs on it but i only like one of them
it does not have as many cars as the newer ones but it has tons compared to other racing games
the background is really good too
there r many cars to choose from and the multiplayer is really fun
that is about it for this game but it has a great multiplayer and really good graphicsalright this is yet so far the best realisticsimulation driving game in the whole entire world yet so farmove over xbox graphics im no xbox hater since i have it and come in gran turismogt is yet far the most impressive simulation ever seen in peoples livesgameplay this is a great game for all your peeps that keeps it realisticbut i hate the fact that its too realthe cars really dont move fast as far as other racing simulation but this beats the heck out of every realistic drivinggraphics even thou the xbox has a better processor gran turismo is the best graphiced game ever
at least one of itvalueits worth the great a ride but it is missing the gameplaybecause i hate straight simulators
and everybody i spoke to i asked which game had the more arcade feel they kept pointing to gt
i kept going back in my mind thinking what if these people possibly first time gamers or conversions from the pc gaming world didnt know what i meant by arcade
what if they interpreted arcade as simply a game
i would use the ridge racer series as an example of a true arcade racer and it felt that i was losing some people in the explanationthis purchase was a tough one
since ive played racing sims before and as far as i was concerned they were toooooooooo in depth and technical to keep my attention
and the control on some seemed tooooooo realistic to the point of being restrictive keeping your sense of fun in checkat first this sort of confirmed every suspicion i had about the gt series
the cars were hard to control presicely
things seemed restrictivethat is until i started earning credits and blindly upgraded my rides to the best they can be im still not up on fine tuning them since i dont know that the heck id be doing
right now the best ride i have is a chrysler pt cruiser
no i havent purchased a million  ride yet
the obsession with winning more races to buy more cars and the slackjaw enducing racing because youre so focused on steering and fine pushing the gas with the analog buttons keep one coming back for more
and if there is a significant gap in time before you can get back to it it can be intimidating because youre not sure if you remember how to drive the gt way by controllerinstead of being pure arcade racer this is a mix of arcade and sim
the control is forgiving enough to enjoy the game yet challenging enough to beat your head in primal frustration and utter more than  types of curse wordsbut i still like my arcade racers where you can get right into it without having to worry if your car is tuned up well enough
outrun  on the xbox has my attention now and the demo i played of that was magnificent
too bad its for the xbox thoughgt is a very good racer but beware of the hype
i own gt and moto gp on ps and several dreamcast racers
and frankly gt has some serious competition such as metropolis street racer on dreamcast
you simply dont hear too much about msr because of the limited size of the dreamcast market
if it had been a ps game thoughregardless gt does excel graphically
the combination of fps speed detailed highpolygon cars and true reflective surfaces is impressive
dreamcast racers always have  of the  but rarely all of them
the stages are mostly supremely enhanced variations of those in gt and generally impress
here however most not just some dc racers beat gt especially in texture detail
blessedly the welldocumented ps quotjaggiesquot are basically eliminated in gt in marked contrast to my beloved but quotjaggyquot moto gpgameplaywise theres a lot here as is to be expected of the series
but be prepared to be initially underwhelmed if youre an old hand at gt or gt
gt plays almost exactly like the earlier games and can sometimes feel like a boring expensive deja vu
gamers new to the series will either marvel at the simulation aspect or hate it since it requires lots of deicated braking and turning unlike a pickup and powerslide ridge racer gamefinally there are some great cars to drive here but the licensing is oddly hit and miss with many many ommissions from gt
its great to see a beautifully modeled c vette here and the exotic pagoni zonda
then you get a fun pt cruiser but no neons on which it is based yes the pt cruiser is a neon underneath
you get only  fiat the coupe a racing gillet but not the production car 
 only ruf variants of porsches automotive enthusiasts want an honest bhp boxster s to drive not a  bhp ruf
no production ford focus like gt but the rally car is still here
at least the british tvrs are still here as it wouldnt be gran turismo without themoh well
gt is not perfect i havent mentioned the lineofsightobstructing outside car view the inability to adjust music volume and not a star game
know that going in and youll have a very good time with itgrand turismo was the first ps game i had ever bought
i saw that it was on the top charts and was wanting to get it before any other ps game
the gameplay is pretty fun on simulation mode in other words  player
 player mode is very hard in the beginning if you havnt practiced so i recommend that you play arcade mode where you are just race for fun on a few different race tracksthe graphics are really good
if your car gets out of control it looks real the way it spins out
the trail of smoke that the car right ahead of you leaves behind is very realistic because it also blinds your view sometimesthe cars in the game have mostly the same amount of power but just different looks
there is great variety of cars to choose fromthe only thing about this game i didnt enjoy was that if you wanted to play  player or more with someone you could only choose from a few race tracks to race on
and all the dirt tracks are only you and the other player
so there are no other computer racers in the game which means your either in last or first
the simulation mode  player you go to all sorts of different tracks which makes it less boringanother cool thing about the game is that after you start getting good at  player mode you will recieve money and you can buy cars and other parts to make your car event bettergameplaygraphicsshould you buy this
 this has to honestly be one of the best racing games i have ever played on the ps
the graphics are spectacular and the game play is so realistic
the amount of cars and the variety of the cars is incredible
this has to be one of the most realistic games that i have ever played on any gaming system
overall i think this is a must have for the ps and now that it is this price how could you go wrong
buy itthis game is a challengingbut very funif u hav alots of free timein the game its very hard  make turns u either crash into walls or get hit by cars behind u cause u stopped  long
to make the game more entaining  i suggest u buy a driving wheel it makes the game alot more funin the gamethere are  modes u can playarcade mode and simulation modethe acrcade mode is a waste of time if your playing by your self cause it the simuation mode has everything arcade mode has and even more
in the simuation mode you can buy cars and tune it with credits 
u get it by winning races
when beginning the simuation u get  credits and enter either  the beginner leagueamateur leaguepro league rally events or the endurance races
differnet competition requires different license where u hav  take these different test  license centerit is very hard
occasionally u hav  hav a car wash or oil change  the gt auto but ur car will b fine without itoverall this game is funbut it takes alot of pratice to master ithope it helpsgran tursimo  surely does take racing game graphics to a new level but the gameplay is pretty much the same as the previous gran tursimo franchise
the cars are great amid the fact that they are fewer in number than gt and gt
spectacular effects such as water dust and smoke are stunning
if you lovedand im stressing on loved gt and gt then get this
if not dontone of the best tower defense titles for the psp im sure
its simple and easy to get the hang of while still having solid playabilitysonic  and sonic and knuckles were originally going to be released as one game but it ended up being cut into two games
sonic  when compared to sonic  and  is a major step
with more options for verses mode and saving ability sonic  introduced a lot more options for sonic gaming funthe game also introduces the character knuckles the echidna whom of which is the guardian of angel island where dr robotnik eggman lands after his defeat from sonic  dr robotnik manages to convince knuckles that sonic and tails are the ones who want to cause trouble so knuckles often gets in the way and makes things difficult for sonic and tails during the entire game
in verses mode you can play as knuckles as well as sonic or tailsin the usual game you can play as sonic and tails sonic alone or tails alone
one thing i really like about sonic  as opposed to sonic  is that tails can fly which often gives him a great advantage over playing sonic
when you do  player with sonic and tails tails can often fly sonic to high places but its not a long time before tails gets tiredlevels the levels are big and often challenging usually taking a long time to complete
however one of the reasons why sonic  is flawed in my opinion is that there are very few levels  including the final boss which is not a separate level from the last which is a small number compared to its predecessors sonic  had  levels not including the final zone but keep in mind that the levels in sonic  have  zones not just two sonic  had  levelsgrade best level ice cap zone level graphics beautiful and clear much improved over sonic grade bonusemerald rounds the idea of a bonus round is introduced with sonic  with the new bonus round the gumball round you have a chance to get more ringslivesshields
its often a quick escape from a potentially bad situation
the emerald rounds are also new basically consisting of sonic or tails having to gather up blue spheres and not touch the red spheres in order to get the emeralds
i find that those emerald rounds are generally easier than the ones in sonic  or  which i am not a big fan of at allgrade characters sonic and tails sonic and tails
knuckles as well in the verses mode
not too bad a lineup i believegrade music i dont really like the music in sonic  most of it i believe lacks the catchiness of the music from sonic  or sonic and knuckles
i believe that hydrocity zone and the ice cap zone themes have their charms but nothing really stands out as being all that good
thankfully the music was improved a lot in sonic and knuckles
however an interesting thing that is new with sonic  is that the themes for the different levels change slightly for the different zones of the level for instance the theme for hydrocity act  is slightly different then the theme for hydrocity act  often you have to really listen to the themes to hear the differences but they are there
this trend adheres to sonic and knuckles as wellgrade bosses i find the bosses for sonic  to be extremely difficult at times
they are much more difficult than the bosses in sonic  which can often be beaten in a matter of seconds
the bosses in sonic  take a lot of patience
even some of the bosses in sonic and knuckles i find are often easier than the ones in sonic  sometimes the bosses can be so difficult it can take a matter of rings and even lives to beat them
however the final boss i find is actually a little easier than expected
also for the first time in genesis gaming you are able to have rings to defeat the final bossgrade basically for sonic  the thing that was improved the most over sonic  was special features and graphics
not only did they add a verses round but they added more options such as time track try to beat your best time w separate characters
also the saving mode allows you to save where you left off from and also saves all your lives and continues
once youve completed the game you can go back and play any level you wish on your saved game
you may delete any saved game that you want at any time and you can even play no save
tails can fly which is an awesome feature
and another added bonus is the addition of shields to the game
in sonic  the only shield that existed was the protection shield good for one hit so sonic could be spared his rings or a life
however with sonic  three new shields replace the old protection shield
the flame shield protects sonic from any flame or fireinduced harm even lava
 the water shield protects sonic from drowning and is very useful in hydrocity and other levels since sonic  has a lot of water and the lightning shield which protects sonic from a lot of electric hazards and also attracts rings by magnet
sonic can do specialized moves with the shields but even when lacking a shield sonic can do an instashield which is useful when a hazard is near
tails can also use the shields but he cannot do specialized moves with themoverall sonic  is a great game but does lack in some departments
if you want a more intense gaming experience buy sonic  and sonic and knuckles together and play sonic  and knuckles
sonic  and knuckles is quite possibly the best sonic game ever and eliminates all the flaws of sonic  and sonic and knucklessonic the hedgehog 
the third official sonic game on the genesisfebruary  
hedgehog day as sega so bluntly stated in the commercials promoting the next sequel of the series
even alex trebeck used this bit of trivial information on an episode of jeopardy once
whatever all this means the sonic series had reached an alltime high with the major success of its classic sequel
if the first game introduced us to the next mascot in gaming then sonic  was the game that cemented segas reputation as a true bit giant in the early s
those were such great times living in an age with two great systems the genesis and the snes which spawned so many d classics that are still enjoyed err anyways enough reminiscing
after the d zenith of sonic  sega promised fans that they would followup with what was to be the biggest and best sonic game of the series
in the two year gap between official sequels the sega cd did churn out the much overlooked sonic cd a game which i hold in high regard yet it unfortunately became forgotten once a genesis sequel would emerge
the hype was as high as ever and things were looking extremely promising for this massive sequelhowever in an effort to meet deadlines and pack as much goodness into a sonic game as possible sega was forced into dividing sonic  in two separate parts the game we all know today as sonic  and also the rest of it packaged later on in the year into a special lock on cart known as sonic  knuckles
this aspect both pleased and angered some fans though standing alone sonic  holds up extremely well
it has enough new features to keep the older fans happy and anyone new to the series would find this game to be a great starting point
besides you can still play the full sonic  by popping this one on top of sk so its not like this scheme is avoided
just separated like puzzle pieces thats all
heres the scoop on sonic prosyou can make tails fly now
this is something im sure many fans complained about with sonic  so now as the second controllable character you actually have something to do
plus you can swim and lift sonic up to otherwise unreachable areas out of his grasp
pretty coolfantastic graphical upgrade
this means more scaling more colors and more fast paced actionhuge levels to explore
while there arent high quantities of levels in sonic  alone the quality of them is astounding
they are so big and expansive that you can easily get lost in some of them though there is always some sort of path to keep you on track
each level is roughly  times the size of any stage in sonic nice variety of shield powerups
the standard blue shield was kinda getting boring so sega thought to vary it up with a bubble shield that lets you breathe underwater and bounce
 a fire shield that does a scorch attack and the electric shield which provides a doublejump in addition to attracting rings like a magnet
the instashield trick is also a noteworthy series staplemore great music
sonic  is still king here with sonic cd and  right behind it but sonic  offers a bunch of memorable music
i particularly loved the hydrocity act  marble garden act  and the ice cap and launch base themesand speaking of ice cap zone this is the best zone in any sonic game
sega knew that all  of its previous games were missing an icethemed stage and what better way to introduce us than by having sonic ride down a slope on a fast snowboard
those were probably the greatest  seconds of any sonic gamegreat special stages
unlike the timebased ones of the  previous games sonic s sss offer a simple giant pseudod sphere grid in which you must collect all the blue spheres and avoid the red ones
while the other games stages seemed like you needed luck to win these ones are based more on skill which is a major plus
also these stages are much more accessible now in the gamethe bonus stages offer a nice change from the seriousness of the sss in that you dont have to win them just collect powerups etcnow you fight a boss at the end of every stage
none are too difficult but offer enough of a challenge to keep things interestinglastly the save feature is nice to haveconsvery few zones
 to be exact
this is of course understandable given what ive explained above but even if the stages are long the game itself still feels briefyou can easily tell that sonic  was meant to be larger
if the stage select menu didnt give it away then remember all those unbreakable walls that you see every so often
well maybe if another characterp mode is a slight disappointment
just run laps in very short zones
no playing through actual ingame levels or special stages like the ones in sonic big stages mean that the timer is a real pain in the arse for explorersoh and even though most of the music is great the carnival night zone theme drives me up the wall
trust me itll get very tedious after a few minutesby itself sonic  holds up to be a very solid entry but because it is clearly half a game ill only give it  stars
do yourself a favor and get both halves and play the sonic   knuckles adventure
it doesnt matter if you link the two genesis carts or get it through sonic mega collection
either way its the best way to experience it
gotta juicethat this game came with a save feature was a wonderful bonus as well as being able to play as sonic tails or both tails levitation abilities with his tail come in rather handy sometimes and the graphics for this one are just beautiful
the variety of bonus levels  different ones are enjoyable and the chaos emerald bonus levels are uniquely challenging
the save makes it nice since you can go back and try at more chances for chaos emeralds if you beat the game without getting all i would have given it  stars but at only  levels this game doesnt feel complete
only with the addition of the sonic and knuckles cartridge does the game then feel complete with a total of  levels and a new set of emerald bonus levels to try to win super emeralds with the s and k addition the game then merits  starsi actually played this game as part of the sonic mega collection disc for the nintendo gamecube but this was the one title that really elicited a strong reaction from me
as far as classic gaming goes sonic  is as much a keeper as its predecessors
its also much better than most of the modern day d sequels
but when you put sonic   and  side by side sonic  comes up shorttechnically the game is improved over sonic  much more colour a smoother graphics engine and niftier effects and animations
its the kind of look thats obviously dated by todays standards but still beautiful to look at
where sonic  comes up short is everywhere else
music is only soso
levels are much longer than the previous games taking almost  times as long to complete but theres actually very few of them
supposedly this and sonic and knuckles were originally  game but hacked apart so sega could make the release date
it shows and the real sonic  experience is when you lockon with the knuckles cartridge which doubles the levelsbut what really hurts sonic  in my opinion is how the environmental hazards are placed
the subtle difference between the first two games and this one is that while the first two encouraged you to blaze through the levels at top speed narrowly missing hazards sonic  changes the timing so that you will be hurt if you blaze through recklessly
see a long stretch
better walk instead of run because at the end of that stretch after youve collected all those rings some cheap enemy will suddenly appear and take everything from you
it happened to me multiple times and it really hurts the experience
for a game about speed it doesnt encourage you to speed at alloverall sonic  is a classic sega title and its worth checking out either on the original genesis or emulated on todays systems
its just that the games flaws are obvious when closely compared to the other twogreat game it is cool to play as the raptor swift and powerfulgrant is kind of lame they should have gave the raptor  more level to keep it evenjurassic park was a fantastic movie when it hit theaters
the wonder of dinosaurs with excellent animatronics and special effects coupled with solid acting and a fun scientific plot made this movie a major motion picture success
this was also around the time that many forms of entertainment that proved to be majorly successful mighty morphin power rangers teenage mutant ninja turtles star wars etc
would branch out into video games to further capitalize on commercial success and to appease a growing population of video game players
jurassic park was no exception and the franchise saw multiple releases on different home consolesthis is one of those titles that saw a release on both the super nintendo and the sega genesis
however unlike most games that saw a release on both systems the two games are vastly different
also rare about this plight is that the sega genesis title is also widely considered to be very much superior to the super nintendo version
an bit nes release also came out but by then nintendo was obsolete
i would venture to say that the nintendo release by ocean games same as the super nintendo is an attempt to be a harshly watered down version of the super nintendo release
however it is extremely ugly and confusing and not at all fun to playthe super nintendo version of the game is an extremely long and complex adventure from an overhead view where gamers take the role of dr alan grant
you search all over the island for dinosaur eggs and must also navigate some very confusing firstperson shooter type corridors inside buildings to locate batteries for the night vision goggles as well as id cards to give you further access
dr grant must also find computers to communicate with the shipyou know what screw it
the game is notoriously long confusing difficult and not worth finishing and lots of people hate itnow the sega genesis game is a much simpler approach to what gamers want in a jurassic park game
it is an action platformer where dr alan grant must navigate his way through jurassic park by shooting dinosaurs ultimately resulting in a daring escape from the islandwas that so hard
this is what kids wanted in a jurassic park game
i feel like what ocean tried with the super nintendo release was very ambitious and just kind of a concept ahead of its time
with young gamers all that was needed was a solid action platformer and the sega genesis deliveredi always enjoyed the opening sequence of the game
it starts off with dr alan grants land rover breaking down during the storm in front of the trex pen of the dinosaur tour
the view shows the trex peering into the windshield of the car and you can see grants eyes widen in terror then it shows the trex mauling the car in his massive jaws as the music thumps horrificly and the darkness strobes
you then start off the game as grant lost somewhere in the junglegrant is an allaround action man
he can run jump throw grenades shoot his weapons climb and handoverhand from vines
you encounter charging triceratops spitting dilophosaurus obstructive brachiosaurus pestering compys vicious raptors and of course the bloodthirsty trex
grant will fight his way through the jungle survive the brutal power station navigate the lethal jungle river ride my personal favorite figure out the puzzling pump station blaze through the canyon and the scorching volcano and then finally overcome the juggernaut that is the visitors center
and it wont be easygrant runs around collecting weapons to use to fight his way through the horde of dinosaurs
some of the jumps require platforming mastery and there is alot about the game that is trial and error
my favorite level which is the river level requires you to navigate many waterfalls which may or may not lead to safe passage or doom
all the while you have to collect gas cans to keep the boat adequetely fueled
running out of fuel renders you helpless to the current of the river and unable to navigate the waterfallsthe level designs and animations are pretty well done
all the dinosaurs look about as good as they are and are pretty representative of how they were portrayed in the movie
although the genesis does have its graphical limitations jurassic park even went above and beyond with the trex which has a remarkable graphical representation
although you will never see anything but the trexs head and neck the appearance is stunning and looks great and even was able to inspire some fear in old school gamers
even the trex roar sounds incredible and intimidating
dont get too close or you will be instantly devouredi should also note that there is a second game included on the cartridge that allows players to play as the velociraptor in search for a tasty meal known as dr alan grant
to do that you go through many of the same levels slaying other dinosaurs and numerous wellarmed jurassic park guards to reach the end of each level
to be blunt the controls for the raptor are significantly much stiffer than that of dr grants and the game is much shorter and less funthe music is mediocre and the sound effects are also mediocre
i would say that the graphics particularly the trex are above average but the game is severely hampered by framerate problems
in short the game tends to slow down whenever there are either too many dinosaurs on the screen or the trex appears which is brutally annoying
the level design i would definitely call above average particularly the river boat level which is just an excellent treat on the eyes due to the smooth animation and definitely the mind due to the high level of challenege
even if you die many times attempting this level you will still find yourself persevering to figure out the waterfall solutions and solving the level
it is quite fun i assure youso in the end we see that this game while it certainly isnt the greatest bit achievement definitely deserves substantial recognition because it is an above average action platformer that bears the name jurassic park
how unfortunate that ocean attempted to get maybe a little too creative in the super nintendo attempt
while it isnt a bad game too many flaws such as an absurd littany of tasks with no password or save feature really cripple this game
all gamers wanted at this point was a solid action platformer where you fought dinosaurs and thus the genesis version of the game is really the only version that delivered especially when you consider the sega cds illogical and putrid effort at making a jurassic park game
some graphical and audible flaws put a damper on the experience but this is still a solid game with some substantial fun to be had
also this is one of the better entries in the genesis library as well
life finds a wayinfinitely worse than its sequel vectorman i nevertheless boasts clean colorful graphics a killer soundtrack originality lightningquick action and of course one of the greatest characters ever  vectorman those who played vectorman ii first will be surprised to find out that he has a different voice
part action game part shooter vectorman manages the various variables that make a game fun to play very well
the levels themselves are very different  from bamboo mills to sinister spaceports to icefilled underwater caves vectorman has it all
in between the levels there are shooterstyle boss battles  each very different from the rest
on one occasion you are a cricket on an unrolling mat shooting at two giant fists trying to squash you
in a few levels you find yourself in a disco setting shooting at a spinning electric monstrosity
with the help of items vectorman can transform himself into a number of things  a drill to a rocket to a dune buggy still the sequel has more optionsi find the levels to be absolutely beautiful
the science fiction setting really works wonders for the game
try it
you wont be sorryfirst let me say that im a year old gamer who doesnt care for ultra violence and gore and no longer has the reflexes necessary for the quotactionquot games
ive been playing computer games since the original zork walk south  open door keep that in mind as you read on i agree with many of the other reviewers that there was a lot of talking in this game although you can zap through much of it and there are times when everything is so slow like in that ampamp library
also i am completely opposed to the kind of foul language used in the game
no one would have noticed its absence but its presence was a big minushowever even given those flaws this was a compelling interesting and entertaining game
the puzzles were for the most part logical  the storyline was excellent  the characterizations wonderful
i enjoy games where characters interact rather than exploring alone a la myst
and i loved the ending
i truly didnt want it to stopperfect
no
but very very goodthe setting a rd century chicago type city
you are april ryan a young struggling artist in a little bohemian township known as quotvenicequot
the game starts with you having a nightmare a sort of prophetic dream
then you get out of bed and begin your day not realizing that eventually you will begin a series of events and discover things and people who lead you to believe that you are a quotsaviorquot for two worlds that have been split in halfyour own world and another world of magic
for over  years these worlds have been kept apart and now its up to you to keep them that way
you april ryan travel as a quotshifterquot between the two worlds meeting and greeting different people and creatures and have many separate adventures
some adventures include puzzleshard but always intriguingthey rival that of myst
the graphics are like no other game and the characters are intense and unforgettable
its been two months since ive played the game but i still pine for it every day
i find myself missing april ryan and her friends
sounds silly but to get through the game you have to ask lots of questions to each new face  i say quotfacequot because well not eveybody is human and over time you feel as if you know them intimately
i  only gave this game  stars because once youve completed the journey you feel a great loss
it has to end sometime
the replay factor is questionable
you could replay it just for fun over and over i surely did but the path will always be the same and you will have to ask all those questions over and over
i sold my version after i played it nonstop for weeks
i am seriously thinking of buying it again
really im not kiddingif endless running shooting battling running shooting battling is not your thing then i highly recommend you take this journey with april ryan
great scenery not so very complicated puzzles and a nice ending make for lovely adventureas a veteran of puzzleoriented games i find they fall into two categories generally heavy on plot or heavy on intellectual puzzlesolving
quotjourneyquot is of the former type
i love the fact that there is a very welldeveloped plot and there are very welldeveloped characters but the solutions to puzzles are dropped in your lap most of the time between the protagonists conversations and her journal
a couple of times they werent obvious and then they were nearly impossible to come up withthat being said my husband and i are having a wonderful time playing this game
as a woman i can say that having a female protagonist for a change is a great thing although i do wish some of the women would be in non skintight clothes occaisionally but im not about to tell the gaming industry who their primary audience is
the graphics are lovely except that for some reason the wellrendered characters with fairly realistic movement are completely incapable of interacting realistic with any of the objects
we dont know whats up with thatmy only other small nitpick is the language
for myself i find it very entertainingrefreshing but i was thinking that having a toggle would be nice
i would have loved to share this game with my preteen cousins because the storytelling way of leading you through the puzzles would be very good for younger players
however if i gave this to them my uncle would never speak to me again im surei would definitely recommend this game particularly if you want something that tells a story and whose puzzles arent in the same league as say the myst familythe longest journey is a pretty unique rpg  it gives you the role of a teenage girl who lives in the future
you move through her world dealing with her landlady her classmates her boss her friends and many otherslike other rpgs you have to find items solve puzzles remember clues from conversations and in the end save the world
as a base rpg its pretty fun with good graphics and gameplayif you love dialogue a la planescape torment then youll enjoy this
there is gobs of dialogue
everyone you meet has lots of things to say and they go on and on
be sure to have lots of snacks and drinks nearby because you could be there for a while clicking to learn moreon the downside this can get tedious at times and there are times when something is obviously sitting in front of  a persons nose but they wont do anything until you ask just the right combination of questionsi was also disappointed by the immature quotgirlyquot attitude of the heroine
i was hoping this would be a realistic young woman that would help encourage people playing to respect her
instead shes ditzy has the quotickquot reaction to a lot of things and is downright snotty at times
while this may be the stereotype of women of this age it is hardly the realitystill the game definitely has a personality and the characters and plot are well thought out
this might be a game that gets girls into playing who might not be interested in playing other games  and it starts to encourage other game developers to work on this style of game
we can only hope that at some point in the future theyll have a game with a female lead character that doesnt involve torpedoshaped breasts or unpleasant characteristicsplot player searches two worlds postapocalyptic earth and an alternate universe with magic for parts of a magical device that will keep the two earths in balancebrain vs reflexes brains  reflexes optimal age level  due to huge amounts of profanity and the strongly teenoriented story plus a back story of a teen running away from a semiabusive familydifficulty averagehardaverage time expenditure average  dayswhen this game first came out i played it once shrugged and gave it away
six months later i still couldnt get it out of my head and had to buy it again
the characters are realistic and gripping the graphics are gorgeous the interactions natural well  mostly and the puzzles just hard enough
and no stupid chess problems either
acting and writing are excellent
lots and lots of human interaction no violence or timelimited puzzles
just the way i like itas a long time adventure addict it was a real pleasure to find a new adventure story
the tale tells of april ryan an  year old woman who runs away from home to become an art student
the longest journey is both a lovingly depicted tale told with a great deal of verve and imagination and the symbolic telling of a young womans coming of agei found much to love about the game
not only april but many of the lesser characters are well developed showing a depth far beyond the typical computer adventure game
characters like crow and cortez have a real sparkle
the two worlds are extremely detailed in a style reminiscent of jack vance or roger zelaznythe puzzles are almost all solvable by reasonable experimentation
its a relief to find a game where you do not also have to by the guide
on the whole this is a very fine effortseveral things keep me from giving it five stars though
the action is a little to slow for modern tastes
there is a great deal of dialogue and it is a bit too didactic for me
finally several of the characters use very strong language  hence the games rating for mature  players
had the language been softened a bit the longest journey would have been a superb experience for any child or adulton the whole though this is a complete winner
very rarely does a game come to market this well craftedthere must be a good reason why the original game which was extremely popular in norway was made into serveral languages
the obvious reason that is is the greatest unlike most adventure games this isnt a quot myst clonequot type
instead it is the traditional quot point and click quot adventure gameyou play april ryan an  yearold smart mouth art student
she discovers that she is a shifter able to quotshiftquot between two graphically beautifully designed world of stark  a world of technology and logic  and arcadia  a world of fantasy and magic 
along the way you will meet an array of interesting characters and solve many clever puzzlesthis is a game with a fantastic storyline that is well integrated into the game not like most games that are made todaythe original music score the funny conversations and the excellent voice acting makes this one game worth playing and waiting forone major set back is the long and sometimes boring conversations you will have with the characters
but each conversation that you make will be recorded which is quite useful
overall this game is not suitable for anyone who few offended by foul language but it is definately and should be the best game of the year
why not try the demothe longest journey is an amazing game in more than one way
first of all its storyline is nothing short of epic
changing from the middle ages to the future or a fantasysurrounding from innercity squares to outlandish dockyards it is sure a long journey
the makers have put a lot of thought in writing this script and it shows
its story is compelling and original
the graphics are quite beautiful i would say you cant get them much better
and heroine april ryan makes for a nice change in action hero  shes charming and fresh
so far the strong points
there are some weaker points too
navigation within the screen is somewhat slow and cumbersome
this can get worse if your computer is not the very latest
tlj is very choosy when it comes to computerconfiguration
with an up to date d and soundcard and its latest drivers it should be no problem however
as the story evolves so doe the inventory of things you pick up on the way
it can be quite confusing what item to use and for what purpose
the actions youre suppose to perform can be farfetched or downright stupid to say the least  imagine buying a can of coke having to put it in a paintshaker so that later on it will explode in someones face i suppose tlj biggest drawback is the enormous amount of dialogue which you cannot skip properly
you have to sit back and listen to long very very long dialogues some just for fun or so
it can be very tedious and a test for your patience
theres quite a lot of unneccesary swearing too
having said that i would surely recommend tlj for its an original and beautiful game  april ryan will surely enter the gallery of great videogame characters  even if the voiceacting is in fact below standardi really liked this game and couldnt wait to get back to it every night
it really did offer the extended gameplay advertised  it took me over a week to get through it whereas most games only last a couple days despite purporting a zillion hours of play
the voice acting was phenomenal  probably the best ive ever come across  the scenery was lovely the story well thoughtout
i particularly liked the use of philosophy especially the bandus
this game served up a number of lifetruths along with its puzzles and settingsthe puzzles themselves range from very simple to quite complex
a few were annoying in that their solutions involved pixelhunting which sometimes led to a hint page just to be sure there was really something to hunt for
a few others could not be solved unless you had had a particular piece of a particular conversation even if you otherwise knew the answer
i found this frustrating as i several times had to go visit every character to determine what piece i was missing
too there were  a few places where i expected a puzzle of some kind but found instead that clicking on the object in question simply solved it for youthe interface suffered from some inconsistencies
it would have been helpful if the quoteyequot icon always switched to a quotdaggerquot icon when you could interact with something and if the quotdaggerquot icon always meant something could happen not just that april would make a commentocassionally the extended dialog got to be a bit much especially when the charactersprogrammers found it necessary to repeat certain information ad nauseam as in the maerum section or spell out answers that you sould easily get on your ownif you are easily annoyed by running back and forth hunting inventory items andor bits of information you will probably not like this game much
on the other hand if you are willing to be involved in the characters and their story quotthe longest journeyquot will give you a lot of enjoymentbe sure to check out the quotbook of sercetsquoteverybody knows that this is a good game if you can get past the awkward control scheme
what people dont seem to know is that the controls are vastly improved in the n port of megaman legends aka megaman  you will have a better time with this port than the ps classic version
that said the game is a little short and the graphics while still better than the original are quite dated so if youre used to psxbox  graphics it will practically look archaic
i had a genuinely good time playing this game and id be happy to recommend it to others
megaman  proves that a unique entry for a franchise doesnt at all mean a bad oneif you want a d megaman experience this is not it there are multiple scripted d cutscenes that are all in my opinion very well executed
this game can be challenging but the hardcore elite will probably want to stick with the classic and x series megaman gamesmega man  is a fully enhanced port of the original playstation hit mega man legends
the game still remains the same thing as its psx counterpart
but unlike the its psx predecessor mega man  has better and smoother graphics tight controls and nonstop d action
mega man  definently showed that it can improve over its psx cousin with the new enhancements mostly thanks to the power of the nintendo  since there was no rumble feature on the psx version there is a rumble feature in this version
everything about the game is excellent
the only thing that bothers me is the occasional framerate errors and glitches weak voice acting and flat looking buildings floors and walls
even if this game came in the right place at the wrong time mega man  is still worth the purchase to those who never played the psx version
if you played the game already you would easily beat the game without breaking a sweat and quickly return it to the store
if you havent played the game youll enjoy playing this game hundreds and hundreds of times
i love this game and i suggest that all mega man fans who dont own a playstation should get this game
now the two rival systems nintendo  and playstation are now even
they both got the same title
still it shouldve came out  years ago
even if this is just a port of a  year old playstation game youll still enjoy it anyway
and believe me this game is not mimicing the playstation version
improving the graphics and the gameplay is not mimicing
anyway if you wanted to play a better game for the nintendo  with more action stunning d graphics and tight gameplay mega man  is your game i wish this game would take itself a little more seriously
it is a little toony
but fun and challenging and that is what countsto me what is appealing about this game is that there are enough choices to make the play fun
classic super mario looks great and plays a little better than the original and playing the other classics with enhanced graphics is a lot of fun
the only downside to this game is the lost levels selection
this particular part of this game is one of the all time hardest most difficult play in nintendo history which is ok if you are an experienced gamer and desire the challenge
but if you are just looking for fun dont even think of trying this selection
just stick to the other mario adventures and youll be fine
i will never forget how challenging those levels were
i remember crying because they were so hard
this game is definitely one of the better ideas in nintendo history
putting all three mario titles on one cartridge was genius on the part of nintendo
definitely worth havingi really enjoy this  in  game it has all of the nes classics and its really fun plus once you get bored or frustrated with one of the games on there you can switch to another one on the same cartridge
my only very slight dissappointment is that it is a mario game for super nintendo and it does not have super mario world on therethat blows my mindhahahaanyway it is worth having in a collection if you still really enjoy snes games
i would definitely recommend this to anyonei used to love this game when i was a little kid
its cool because it is actually  games on one cartridge
super mario bros mario bros  mario bros  and lost levels
the best mario is still super marioworld thoughsold on a separate cartridge
there isnt much else to say except these were the good mario games before they came out with the lessthanexceptional n oneswhen it comes to fun these old mario games never get old so to speakeven though my kids have a playstation and wii they still love all of the old mario games and super mario all stars is one of their favoritessuper mario allstars
a revamped collection of the first three super mario nes games plus a mario game that was never released in the us until nowjust this past summer i finally bought a snes and started collecting all sorts of games for it
i guess you could say that i was more of a sega genesis gamer back in the bit era but since then ive seen that both systems bear their own strengths and redeeming qualities
one of the games that should be bought first for the snes is super mario allstars a greatest hits collection of the nes mario games with revamped graphics and sound
how does it fare
lets seepositiveslike i said before there are  games with around  levels combined which makes this game a bargain of a deal
thats a lot of play time for anyone who wants itnow you have the ability to save each game at each world
to those who normally have a hard time with mario games this feature helps gamers get accomodated with each of the different gamesthe graphics have been revamped to look spectacular
now there are scrolling backgrounds and all the characters and enemies look better than evereven with the revamped look every aspect of each game remains intact from the levels to the placement of coins and enemies
the difficulty is also the samelost levels originally the japanese smb is a welcome addition and proves to be a great harder extention of the original smb gamenegativesalthough the graphics upgrade is nice the new sound and music here are plain bad
the snes has much better examples of great music quality and the music here just sounds bland
not downright horrible but compared to the nes original music its quite a letdown
as a paul melin stated the sound effects are also quite dumbed downby including the save system some of the challenge factor is lost in the gamesi agree i would have rather had the nes originals compiled here as opposed to the newer versions
there were some unneccesary additions to some of the games such as the background bonus icon in the underground parts of the first gameas it was stated elsewhere if you already own and beaten each of the first three mario nes games there is very little else new that you will find other than the lost levels gamethe bottom lineif youve never played the first three mario games and you only have a snes make every effort to hunt down this great collection
its got a few flaws but otherwise it works well
they offer plenty of playtime to the average gamer and it makes for an excellent addition to any snes library
highly recommendedback in the day way before roms and emulators and the internet there were limited platforms on which to play and with snes eclipsing the original nintendo people didnt want to lose classic nes games
nintendo had this great idea where they bound up the three original nes mario games  smb   and   and put them on the super nintendo in one cool cartridge so you really got three games in one
this set also featured an extra game lost levels so this is four games in one and was a neat treat for nintendo to give its fans plus this cartridge also came with a save feature so you could fully explore all the games to your hearts contenti was always a fan of the  original super mario bros games for the nintendo and with all stars you get all three on one cartridge plus one more the lost levels the sequel to the original game which was released in japan originallyit seems that there are some updated graphics and while that does not bother me i can understand how those who crave genuineness might be disappointed
also while there were certain glitches and tricks that players were able to utilize in the original games  world  in smb  they have been eradicated from this versionone of the great aspects of this game was the introduction of the lost levels a new game for the alreadyfan of mario
this game was originally not released worldwide because it was thought to be too difficult and indeed some people will find this game more difficult than the original nintento games hint luigi jumps further and becomes necessary to pass some levels but it has many of the same elements we came to know and love of mario and a few morethis game allows me to play the games i love and an extra on my snes i currently do not know where my nes is and is certainly a fun blast from the pastwas not as fun as i remember as a kid   but like that it has all  mario bros and a little extra
donot like that it changed the first mario brosthe first super mario brothers game is what made me buy thissecond super mario brothers  is a good game its just like the first gameps if you are a snes fan than get thiscartridge has yellowing and has nicks on top of cartridge
had to clean a couple times to get it to work
arrived quickly and ultimately does workjust slightly underwhelmed is allwhile i still prefer the original bit versions mario all stars is next best thing
it includes  of the nes mario games one of them never released in the us up until this point plus the games are enhanced with bit graphics and sound and save features
the graphics do take away nostalgia and are occasionally rough but for the most part are a welcome change
i wish they had kept the original tracks instead of updating them the new instruments sound cheap and obnoxious
the save feature is the biggest improvement
no longer will cutting off the game start you over as it can now save what world you are on and what level in lost levels
having all four games on one cartridge is highly convenient also
it is worth the money since your technically getting four games that normally cost a fortune for the original versionsthe idea behind super mario all stars for the super nintendo is a great one
put together all the mario games at least to that point on a single cartridge and allow players to save their progress
wow
while the concept it a great one the trouble ive always found with this collection comes from the individual games themselvesmario   percent of my time playing all stars was spent playing this game as it is the one that easily translates the best from nes to snes
it is the only game that doesnt feel like a port and it is the best allaround mario game maybe ever mario  may give it a runmario  a faithful recreation of the iconic original
however ive always felt that game was meant to be played on the original nes with the twobutton control
it plays okay on the snes but it loses some of that atmospheremario  this is just a strange game to begin with
it is completely different pulling up plants and throwing them
than any other mario game
i know some people really enjoy it by i always skipped this one because i thought it wasnt as good as the traditional mario setuplost levels the trouble here is that lost levels is just too doggone difficult the reason why the strange mario  exists in the first place as game distributors correctly evaluated it as much too hard for us gamers
it looks great and feels like a classic mario game but good luck getting anywhere past the first couple of levels
i can run through the entire mario bros original with almost no damage but i could barely even make a dent in this onethus your overall enjoyment of super mario all stars will likely come down to two factors  does it bother you to play a game on a different system for which it was intended and  will you play mario  andor lost levels enough to even make it worth your while
i had hours of fun playing mario  from this cartridge but all the others pretty much sat stagnant for the reasons described abovegreat pedal that work perfectly with my feet and flight sim
only downside is it slips a bit on the floor
but not that often
could be hour i am positioned
otherwise i think its the better choice over the saiteki have a new gateway  ghz computer with  mb of ram and my older flightstick pro was reluctant to work with the new machine although it and the pro pedals both worked fine on the old amd k with janes wwii fighters and other gamesso i ordered a new pair of ch pro rudder pedals for usb port connectors
also a new flightstick pro usb
the flightstick immediately worked fine but janes wwii fighters does not support the usb rudder pedals
unfortunate because in my opinion janes is the best simulator game around
microsofts  combat flight simulator  works fine with the usb devices but you must go into settings after the game is running and set the assignments for the rudder pedals
first remove all the assignments that may be currently assigned to the rudder pedals typically ailerons and elevators x and y axes and scroll down to  rudder function and change assignment until it shows the z axis slider
the throttle will also show the z axis
dont worry about the apparent duplication
both are sliders and both will workin a nutshell the rudders work except for the toe brakes
so far there is no application game that supports chs toe brake on the market but they assure us that some will come along in the near futurei like chs products perhaps because ive used them for years
i like the sliding function of the rudder pedals which simulate an airplanes pedals very well
its just too bad that they are ahead of the market with a product that doesnt work on the older games
a solution looking for a problemjoseph h pierreauthor of the road to damascus and other bookswhats there to say
this network adaptermodem just pops into the back of your ps then you spend about  or  minutes fiddling with the very easytouse setup disc
assuming everything went well you can test it out by playing one of the two included demos madden  or frequencyi liked that it was easy to install and configure and i like the way it looks sticking out of the back of the ps
i do wish that the console had come with a network adapter in the first place especially since everyone is having such a hard time finding this item now
at least they give you a coupon for a free copy of twisted metal black online that made shelling out for this a little less painfulthis is definitely a good buy and there are a lot of great online games coming out in the next few monthsa few words of advice rather than paying as much as twice the cost of the network adapter to get one from a private seller just wait
by the time sony is keeping up with the demand therell be a lot more games out
if you really cant live without online play a few online playstation games for instance tony hawk  and madden will work with a usb network adapter
also be sure to pick up a usb keyboard so that you can chat with your online friends and rivalsthe network adapter is a must have
if you are worried how much it cost its free
no subsciptions
you only pay for some games like ffx online
by the sony na because most other na dont workjust need this so i could hook a hdd to my ps
western digitals dont work with it just let yall knowwhy because the hdd has  sets of jumpers so the ide wont plug in right because of the power jack
the two jacks on the adapter dont stretch that far i tried already trust me youll be almost breaking it trying
so try to getfind a hdd that has only sets of jumpers on it then it should fit fine
the network worked just fine on itof all the current ps online games not one charges you to play
there are talks that everquest may do this  but i dont think they will in the long run
xbox after the free ride charges you a monthly charge to play on xbox live
i love playing madden and socom on the ps but this is about it
the reason i gave  stars instead of  is the lack of ps online titles
so if you dont like playing sports or fps online then i would hold off until later about getting thisanother problem i have had is that sometimes i have trouble getting online with my adapter
the connection test shows that i am connected but i cant get on the game server
i call sony and they say call my cable company
i call my cable company and they say that they see my ps connected
who knows
i do think it is something to do with my cable modem though
just make sure your isp allows this kinda thing before you buy the network adapterupdate i found out what was wrong with the connection
i just needed a router because so i could get on my pc and my ps without confusing the connectionsive owned the ps network adapter for almost  years and i can honestly say that ive never had any major problems with it
installation requires nothing more than a little common sense but for those that lack it theres an instruction disc that makes installation almost impossible for you to screw it up
gameplay has been very smooth for me
of course youre going to have your occasional server issues and your typical freezing every now and then but thats to be expected no product is flawless
i have a broadband connection so if i play against someone with a slower connection things can drag a little bit
but for the most part my gaming experience with the ps network adapter has been problem free
id reccomend it to anyonebought this to install a hdd into the ps and install games to the hdd over a network
only certain drives will work with the ps and i think gb is the most space it will recognize
there should be a compatibility list out there somewhere
good if your ps games are on their last legs and you want to preserve a digital copy
ps games are dirt cheap and have been for a while so if you missed out on some great importsundiscovered gems hit up a used game store after you pick up one of these and a compatible hard drivethis only works in fat pss and it might be hard to find one that is still in working order pss are notorious for hardware failureswhile xbox live still has the best internet options sony releases their network adapter which delivers smooth but sometimes skippy gameplay
it was much easier to install and get running than xbox live and you dont have to pay a montly fee to have it sit in your expansion bay however when i was setting mine up it had some problems connecting to the net
i left it alone and tried it later and it worked
go figure
a great purchase for anyone craving online attentionnowdays ps game consoles have a built in ethernet
you wouldnt need this but since i am old school i ahve to have old stuff so i have an old ps that requires this adapor
and it works fine once you download and configure your ps for it but eevrything it goodsea dogs is a very underestimated game in my opinionto start with on the box it says an epic adventure at sea and it really is you get drawn into a very atmospheric sea warfare game where your reputation means everything and your ability to choose the right crew from strange and piratey characters makes all the difference  theres even a blind gunner if you want one dire but dirt cheapthere are loads of towns and ports you can sail to at anytime you want providing you have a ship capable of defending herself over the hazardous seas looming with piratesevery ship out of the  there are can be customised and fitted out with you own crew and selected cannons
you can then once purchased stroll around the deck at your discretion a must when in combat is standing on the deck and ordering your gunners to fireyou will find however after a few fights that half of your crew have been killed and that your rigging has more holes in it then your ship has port and cannon holes
and so in the even of a beating up you can either tell your men to fix it themselves providing you have a carpenter on board or take her to a ship yard to be repairedthe music is fab with a really atmospheric tune in the background whilst in any of the  odd ports
youll slowly get better ships and sell yours on
mine is a class   cannon beast
easy for picking off merchant ships i play as a pirate
and that brings about another feature
you can play as the english french spanish or pirate teams
its not as simple as an option mind you no you have to show the team you choose that your on their side i unfortunately blew one of them up by mistake and so im now a pirate and im lovin itthere is also the feature of realistic day times and really cool weather and the battles on a stormy sea really make you think youll fall overboard when you hit the crest of the very well designed wavesyou of course cant just go up to any port you like
each team holds its own and you can go to yours and ask for jobs to carry out and then you get paid if you accomplish it
but if you cant be bothered just blow em out of the sea or on the other hand bored the ship and steal the lootyes thats right you can also on top of all this plundering you can grapple a ship and then sword fight your way to victory
you fight as the captain and your hits count for crewmembers dieing so if youre outnumbered  to  dont expect to live very longif you have a true battleship which i havent yet afforded then you can attack forts and take them over for the country you support the loot is good because in a mission of the spanish we invaded a french port and even though my team were all wiped out my final order to fire the remnants of my guns won the battle and i got a fortune which bought me a new shipall in all if youre looking for a game that is totally nonlinear and you can do just about anything within the limits of you crew and ship youll love it and its well worth the money youll have to paygood gameyes the grammatical writing in this game is that bad
yes that is sadly typical of the writing
does that mean you shouldnt get this game
no
well if you were a fan of pirates anyway
if you are a buccaneer at heart this game is for you
the graphics are stunning the gameplay both realistic and fun the rpg elements great
most of all the piratical atmosphere is fantastic even though it is set in a fantasy world rather than the historical caribbeanive been up for pretty much four days straight playing this game  the last game to do that to me was civii
nuff saidps
oh for you couchpirates out there learn how to use your sails in this game
battle sails are no jokei bought this cable a few days ago i also bought final fantasys dvd and all i can say is that this is the only true way to really enjoy playstation  the colors look brighter there is so much more detail i mean i was truly amazed
now i can really say that the ps was worth buying
this is a must have for every gamer
my only complaint is that the product is probably not the best on the market inmediately after watching a little closer to gt i noticed that some of the colors were not perfectly aligned as they should be i could also notice that when watching final fantasys dvd on the subtitles you could see some kind of blur and that was because the alignment of the colors was not perfecthey
this vertical stand makes it easy and convenient to store your sony playstation two it makes it stand up which is unlike other video units and gives the playstation two a nice visual amongst your other electronic equipmenti have been using this product ever since i have my ps and it does not scratch my disks
this thing saves a lot of space if you have larger systems like xbox all in the same room especially if you have to squeeze a littlebut the downer about this product is that it is overpriced
i got mine assembled with my ps for free and now that i look at it it is way overpriced
a price of about  dollars is reasonable
so if you need space buy this stand
if you need money do not buy this standits a stand
it holds a ps in the vertical position
thats all it does
lets see
its made of some pretty sturdy plastic
ummm
its attractive
okay i tried really hard but i just couldnt come up with anything else to say about this umm standholderthingie
theres really just not that much to it
it keeps your ps from tipping over if you didnt have the forethought to stick it on a shelf between a couple of booksif you have fifteen bucks burning a hole in your pocket buy it
otherwise save you money and buy another gamei dont know what it is about the playstation  ps but it calls out to you to be put into the vertical position
it just looks better standing veritcal rather than horizontal
that extra overhang on the right side just looks kinda sloppy when sitting horizontally
but i had a problemmy television and consoles are all on a black steel wire shelves
when set on its side the ps was on unsteady ground on my shelves
then i saw that this stand was available
i decided to do some comparative shopping but there was really no contestthere are several stands available for the ps both horizontal and vertical
i havent the faintest idea what the point is to the horizontal one it neither adds to the visual appeal of the system nor the stability
i could be mistaken but i dont think there is a danger of knocking the ps over while its lying horizontally
the other vertical stands were all black and very cheap lookinginstallation is very simple
you just take it out of the box and slide the ps in the groove with the notched section in the back
the front of the stand should be flush with the inset part of the pss quotbottomquot side
after that turn the playstation logo on the drive tray a quarter turn clockwise and shes ready to goas for disc scratching i havent had a problem
i dont know how the ps quotloadsquot the discs once the door is closed
ive heard enough talk to where it seems like the ps may scratch them in either position
im not going to lose any sleep over iti have little experience with console racing games
ive only had my ps for a few months and this was one of the first games i bought
its a blast to play
maybe its because i dont have alot of experience with other race games but i didnt find the controls any harder to learn than any other game
if you start out slow and practice a little youll find yourself powersliding in no timethere are only five tracks but i found that progressing up through the difficulty levels is challenging enough to keep the game fun through several replays
the two player mode is also good for challenging friends over and over
the only trouble ive had is with the simulation mode
its almost too touchy for me and i have trouble keeping my touch light enough
too much gas in a turn and you lay it down way too easilythe graphics are beautiful
i find the riders eye view to be a little dizzying and prefer the behind the bike view
the replays are a real joy to watch and they allow you to save some of your favorites
you can watch yourself wheelie out of a power slide over and overone problem i have with the game is that there seem to be several rewards for meeting challenges but they are few and far between
it looks like there are a few more tracks to unlock but i havent been able to get any of them yet
i havent done much racing in the expert level yet howeverall in all this is a lot of fun
ive since bought cart fury which is fun in its own right but this is still my favorite of the two
i would recommend it to anyone who likes motorcycles and racing gamesi wasnt sure about this game and i blindly bought it not knowing if id really enjoy it
it turns out that it is a very good game
it only takes a couple races to get the controls down  and the graphics are excellent
if youre not one for braking you may want to go the other direction though
it features a good number of licensed bikes but you start out with them all right off the bat so it takes away the point of competing for new ones
this is the games only downfall
theres not enough to keep you goingi collect racing games so had to get this oneson wanted a copy so i get more of themsomeone once asked if the topscrolling flightsimshooter is dead
i suppose the answer to this is yesand no
true very few of these games are being made those that are made are good enough though rarely fantastic to keep the genre alive if only for a little while
i suppose they will go the way of drivein theaters with people missing them but with no one really going out of their way to keep them alivei like working designs
the attention they give to their projects rivals motion picture distributors their localizations often resembling quotdirectors cutsquot and quotspecial editionsquot of films
even if the game is a rather obscure little pet project sihlouette mirage or a grandscale epic lunar working designs always wants to give their games that little bit of special treatment
here in addition to the chromeglossy packaging we are treated to quottranslators notesquot outlining the silpheed history
it really gives you an appreciation for what went into developing the gameit is almost enough in fact to make you ignore the fact that on the whole silpheed is not a great game
the weapons are dull by comparison to any other game in the genre my alltime favorite is star soldier vanishing earth for n and the story is really rather boring its attempt at creating an epic politicalwar drama falls flat on its faceanyway as for the gameplay itself which is all these games really seem to offer anyway the graphics are first rate easily leaving all others in its dust
the game models are fantastic and amazingly detailed worthy of playstation  psone gradius fans need not worry about gritty pixelated textures and n star soldier fans need not worry about smoothedover washed out ones
there may a little bit of slowdown here and there but it is not enough to be frustrating or even annoying really it is normally during explosions which actually helps to give the game a more cinematic feel
the level designs are in league with star soldier the notes tell of how the backgrounds were originally prerendered streaming videos making you not feel as though you are simply moving a cursor over an eyecandyladen screen and the learning curve is just challenging enough to not be discouragingwhile this is ultimately not a fantastic game it should certainly not be ignored and is at least worth a rental
put simply if you are a fan of topscrollers it is a good buy
if you are not that big of a fan you could probably take or leave itany gamer with a functioning brain knows that great graphics alone do not make a good game
true enough but great graphics can have a dramatic impact on the overall experience and this applies more to the shooter genre than to many others
blowing up articulated enemy fighters in intricately detailed environments is just so much more satisfying than blowing up blocky little peons while flying past bland uninspired scenery that looks like it couldve been lifted from a dozen other games of the same type
the designers of silpheed the lost planet know this very well and have created an oldschool verticallyscrolling shooter of such visual intensity that its almost as much fun to watch as it is to play
enemies are welldesigned hybrids of alien life and human technology cg movies look marvelous the different stages boast tons of detail and a good amount of variety and the framerate and animation are smooth as silk with no significant slowdown or choppiness to be foundaesthetic appeal aside silpheed tlp is plenty solid
there is nothing revolutionary to be found here but why bother trying to reinvent the wheel
if the gameplay is there and its not too short too hard or too easy then chances are most shooter fans are going to be reasonably satisfied
no exception here
theres nothing intrinsically wrong with the game
that is unless you count having to go back to the beginning of the stage when you get killed and continue
dont worry too much about that though
unlike most other shooters your ship here can take some licks and not immediately blow up
ten direct hits and youre dead
theres one point in every stage where four of your energy blocks will be replenished and youll also have the opportunity to switch weapons
there are several to choose from and you can take two at a time but you cant access them all right away youll have to progress in the gamewithout a doubt the biggest flaw here is the distinct lack of superfluous goodies
there are no speed boosters no additional ships to choose from no screenclearing smart bombs no nothing
you can individually fire your left and right weapons but youll find dearth of purpose in doing that since you can use them both at the same time with impunity
ergo you can beat the game using only one button not including the directional pad of courseon the audio front the music is sufficient but not remarkable except perhaps for the boss fight music which conveys a suitably frantic feeling
same goes for the quotpilots logquot voice which precedes each stage
throughout the game youll hear transmissions from your fellow silpheed pilots but good luck deciphering them all
its certainly nice though to know that humanity has decided to send more than one person to fight the coming wave of annihilation for a change
you wont see your buddies and they have no impact on the game but its an admirable touch nonethelessif you want to see your name on the upper portion of the high score board youre gonna have to take some risks
the number of points you get for blowing up your adversaries increases as the physical distance between them and you diminishes
this system makes it quite tempting to indulge in all sorts of daredevil antics and foolhardy laughter in the face of death
you may find yourself running on a prayer screaming at your weapons to shoot faster and sweating bullets trying not to flinch as seemingly endless enemy fire zeroes in on you particularly while fighting big bad nasty bosses
these are the moments that shooter fans live for and silpheed certainly has its share of themthis is the first oldschool shooter new to the ps konamis gradius collection doesnt count and despite its shortage of innovation it sets the bar at a pretty good height
but i dont think its unrealistic to expect future shooters for the system to surpass silpheed tlpi was shocked to see a us release of incredible crisis because the game is just so strange and chock full of japanese humor
its hardly the type of game someone who has been raised on a steady diet of cutesy mascotdriven platformers would understand much less embracebut theres a lot to like about ic which is a series of minigames that range from fingernumbing button mashers to memory and timing tests
the gameplay can be challenging at times but there are enough slapstick gags and pop culture references to keep you from getting madthankfully titus had the guts to localize ic virtually in tact japanese ska soundtrack and allprobably the most bizarre and memorable game to hit a consolein a while incredible crisis unleashes its fury uponamericasince most of the games are unique in their own rightsthis adds up to lots of replay value even if nothing is different thesecond time you play it
what other game lets you shoot down a giantstuffed teddy bear destroying tokyo in a jet fighter
who else letsyou race down busy highways on a stretcher
none i tell yawhilemost of the games are good fun some of them are repetitive
whoreally needs to play titanic away  times in order to play through thegame only once
not only that but  games that were in the japaneseversion were taken out of the american release
one of them was youhad to diffuse a bomb in a subway train as the final game for chapterone the other was a karaoke game actually thats one i couldve donewithout that appears right after the bear comes to life in chapterstill these are minor complaints
im sure if you spend themoney to get it you wont be disappointedquotincredible crisisquot strikes me as being more like a book or a movie than the typical game
most games youll play until youve mastered the skillset and achieved all the internal goals like unlocking characters or seeing different endings or until you grow bored with themquotincredible crisisquot is more like a crazy movie so inventive that youre enchanted with the question of quotwhat happens nextquotthe story involves a japanese family trying to get home early for grandmas birthday
along the way theyll face construction accidents explosions terrorists aliens etc in situations so bizarrely contrived they have to be seen to be believedits not really about the gameplay  the dozens of minigames are simple affairs sometimes consisting of just pushing the buttons really really fast
the simplicity is a good idea here since the appeal is the crazy story not the gameplay
it would be bad narrative if you had to play a minigame  or  times to get past itthe upbeat soundtrack by the quottokyo ska paradise orchestraquot nicely compliments the delightfully whacked storythe game has a very japanese flavor and you have to be openminded and willing to be won over to enjoy it
put another way if you like watching quotiron chefquot on tvs food network either for camp value or in sincere awe youll probably like incredible crisis
on the other hand if the last two games you played had the words quottwisted metalquot or quottomb raiderquot in their titles then you are probably waaaay too mainstream to get into this onei have a buddy who loved this game way back in the day and i wanted to try it
at first i was a little apprehensive buying a copy since if you look on the lowerright of the cover art youll see the titus logo best known as the company responsible for superman  an absolute gaming atrocity
thankfully this game is by far their best work being a blend of warioware and slapstick comedy with some great ska music for added comedic effectdancing quizzing and massaging are just three of the things youll be doing in this mishmash of lunacy and fun
honestly you just have to experience it if you want an excuse to dust off the old psi picked this one up at a rental store and im very glad i did
this game is very funny nice graphics and cool music
the down fall of this is most certainly the degree of patients this requires
i tell you some of those games had me wanted to send the playstation out the window but yet thats half the funbasicly you play differnt family members of an old man in which you must return home early for his special day
you then go through silly games like parapa the rapper the actual hitting the buttons at the right time and running from a ball like on indiana jonesi give the game  stars for its music and humor but not five stars only because the game is brutally hard and i still havent found out how to savethis game is the definition of a button masherit is hard
but if you stick with it you will berewarded
it is very unique and quirky and at abargain bin price you cant pass it up
good gameall things considered msu is a pretty great game
the greatness lies in its simplicity
while diddy kong racing was a fantastic game it was a little quotbusyquot for the gamer who just wanted to race
the track design while not wildly original is excellent
tracks are suitably short i hate overly long tracksand fit the spirit of the game perfectly
the weapon system is the best since the original super mario kart on snes actually requiring strategy and not merely luck
theress plenty of value here
lots of tracks a very good battle mode good multiplayers racing
also this game is probably the best use of the disney liscense so far
if you love disney charcters buy this game
the voices are perfect the animation is great rare really captured the spirit of each character
when you earn the taunt cheat youll love shouting out in cartoonspeak at will
the graphics are smooth especially in widescreen mode
the sense of speed in the pro level is very good
i think most gamers will really enjoy this game
its nonviolent fun but ultimately requires great skill youll need to learn the art of the perfect powerslideto master
as a multiplayer game it comes out ahead of diddy kong with mario kart  as a distant third
single player i still think diddy is the top of the crop with mickey in second
of course no one has yet matched the utter greatness of the original snes classic super mario kart
this does come close thoughthe bright sideyou can get better crystalclear picture quality
after using svideo for several years and the going to component youll instantly notice colors on the tv you have never seen before
its not easy to put in words but if you are ever in an electronics store look for a demo comparing composite to svideo to component and youll be amazed
paying the extra money to go to component is definitely worth it when it comes to your dvdsthe dark sidewhen it comes to dvds this component output is incredible
when it comes to your ps games no noticable difference in my view
maybe there is or was but it didnt catch my attention like it did with the dvd pictureis it really necessary or worth the money to get monster cables
in my opinion the answer is no
i did a test with a rdparty component ps cableno difference whatsoever
it seems monster cable jacks up their prices with their unnecessary mumbojumbo features of how they were constructed with nitrogenplutonium and the golddiamondkryptonite ingredients im not being completely serious by the waybut hey cables are cables
i mean unless you have like thunderstorms hailstorms tornadoes andor massive electromagnetic fields generating in your living room yeah you may need these highquality invincible cables
but in my opinion theres no real need
so what if these quality cables last a life time
name a single person in this world who would keep a ps for so long in hisher lifemy advice is to just get the cheap cables
they are good enough
or look for the monster brand cheap like i did on ebay
seeing that component cables have three jacks ive noticed many people make the mistake believing audio is includednope
those three red blue and green plugs are for video only
go with component but not monster brandunnecessary high price knocks a star off of this one but they work just as well as the sony ones
luckily i got these for freethis is a really good quality cable and i do notice a better picture using it
the cable is a bit pricey thoughi ran this game in xp with compatibility for  activated and the ingame option for texture correction unchecked
once i followed these couple of simple steps the game looked great
you can actually see what some of the pictures are that adorn the walls of this terrorbeseiged city
one interesting thing about the pc version is that all costumes are unlocked from the beginning
that way you can go straight to jills special  costume without being a resident evil master
the other thing i noticed about the pc version is that enemies appear in places they didnt in the playstation version
i also got a new scenario with tyrell and nicolai that ive never seen before
overall the game looks great and plays fine
the  primary benefits over the playstation version are the improved graphics and the fact that all costumes are available from the beginning
however the graphical improvements do not apply to the item menu
that still looks fuzzy like it was ported directly from the psx
and just remember if you see weird lines across the background graphics toggle texture correction on or off
that fixed the problem for meresident evil  nemesis was a welcome addition to the hugely successful and apparently neverending re franchise unleashed in the later s
by using a simple but strong formula which combined the two genres of horror and action used third rather than first person perspective for the characters and dealt out liberal doses of gore while also challenging the player to use his head capcom literally created a monster
as proof of this i reference an argument i once in witnessed in a local bar between four or five grown men over whether the submachine gun magnum or mossberg gauge was most effective for oneshot stops of umbrellas failed science projects the zombiescapcom released nemesis a few years back to tideover the fans who were grumbling for the always coming but seemingly never arriving sequel to re  some were confused and thought nemesis was the sequel not realizing it is more of a companion volume its events take place more or less simultaneously with those of re  and in some of the same places
it is therefore not so much an advancement of the complex re storyline as an extended sidetrip but it is still well worth your time
i still break this bad boy out every blue moon on my trusty old pcnemesis opens in media res with excop heroine jill valentine running for her life amidst the burning ruins of downtown racoon city
as we all know the villainous umbrella corporation unleashed its deadly mutagenic virus in the city turning  of the city into flesheating zombies and the other  into a buffet
jills master plan is the same as every other re hero to get the hell out of dodge
unfortunately for her and you that is a lot harder than it sounds
the police have been basically wiped out and your only friends are the survivors of an umbrella specialops squad some of whom turn out to be the kind of pals you could really do withoutnemesis is similar to the other re games in that it combines the nowfamiliar themes of a finding various useful objects and weapons scattered around the city and putting them to use b fending off zombines and other disgusting lab projects brought to you courtesy of umbrella c solving puzzles which range from how freaking dumb do you think i am
to if i dont figure out this stupid water puzzle soon im gonna put my foot in the television
all amidst a lot of creepy music and spooky sound effects
the main difference is the presence of the nemesis a nasty piece of work who appears about a quarter of the way through the game and truly earns his nickname
hes yet another umbrella scifi project gone bad and his only purpose in life is to kill stars members which means you
hes reminiscent of the tyrant guys you fought in re  but virtually indestructible and much much faster
believe me when i tell you will hate this sob more than your landlord exgirlfriend and noisy neighbor combined
he could give persistence lessons to the terminatornemesis boasts a few gimmicks to spice up the action including a playable sidekick character from umbreallas mercenary army named carlos olivera and a choose your response function which allows the player to determine different outcomes to the game
since many of the outcomes are radically different from others its the sort of gimmick that makes you want to go back and play againnemesis isnt a perfect game
for one thing the speed of the inventory screen is agonizingly slow and the fonts which look very bad also roll out like theyre covered in molasses try holding down the space bar to make em move faster
the autoaiming feature theyve added since re  is more harmful than helpful since the computer has a nasty habit of autoaiming at targets which are a lot less threatening than the one standing right in front of you and the inability to save the game except at a few selected points can be pretty frustrating
and as in all the re games you spend way too much time running around over vast distances forgetting the lighter or that stupid lockpick can cost you boring minutes of running through screens youve already been through  times before
in some ways the playability of the game is actually lower than that of re  and ive also heard that the game will not save if you try to play it on anything more advanced than windows  be warnedall that aside its still a good game and you can buy it for your pc for practically peanuts
i used to play it at work all the time with the sound off thank god for privacy screens
call me a sick tool many have but theres something about blowing a zombies head off with a shotgun that just brings a smile to my face worms world party is a very entertaining strategy game for nearly any audience
both young players and mature ones will find some fun in this title
gameplay is simple and yet provides for many variations in strategy
games with other players can really be a great time as each teams worms try to blow up one another
the wormpot mode selection provides for a lot of interesting scenarios as well
there is a random map generator as well as a terrain editor so you will never play the same map twice
weapons are varied interesting and welldesigned
this is a very good game but not an excellent one
you should still find a lot of fun in it though so i would recommend to you as a worthwhile purchaseagain  im given the difficult task of reviewing a game of mixed renown
in the case of star wars unleashed it is safe to say it did well with its fan base selling millions of copies but was received with lukewarm scrutiny by the critics
because of this i did not know quite what to expect
having just beat the game all i can say is it delivered the goods i expected and was in no way a disappointment
like many other games that belong to the action platform genre it is a blast while playing but despite the fun you are having it  ends too abruptlyif there is a single crime force unleashed is guilty of it is that in some ways it is akin to playing god of war with a light saber
finishing off bosses or large foes requires button mash mini games
most are easy enough with the hardest one requiring the player to pull a star destroyer from the sky as tie fighters attack mercilessly
as you swathe your way through storm troopers rebels aliens and walkers you collect points from slain foes which eventually make you level up so you can improve force powers or buy brand new ones
there are many epic feats star killer can do and luckily enough a few special attacks such as lightning bomb are brand new to the franchisemost surprising is the story line is top notch
side characters such as the beautiful and resourceful imperial pilot eclipse and proxy the friendly yet psychotic droid are oddly endearing
the voice acting is delivered wonderfully as you would expect from a lucas arts title
in some ways the plot pulled me in just as much as the one in knights of the old republic though force unleashed should not be mistaken for an rpgthe only thing force unleashed can be faulted for is that you visit some worlds twice
felucia and kashyk come to mind immediately though im happy to say that the lay out drastically changes  for each visit
the environments can be truly breathtaking  and i was very impressed by the graphics as a wholein my whole time playing i can only think of one glitch
when i fought vader the second time our life bars froze
pretty much we were both invincible so i had to start my battle over with him upon resetting my   i was glad the same glitch did not happen twice
i should mention though the load times are slow the auto save points are put in good places so rest assured  dying does not require you restart the whole levelon account this is the ultimate sith edition you are also getting the jedi temple tattoine and hoth levels
two of these missions extend an alternate history in which star killer becomes the new darth vader
the jedi temple was exclusive to the ps version until nowhow worth while this game is depends on two factors
if youve already beaten force unleashed im hesitant to say if the  hours of extra content will be worth it for you
secondly be forewarned this is a star wars game from the action plat former mold thus you can likely beat it in one or two nights if you have nothing better to doif however you want to know how the rebellion got started and be put in the shoes of one of the most epic jedisith rear kickers of all time force unleashed ultimate sith edition is a steal at the present asking pricepros a plot of romance betrayal redemption and conspiracies delivered with flair and passion beautiful breathtaking visualsmostly fluid combat and varied ways of using force powersgame does not penalize you for failing real time event button combinations  on the lowest difficultysome of the best voice acting ive heard in awhileconsit is difficult to lock onto what you want sometimes to target objects or foes with your jedi abilitiesthe sound track is not bad per se but weve all heard these same tired musical scores thousands of times by nowthe game is not completely absent of glitchescan be beaten quickly if youve already beaten the original i cannot in good conscious suggest you trudge through the ultimate edition for a measly  additional hours of play on the special disc that includes the bonus levels
only the hoth mission is exclusive
the others can be purchased on xbox live as downloadable contentending thoughts it is hard for me to describe exactly how i feel about force unleashed ultimate sith edition
most complaints i could level at it would also have to be taken up with other games from the action genre
while it doesnt do anything new it does it very wellcertain people will have a beef with unleashed merely on account it uses the star wars license
many reviewers are prone to attack a title if it some how connects with a movie or popular franchise
force unleashed shamefully draws both those cardsyet i never witnessed an instance this game lied about what it was
for those of us that wanted a game similar to devil may cry or god of war with jedi sith and storm trooper it is a dream come true
had unleashed been an rpg i would have complained about its short span
however safe to say most of us know the appeal of this romp is throwing around hapless unfortunate souls with our minds right before we electrocute them with force lightning
on that raw visceral level unleashed succeeds while offering a memorable tale to bootusing your characters powers and lightsaber is fun
the gameplay is good and the animations are good and have variety
the controls are decent but they couldve used more fine tuning
the controls are easy to understand
you can upgrade your character which is essential for defeating certain boss fights
the graphics look good on a standard definition tv but they look better on a high definition tv
the difficulty could also use more balancing on medium difficulty its like playing on hard thanks to unresponsive controls although its not bad enough to become frustratingthe extra content is good if youre a fan of the star wars franchise or of action games
otherwise its not worth the price of this ultimate sith edition
its a good enough game to play through at least oncei dont have xbox live so i bought this even though i already had the original game
sith edition comes with  additional levels that are a must have for the star wars fanatic like me
jedi temple hoth and tatooine levels
tatooine level is the most fun of the   you get to battle boba fett meet jabba and fight more jawas
hoth is a little buggy with the game play but still fun too
may the force be with youthis is a great game in my opinion and i to traded in my older copy towards this new edition
so to keep things short which the  new bonus missions on the second disc quite literally are this is still a very fun game to go back and revisit if you havent played it in a while
i really like the metal collectors tin that it comes in as well
the one thing that i am really disapointed with is why couldnt they have incorporated the duel mode that was included exclusively with the wii edition
i think that they should have given us xbox users out there an updated and improved duel mode with this new ultimate sith edition
other than that this is still a very cool gamethe game controls very wellthe story is pretty good
im no star wars omega geek but i understood enough of it  how it related to the other moviesthe bosses were kind of tough
so yes enjoyable to fightthe goons were ok tooi really enjoyed leveling up in the gamea very nice thing about the ultimate edition is you get all the dlc skins   dlc levels with on the second discsearching for the hidden cubes is always good fun
i found most but wow some i have no clue lolso this game has lots of replay value  unlockablesvery very funi love this game because im a star wars fani think all the expansion packs for this game could be better longeri really miss a multiplayer mode in this gamegoing onto the topic of graphics this game is visually stunning
buff effects are quite pretty and sunsets are just as beautiful as they are in real life
players look nice and realistic and a variety of clothing is available for mixing and matching outfits
i mean we need more but its still a fairly substantial amountif you want to roleplay this is probably a good choice
ive seen more roleplayers in this game than any other
the game is enjoyable and thats what mattersid advise you to download the trial
if you know someone who already plays have them help you get started
you may find its actually kinda fun
just play it for what it is and you may be pleasently surprisedat long last
one of the most anticipated fighting games of all time has finally arrived on our shores for the dreamcast
the worlds two biggest companies on the fighting circuit pit their baddest brawlers against each other in a noholdsbarred slugfest to see just whos the best
a lot of people have been waiting for this one to come out ever since capcom and snk announced late last year that they would be developing a game together and now its here in all its d glory
so was it worth the wait
does it live up to all the hype
wellmostly
overall this is one of the most solid fighting games out there
the control is pure capcom gold tight and responsive a little awkward for snk veterans but after a couple of games it fits just fine
four attack buttons instead of six means it even feels good on the standard dc controller
the gameplay is a little okay a lot different than your average fighting game
you build a team of fighters using a points system
see each fighter in the game has a rating of   or  and you get  points to play with meaning you can have anywhere from two to four fighters on your team
the strongest characters have a rating of  the weakest a 
not only that you have two different fighting styles grooves to choose from an quotsnkquot style which plays mostly like the king of fighters series or a quotcapcomquot style which plays more like the street fighter alpha series
needless to say strategy is this games most important aspect which is rare in a fighting game
the music is pretty much what youd expect some techno with guitar mixed in nothing really memorable but decent enough
theres a whole bunch of secret stuff to find in here too mostly quotexquot alternate versions of the original fighters extra costume colors and hidden stages but enough to keep you playing for a good while to unlock them all
and lastly the graphics
since this game was developed by capcom all of the snk characters were redesigned
they have a very quotcapcomquotish look to them some king of fighters fans may frown upon this but the new looks fit the game pretty well
the biggest disappointment though is the fact that with the exception of ryu ken and m bison all of the capcom characters look exactly like they did in the street fighter alpha series
when they stand across from the snk characters they look like they were just pasted in
capcom really cheaped out on that count especially when you consider how long it took for this game to come out
this flaw doesnt detract from the gameplay at all though which is the important thing
backgrounds are top notch and they all have a nice little quotintroquot sequence as well which is an snk trademark
some of the stages will even interact with the ongoing fight with toppling beams shadows and rustling leaves
when you put it all together youve definitely got one of  the standout fighting games of the year overall great graphics tight gameplay a unique battle system and even a decent replay value
fight fans rejoice the wait is over i really like this game in spite of its drawbacks hence the four stars
ive held battles against friends that have been as intense as any of the more polished and refined fighters i own and i own lots of fighters and have had just as much fun
the game itself feels almost like a throwback
the controls are tight but less so than say sfiii and game feels kind of slow in comparison to other recent fighters
the fights are much more downtoearth so to speak with no super jumps or overpowered super moves to speak of
even ryus shinkuhadoken looks like a slightly bigger version of his normal hadoken whereas even in alpha  it was a little more menacing than his normal attacks
fans of the over the top style of previous vs games like marvel vs capcom will find this game abysmally slow and boring by comparison
as for snk fans they fare a bit better in that this game more closely resembles kof than the more recent capcom games though its not the same feel by a long shot
also they get wonderfully good looking redrawn sprites whereas capcom just recycled the alpha sprites again
bison ryu ken and akuma got redrawn however and akuma in particular looks very very good
of course then we have the hidden characters like morrigan that look absolutely awful especially when compared to the new sprites
pit morrigan vs akuma to really see the difference
if you were to see a screenshot of such a fight youd probably assume morrigan was photoshopped on there from another game she looks so out of place
the fighting system itself is badly flawed in some areashonda yuri benimaru vice and blanka are all far too powerful for level  characters but its still oddly fun
 slots are available and the player chooses characters depending on how powerful they are
example player one chooses  weak characters blanka benimaru cammy and king and player  chooses one very powerful character akuma or maybe strungout iori
player  would have to defeat all  of player s characters but player s character is much more powerful
in theory this works fine
the reality of it though is that  weak characters will overpower  strong character each and every time
in pro this is fixed a bit in that the weak characters are now weaker and slower and the strong characters much stronger and a little faster but the disparity is still there
still pro gives you the option of assigning power levels if you dont like the current choiceslevel  dan here i come
despite some balance and speed issues the game is still fun
its almost like playing a newer street fighter ii turbo
none of the real looseness of the newer games but a kind of zen groove all its own that can be gotten into fairly easily
anyone whos ever made the transition from mvc to say guilty gear x can pull this off just fine
the problem is this game was designed from the ground up as a hardcore fighting fans fighter hence the builtin grading system very difficult secret unlocking system and sometimes obscure groove settings but many hardcore fighting fans will nitpick over the flaws a more casual gamer will overlook
speaking for myself i really like the game and find it addicting as but most real fighter aficionados i know dislike it for the exploitable gaps in the fighting system while the casual fighting fans have either never heard of it or have no real interest since they dont recall any snk fighters
this is a real niche game to be sure
if you have fond memories of street fighter  youll be able to get into this and will certaintly enjoy it
if youre a fighting game fan looking for something new and unique you should enjoy it
if youre a newcomer to the genre or if youre hell bent on only playing fighters with the highest quality craftsmanship you may be let down
i reccomend it with some reservations depeding on personal taste
if youre unsure a rental will clear everything upi quite enjoy this fighter but by trying to meld two different fighting styles capcom has had to make unfortuante compromises
indeed this game proves outright that despite outward appearances the snk and capcom fighters are really very differenthigh points of the game include the presentation and overall graphics
whoever said this is no better looking than sf alpha  never played this game
the backgrounds are highres and each is introduced with real pride and high production values
and many attacks take advantage of the dc in the highres light show the refined pyrotechnics and more
in addition most characters have been given increased animation frames and some restylings
mai of snk fame looks even better here than in the latest kof
and for a character that in real life would cause unending traffic accidents from turning heads thats saying somethinghowever there is a notable exception in that a few capcom characters use recycled sprites
chunli did not receive the freshening her snk counterpart mai did
in fact coming from the remodeled street fighter  chunli to this ancient sprite is very roughwhether this was done for costtime or nostalgia reasons is unknown
a mistake either waygameplay is engaging but actually a wee bit simplistic especiialy compared with the street fighter  series and kof evolution
snk fighters have lost several moves to bring them down to capcom power levels though it is great fun sending ryu into the ground with terry bogard or pounding rugal with chunli
it is true however that this is really street fighter versus fatal fury
just look at the cover
the game really could use at least additional characters from sf and last blade for instance and yes one character in cvsnk is coming from sfonly their worst one
a very unique and fun fighting game in sum
but it likely requires a predisposition to snk characters to appreciate ityou can not do any  hit airial combos because the screen does not pan up when you hit your opponent into the airthe graphics are very bad
it look like a snes game
dont wate your money on this you will be disoppointed as i was
i expected much better from a game with snk and streetfighter charactersi bought one of these as a gift for a buddyit was okay in their opinioni was glad it worked just fine for themeven better than code veronicas setting and story
on the dc the graphics are upgraded and such but are kind of wierd at times kind of surreal almostbe warned play this before code veronica or the less developed graphics will turn re into a jokei used to own this game many years ago however when it stopped working properly i was very discouraged
it is the second best game of the series
the delivery was ahead of its expected delivery date
i certainly look forward to doing business againhow does wasting zombies at the turn of every corner sound
pretty good to me
thats what you get when you purchase resident evil   for those who have played it on the playstation you know what this is all about
the dc has finally put out the game series to keep it competitive
you begin the game by playing as leon a rookie cop for the raccoon city pd or claire redfield depending on wich disk you put in
you and claire are split up
you must find and fight your way to the police station
once you are there the real adventure begins
solving puzzles and of course killing a bunch of zombies
i dont want to give all the details as to what you need to do or what you encounter
it would ruin the fun for you
the quottquot virus plays an important role in the whole situation
and dont forget pay attention to the clues and read all diaries and faxes that you find
they are very important
for those of you who have played code veronica on the dreamcast you will find some differences in this game
first the game play and control is the same
the disappointing things are the graphics are not as good as code veronica
dont get me wrong they are not bad just not as good
that is why only  stars
second the game difficulty i feel is much eaiser than code veronica
i finished the game in about  hours
it took me about  to  hours to complete code veronica
it was a very entertaining and scarey  hours though
the best part of this game is that it leads into code veronica and resident evil  very well
why was this not released first
anyway the bottom line is this if you liked code veronica or scarey games it is well worth the money
otherwise keep lookingthis playstation  version of super bustamove isnt really super in that it doesnt offer any upgrades compared to the previous versions on the ps and other older consolesthe main difference is that you get a new set of characters and the graphics is tweaked a bitbut not by much
if youve played any previous versions then you know what to expectthe gameplay is still fun and offers up that classic bustamove feel
it would have been nice to see some true upgrades but otherwise this is still a solid puzzle game that you can play against the computer or a human playera review for the vets
bub  bob take a back seat to some new unknown characters in this version but less importantly the gameplay remains the samethe game is priced cheap on here like new condition
if youre a fan go for it otherwise i hear there are better versions out there
but this works plenty fineplus how cool does that baby look on the coveri played this since i got it until i beat it at least  times
not only can you rock this against the computer you can put in a code and unlock even more levels and  more characters
look it up yourself
so when you start playing this youre like oh boy match the dots but once you get into the vs part of this game or even versus the cpu enjoy trying to win when the bubbles come piling upin puzzle mode youll be hard pressed to come up with the fastest way to clear the board and get a time bonus which you will rarely do unless you study the gameoverall for an old school ps game this is pretty awesomewhile there arent a lot of things to unlock the vs mode and playing against the computer will keep you busy so this is a good game for the pricegraphicscolorful eyecatching and creative
the cute graphics easily put me in a good mood though the moving backgrounds during gameplay can be a little bit distracting
overall i give the graphics an acharacterscute and funny each with their own unique bubble pattern
i was disappointed in the selection of characters upon first purchasing the game since id played a version of the game with cooler looking human characters
but over time i began to become attached to characters such as the mysterious acting miss t and the adorable little kitty mog
the only down side to the characters is that they will occasionally be distracting or they will block certain parts of the screen
i give the characters an agameplaythe game is very simple
you just tap the arrow keys to position your arrow then press x to shoot the bubble
the bubbles are different colors and your goal is to get three or more of the same color together which will make them blow up
the slightly harder part is keeping the bubbles from passing the line
it may sound complicated but thats because i cant explain it very well
it is actually the easiest play station game i have ever played
but it is also addicting
i recommend playing it when you want something simple but fun
i give gameplay an aoptionsthere are few options of gameplay
but the few options are fun especially chain reaction in the two player mode
i give the options of gameplay a boverallan enjoyable game
i recommend it to kids and adults considering that when we first bought it my parents were addictedfirst i should explain bustamove to those who havent touched a single bam game
basically its a more colorful version of tetris
you have different colored bubbles at the top of your screen
at the bottom a character shooting bubbles at the other bubbles
connect three or bubbles of the same color and they all pop
if they happen to be holding up any more bubbles those fall away and give you even more points
of course the balls are slowly dropping down and if they reach the bottom of the screengame over
nowif you have a girlfriend and you want her to play video games with you or just accept your game playing a bit morebuy this game
its addictive and cute and girls seem to love it
and the best thing is that i love it too
sure the graphics may be a little cartoonlike and cutesy but it adds to the game
there are plenty of levels to work your way through
there are eight playable characters to choose from  plus two unlockable characters
in the oneplayer story mode the difference in the characters doesnt come out too much except in their individual animations and their different lame endings but in twoplayer and oneplayer challenge mode the differences are a bigger deal
according to which character you choose different patterns of bubbles will fly onto your opponents screenso what more could you ask for
multiple play modes
got em
different cool characters
got em
replay value
got it
a game your girlfriend will actually play if she dislikes video games
got itwoohoo
capcom ported over both resident evil  and  for the dc
err sorry there anyway the third installment to the zombiefest series is easily the most action packedthus making it one of the best
the story however is just lackingjill valentine must escape from raccoon city
thats it
obviously capcom was looking for a quick buck
it turns out though that this quick buck rocks
its still the same thing its always beenshoot solve dumb puzzles get scared repeatbut it proves to still hold up even though its showing its age by now
the only real difference between this and any other re game is nemesisa big ugly freak in a long trench coat looking to take out all existing stars
membersand in case you missed out on the first re jill the coolest character in the re series just so happens to be a stars
member
nemesis will show up when you least expect it like the tyrant from re and scare you sillyyoure also faced with certain decisions when fighting him called live selection which will structure your course
this makes for replayability which is what i always felt the re series lacked
another new but small aspect is the ability to now make your own ammounfortunately its more of a waste of time than anything just give me the ammo
other than that its the same re youve been playing for years nowwhich is its only problem i felt a case of quotbeen there shot thatquot throughout jills journey
the sound is still fundamental to the game the voice actors are still poor though getting better the music still pales to the first re the control is even worse than the psx version the dc control design is to blame for that not capcom but you cannot go wrong picking this game upespecially for the price its going for
if you didnt pick up the psx versions of re  and  make sure you pick them up nowas in right now
hurrybefore the dreamcast kicked the bucket capcom decided to release conversions of theyre super smash hits resident evil  and  to the dc
resident evil  nemesis may be at the top of the list of the best re games and for good reason the nemesis
you play as jill valentine running and gunning your way through zombie infested raccoon city approx
 hours before the events in resident evil  while at the same dodging past the relentless nemesis which is one of the most nightmarish and invincible opponents in video game history
everything that made the original ps version so great is all retained here but that is also a flaw considering the graphic horsepower of the dreamcast is nonexistant
so while you do get faster loading times and some cleaned up character models this looks exactly like its ps cousin
also the controls are a little slippery as well especially with the joystick
a few extras are included you can select a costume for jill right from the beginning of the game and you can play mercenary mode right from the start as well
all in all if you missed it on the ps and own a dreamcast give this a tryevery resident evil game is good but i think that this one is one of the best
resident evil  i think is the hardest out of the lot but that made the game all the more interesting as i felt that the other two were a walk through
the graphics on the game are amazing and the game play is excellent
out of the three that are availble on the dreamcast i would buy in this order code veronica resident evil nemesis and then resident evil   this aside all of the resident evil games are worth having as the puzzles will keep you at it for along timethis was the first resident evil game i ever played but my old copy was on ps
this dreamcast version though doesnt offer much of an update other than smoothing the image
the game is fun and full of puzzles as the original ps version hadthe system is cool no question about it
it plays ps games most ps games and dvds
the games look cool well some of them but no systems release games look their best and play cool
if this were just the base system for the  or whatever price it retails at this would get  starsmadden is very cool im sure ssx is really cool too and getting a second controller and a movie is pretty nice too
the problem is that nhl  on the ps isnt all that goodthe ps version of it is much better
and while armageddon is an impressive looking and sounding movie this set would be far better with a good movie like the matrix or braveheartalso i cant tell for sure but the picture looks like its not a sony controller
if thats the case thats another minus because nonsony accessories are notorious for being junk although its possible this one is an exceptionsoget this if you like armageddon and want the games otherwise look for another setup or for just a system alonejak and daxter have returned once again after their epic adventures involving the mystery of the precursors they were ottselshow about that
in their previous adventures jak and daxter would normally have to take part in death races every now and then but in this game its all about the racing
fortunately the vehicles in this game are all armed with deadly weaponry which can be used to blow away the competition and thats what saves this game from being just another boring racing game and im not a big fan of racing
the game opens with jak and daxter in kras city a corrupt cesspool of a city under the thumb of a ganglord known as mizo
after escaping from his henchmen jak and daxter join with keira ashelin and torn at a reading of krews will if you remember krew was the supremely obese gangster jak did some jobs for in jak ii
the reading of the will is overseen by krews daughter rayn and a hologram message left by krew informs everyone at the reading that some wine they drank earlier in accordance to his will was poisoned
the only way they can get the antitode is for them to take part in the kras city racing circuit and win the championship race against krews rival mizo and his henchmen
you then take control of jak with daxter riding atop jaks vehicles holding on for dear life and drive one of several types of racing vehicles through different racing tracks and coliseums including through the streets of kras city haven city spargus and other new areasthe weapons and powerups that jak and his competitors use on their vehicles are powered by the different kinds of eco they collect which are strewn along the race tracks
yellow eco allows the use of machine guns missiles and grenades
red eco lets you use mines force fields and robotic gun turrets
blue eco lets your vehicle use turbo
green eco repairs any damage your vehicle may and will receive
dark eco which can be collected as you blow up your competitors temporarily increases the damage your weapons can do and improves powerups
the types of vehicles jak drives range between four main types an allrounder with good speed and maneuverability a larger trucklike vehicle with tougher armor a compact minicar with higher maneuverability and a jeeplike vehicle which appears to have no useful attributes i can think of
there are three vehicles available in each of the four racing cup challenges yellow red blue and green eco cups giving you  different vehicles to use by the end of the game
theyre all fully customizable as well you can change their paint jobs and fit them with different styles of fenders bumpers tires roof panels etc
these changes dont affect the performance of the vehicles but its still fun to have such freedom for customization
however you can tune your vehicles performance speed armor maneuverability etc
with the precursor orbs you earn after completing races and challenges and you get more orbs the higher you score for example getting fourth place gives you far less orbs than first place
plus in order to beat the main game you have to earn first place in every challenge which is a bit harder than it soundsnot only will jak have to score first in the regular circuit races by driving fast and blowing up his competition but hell have to win the other challenges he faces
there are artifact races similar to the artifact missions in jak  where you must gather more precursor relics than the other racers to win and there are freeze rallies where you have a preset time to beat by driving through the course as fast as possible and collecting freezers that temporarily stop the clock
then there are sport hunts where the racers compete to chase down and destroy the most targets such as out of control robots or raptorlike metal heads and then there are deathmatches my favorite where the racers battle each other in car combat like in twisted metal and the winner is the one with the most kills
there are other challenges as well and all of them offer varied and entertaining gameplay
the game can be unusually challenging for a racing game but in a fun waymost of the time
one circuit race actually has jak compete with other racers without the use of his weapons since someone tampers with jaks vehicle before the race begins its a real pain trying to score first place in this race without being able to fight back against your fully armed opponentsalso despite the fact that you can blow up your opponents during races and get a big lead on them somehow they always manage to catch up with you no matter how much of a lead youve got
one big flaw this game has is its broken autosave feature where the autosave icon that pops up after races doesnt go away
when this happened to me my game data was corrupted and i had to restart the game from scratch and i had already almost reached the games halfway point
that was quite annoying but one could easily bypass this saving glitch by disabling the autosave feature and only putting in the memory card when you do a manual save between races but be sure to take out the memory card afterwards or the game will start autosaving again on its own
despite these flaws this is a good game
the only reason why i didnt give it  stars is because its a racing game
no matter how good this game is on its own its still a racing game albeit one that you can blow people up in
the gameplay is fun and the graphics are just as great as they were in the previous jak and daxter games
the music is also a blast and really pumps you up for the high speed action with its alternative rock themes
theres also plenty of the classic humor of the series thanks to daxter as well as pecker
while i prefer the more traditional jak and daxter adventure games jak x combat racing is a game that fans of the series shouldnt miss out on even if theyre like me and arent big fans of racing gamesthis isnt the typical jak now youll be racing in a multitude of ways that means kill races tournament type missions and even death matches twisted metal style
whats better is you customize your car have many characters to choose from and more if there are saves on your memory card like other jaks rachet n clank and other naught dog games
the story mode doesnt downgrade on the usual interesting story either with a video after every race
if you were wanting a multiplayer jak you could do better
the only gripe two i bought corrupted data on my memory card so be careful when you buy look for latest version such as greatist hitsif you liked the racing in jak  then you will like thislots of fun freeform combat racingthis game is fun but make sure that you get rid off amo meanwhil pick up new at the same time well just about sometimesthe jak and daxter series is amazing
people argue that the second one is the best and i agree but they are all very good
this one is also good just naughty dog decided to go in a different flow
they decided to go with racing combat racing that is
i thought this was a great choice because people who are getting bored with the actionadventure jaks they can play this one which is a totally different flow but with the same themenow the jak and daxter series is known well for its great fantasy storyline
they didnt do too bad with this one but i already knew the storyline wasnt going to be as good as th last ones because its hard to come up with a good storyline for racing games
youre jak as always and combat racing has become the most popular sport in the jak world
before krew died he made a bet with an amazing racing team meanwhile krew had nobody to represent his team
so after jak won the world race in jak  he made a poison that he would give him and all his friends so that they would be forced to race for him if they wanted the antidote
as you probably know krew died in the second game so he was not able to give jak and his friends the antidote himself so he got his daughter to do it
now you must race as jak to save your life by winning the championshipthe gameplay is great
the thing that makes it so great is that its not just racing its combat racing
so you get to shoot your opponents with various weapons oyu pick up throughout the race
the game has all different kinds of races that you compete in
it has the circuit race turbo races time limit races demolitino derby and more
this lets you not get the feeling of being bored the only problem i have with all this different kinds of races is that you dont see as much circuit races as i would have liked to see
another problem with the racing is that the tracks are not made too well
what i mean by this is that many turns are way too sharp and most of the sharp turns come after a jump so you end up going up the jump and not being able to turn in the air so you crash into the wall in mid air
also your vehicle flips over a lot which gets annoying
probly the level that has the most of this is haven city in the sewers
the controls are great and easy to get into
and a cool thing about killing someone or when your car blows up is that everything goes into slow motion and it shows the car totally get destroyed and crash into the wall and do flips and stuff
and once you blow up your not eliminated you just start over from where you blew up and they have your car moving already so its not like oyu have to wate for acceleration
the car doesnt have that many cars only like  or so but the game lets you customize your vehicles which is great
throughout the game you win new parts like body wheels front pannels and sidepannels and what not
its great
the game also has multiplayer only i wish you could do more than just two players
but you can unlock new characters by having your memory card in with the previous jak games saved data on it
you can get characters like thee first jak and second jak
the game also has online play where you can join clans and stuffthe graphics are decent just like the last jak game
really no improvments which sucks but in this one there really isnt much of cutscenes
i would have liked to see more cutscenes because i love the characters in the jak world
the sound is also good with the machine guns and rockets they sound greatthis game is excellent not quite as good as the previous ones but it gives jak a new flow
i would really like to see an new one and you should defenitely pick this one up especially if you liked the jak series
the game is rated teen for crude humor fantasy violence language use of tobaccothis review was written by james shea my sona continuation and spinoff of the jak and daxter series jak x combat racing is similar in method to mario kart or diddy kong racing  a carbased version of a platformer gamethere is however a plot to the game unlike some other spinoff games
jak and his friends from jak  and  are gathered to read the will for krew the nowdeceased crime lord from jak  from the grave represented by a holographic message krew poisons all present with a special vintage of wine that serves as his funeral toast and then says the antidote will be given to them by one of his associates if they win the city championship
after this there are many twists as the various racers go through the championship modethe gameplay is based on the driving in jak  many of the controls should be familiar to players of that game
like most spinoff driving games there are weapons to be collected such as mines missiles and machine guns and drivingbased bonuses like turbo boosts and power sliding
the cars handle decently and control is for the most part acceptablethere are many upgrades for the cars as well these change the handling and physical appearance of the cars
for the most part the cars themselves have a rough mad max style appearance with a pretty good variety of car types
there are different colors and accessories availablethe graphics are about as good as the later jak games and there are cutscenes to illustrate the games storyline
the audio is again the same as the jak games
theres a fairly nice consistency despite its racer status it still feels like part of the total seriesoverall this couldve been a lot worse
it wasnt exceptional by any means but for a kart racer spinoff this couldve been a lot less well done
the fact that it was tied into the real story was also a nice bonus
but mainly its so generically done that there isnt any reason to recommend or not recommend itrating this is a pure skill game and is not like the normal jak seriesit takes some practice but overall i and my family played it over several days and very much enjoyed it
it has good replay potential toobuying different tires when available is well worth itit is a great game at a moderate price associating racing with fighting
it takes a while before being redundanti was a big fan of rogue squadron for the n
factor  did an amazing job on the audio and the challenging gameplay made it one of lucasarts top games
now comes battle for naboo a game which clones the gameplay of the its predecessor but changes the setting from the classic star wars films to the prequel moviesyes i agree that perhaps bfn is a tad repetitive and extremely similar to rs but the game still holds enough variety in the missions and hidden surprises to keep one interested
what i enjoyed the most was the storyline
rather than tread over characters and scenes everyone saw in the film bfn takes you behind the scenes and you get to play out an original adventure
and the climactic battle against the droid control ship of episode  is a real pleasure to playwith an already triedandtrue engine lucasarts gives a game that should be played until every secret is found
an excellent gameps
in case there are some who dont know putting the code talktome as your passwords opens up a dvd type voiceover track for all the main missions
excellent additioni have seen better starwars games but this one is still pretty good
in this game you dont just fly in your basic naboo space ship fighter seen in the movie you have all kinds of things to take control of like a land speeder
its a good starwars game and who ever liked quotroguequot squadronquot will most likly like this one
there very alikethis game is available these days
it is a fun game but it didnt keep my interest for too long
i would  have preferred this game if it had all the real atv models instead of using a bunch of fictitious atvs mixed with real ones
i realize they are trying to push current atvs but the best quads ever made were the cycles of the late sive gotten interested in atvs recently
unfortunately a sport atv is slightly out of my price range right now
so i did the next best thing bought this video gamethe game is a bit dated
the graphics are not on par with todays newer atv racing games
however you can still enjoy this game
and the sounds of the games atvs are the actual sounds of their realworld counterpart for example
the stroke yamaha banshee has been discontinued
if ever you wanted to hear the eerie haunting sound of that atv today you will have to get this game
due to increasingly stringent regulations some of the atvs in the game are no longer made
you wont be hearing that famous yamaha banshee wail anymore outside the gamethe game itself is straightforward
and so are the controls
however most of the games within the game are challenging
especially the pro career mode
it is still a good game
the simple controls make this game highly recommended for younger playersas part of the pss new greatest hits lineup atv off road fury is a solid racing title that any ps owner cant go wrong with
the graphics are fantastic and the atvs respond realisticly
the controls are solid and the soundtrack really stands out
alice in chains soundgraden sevendust bender anthrax and primus
not bad
while the fun factor can wear thin atv off road fury is a solid title and racing enthusiasts will enjoy itif you ride atvs for real and know how they react to different terrain and conditions you will really appreciate this game
the atvs you can ride are based on real models by kawasaki suzuki banshee etc the graphics are realistic and smooth and the races are challenging
you can unlock a cool  cc atv when you beat the first set of races and the games soundtrack includes real songs mostly alt rock
my only gripe with the game is there is no water or mud bogs to ride through
aside from that the game is great for anyone who is into offroad atv drivingsim coaster is like a follow up to sim theme park
there are  zones to build off of
pros in the game are the colorful images and the ability to ride your rides that you build is fantasic
the cons are the terrible lack of shops and roller coasters
im probably saying this because of rcts big amount of rides and roller coasters doesnt compare to rct
another problem i have with this game is the guests
they are so stupid
i put a lot of bathrooms fries hot dog and drinks stand and the people say they are thristy and hungry still
although rc tycoon only has adult men in the game
sim coaster has variety of people like kids adults and grandparents
it doesnt compare to rct
if you are looking for a great management game choose this for its unique challenges choose this game
if you want a game just about creating roller coasters choose rec insteadthe original theme park  was for its time a fantastic game
it had great graphics beautiful sound and it was very challenging
last year the sequel theme park world came out
i found it a huge dissapointment
the graphics were pretty good and sound as well but the game wasnt challenging at all
it returned it the day after i bought it i finished 
it in  day  now theres simcoaster or theme park inc it uses the graphicsengine of theme park world
like i said the graphics were pretty good a year ago but now theyre a little dated
still its very amusing to see your park running and theres no other game that lets you ride your own coasters
the thing thats really good about this game is the gameplay
the game starts off a little easy but when you progress through the game it gets very challenging
just like rollercoaster tycoon youll get cetain missions so youve got a goal to play to
this keeps you playing
if you like these kind of games you should buy itthe fun level goes up and down on this game
the fun goes away at the last objective
it is too hard to beatsome older kids might not like it but if ur like  or younger this is a perfect game for youif you want a serious challenge with a great story and alot of creatures jumping from all dark corners then this is your game
the boss creatures in the game are very tough especially the final one
the graphics were solid the sounds were solid and the game was solid
what kept this from being a truly awesome game was there was a little too much story telling
seemed like every time you turned around you had another cut scene
and most of the weapons werent all that good and neither was the magicbut one of the neat features was the scrye spell
it let you see things that happened in the past
and when you used it while looking at some pictures they looked different
very cool
you just have to see for yourselfoverall this was a solid game that had some creepy music to set you up for quite a few good scares
gave me goose bumps the whole time i played it
could have done better with the weapons and the spells but still worth the money and the time
good luckmy favorite pc game of all time is halflife
at the risk of sounding like a nutcase halflife actually disturbed my sleep paterns it caused me violent nightmares and ate up any free time i had for the time it took for me to complete the only fps i have ever beaten without cheating i might add
since then i have been waiting for hl which is inevitableenter undying
as a huge clive barker fan  both his books and his painting  i was excited to hear that he was involved with a video game and nervous that it would end up like stephen kings   talk about horror
i knew very little about the game but the previews were encouragingas soon as i loaded it i knew i was in for less sleep mouse induced wrist cramps and general vgfs video game fatigue syndromevisually amazing
the environments i have seen so far are fluid and believable
the special effects and lighting are amazingsound even better than the graphics
the monsters scare the hell out of you the positioning of sound add to the eeriness of the location and the soundtrack is moviecaliberoverall  the monsters and gameplay will make you jump out of your seat
a quiet unassuming walk down a corridor is interrupted by a ghost or monster and it is done better than any slasher film youve ever seen
the only complaint is the fact that the tension is too often broken by loading of new areas but this does not kill the game by any means
and the only reason i gave it  stars is because i havent completed the game yet  i still have a life although i can see this sucking up a lot of itif you liked halflife this is the perfect game
if you like clive barkers horror style  this is the perfect game
if you dont like being scared  buy something elsefirst of all i am biased
i love most of clive barkers work and i liked the movies based on his writings
but that doesnt mean i gave him a free pass while evaluating this game
also i never purchased unreal tournament just didnt like the whole conceptafter playing the game for about two hours i am completely lost in the big irish mansion well actually i just opened the wrong door and i am now lost in some lower dimension running low on health and have quotdiedquot about  times already but i like this game
the games engine is wonderful the lighting effects textures and character movement are great
the plot is also wonderful its the main reason why i dont get that sense of futility that comes with playing mediocre gamesthis game does have the familiar quotfind the keyquot type puzzle but it does not have the standard quotrun  jump  shootquot action of most fps games
undying is more like a quotwalk  investigate  what happened to the lights
 duck
 thats not my reflection in the mirror
 now runquot type of game
this game adds many barkerish touches the long gloomy hallway with the white curtains wafting gently across it  pure genius
that add to undyings qualityaside from the care taken by undyings creators to provide the right atmosphere the user interface is very easy to understand and configure
the dual weaponspell control is a little daunting at first but i am getting used to itone reviewer compared this game to resident evil
that game is a mess that bored me to tears
undying is a really engrossing spooky adventure
electronic arts and mr barker have created a superior gaming product that is well worth amazons price and my prediction is that it will be popular for many yearsdespite some of the shortcomings in the combat and difficulty balance undying is a classic video game that succeeds in immersing a player into a classic horror moviethe story takes place during the s in ireland where a debt is owed and a family estate with a history of black magic practice wields the ghosts of a bitter sibling rivalryits a viable story involving likeable interesting characters and pullsoff some of the scariest moments in the history of video gamesthe howlers come out of nowhere and their blows are felt as your screen develops a red glaze and your vision becomes disoriented for a moment after each hityour weapon of choice is in your left hand and spells are cast in your right which is odd at first but becomes comfortable enough
the interface is different but well done and intuitive
you can also levelup your spell of choice giving undying a minor rpg touchthe unreal engine for the most part looks great and the its the actual artwork of the designers that makes the graphics so impressive and immersive rather than the unreal engines capabilities alone
at times the sky textures are very ugly and doomlike for such a new game
but the great character models foreground textures and overall level design make up for it big time
make no mistake undying is an impressive game visually you wont be disappointed in that areathe latter levels are a bit out of place but are fun regardless and the boss battles involve patterns that take a few times to get down but are generally enjoyable as wellthe gameplay does have a bit of variety requiring you to find someone or blow something up or find an object which takes some exploring and logical thought making it more than just your typical fpsfinally undying scared  me at times the howlers stuck with in my dreams at night while i played this game and you know a games done its job when that happensthe only complaint i have is that the games difficulty settings are too far apart but playing on normal is a good way to go through the first time it still can be challenging in various areasthis is probably my fourth first person shooter that i have played and it is way up there on the listi absolutely loved deus ex and i find that undying does not match its unparalleled interaction and character enhancement however for anything that it lacks undyings graphics and story line make up for it big time
thats why i am giving it   starswhile i was skeptical about the other reviews expressing that this game is really scary i am now a believer
this game is really scary
i have never experienced anything like that while playing a game
turn down the lights put up the sound and get ready
the combination of weapons magic and graphics make for an exciting and immersive experienceif you enjoy first person shooters and are interested in a serious adrenalin rush this game has got your name on iti like to be scared
from all ive heard about this game i knew i was going to be in for a good fright
unfortunately there were some annoyances to this game that completely ruined it for me
just when you are getting into the game you enter a door and the gameplay stops to load data
not a big deal but it happens more frequently than you would think
i simply could not get into the game because of this
the horror factor was not really there for me either
while some of the scenes characters and monsters were somewhat creepy i was never scared
plus just when you might think you are getting scared you get the dreaded loading screen which just kills the moment
it took a while for me to get used to the controls
i reassigned the default configuration of spells and weapons to the keyboard
also you cant autoreload your pistol which can be a nuisance when trying to kill a monster that is in your face
the developers of the game shouldve come up with a better save game system
its horrible
the worst part of the game for me was the random crashes that happened on a somewhat frequent basis
i have an amd  with k ram and an ati radeon  with  megsi was extremely dissapointed with the final encounter with the undying king
i didnt even know that i killed the thing until i got the loading screen
my computer crashed about  minute into the final scene so i do not know exactly what happenedso why did i give the game a 
because the game is truly beautiful to look at and a delight to hear
that in itself was worth the frustration that i experienced either due to a crash or the constant loading screen
in my opinion the gameplay is typical of a fps but the textures and environments are awesome
the score was also top notch and blended very well with the gameplay
i think that the most scared i got during the game was due to some of the very eerie sound effects as i walked around the mansionalthough this game is pretty old by now and although i have had it for a long time i just wanted to add my review here to pay my respect for the developers because this game has been underrated by customers
perhaps because of its rating
nevertheless this is a wonderful game with a very very nice story excellent characters really pretty graphics for its time superb sound effects and a chilling soundtrack that all comes together magically to give the player an unforgettable horrormovie like fps experiencei remember the times i used to play this game at home with all the lights turned off
and seriously there were many times i jumped with horror or times i couldnt take the fear of waiting to be killed in the dark or fear of being attacked and shut down my pcthe weapons spells enemies enemy ai dialogue script plot whatever you need in a great fps this game has itat this price range today if you like the genre this is a must buyi have played many many fps games
doom
doom   quake
duke nukem
half life
aliens vs predator just to name a few
and none of them not even halflife or avp could have prepared anyone for thisthis game is terrifying beyond all belief
not since silent hill has there been a game so utterly nerve wracking
i have played games that were designed to scare you but this from the mind of horror master clive barker will have you trembling in your seat
unexpected occurences such as monsters bursting through walls the ground suddenly falling out from under you terrible shrieks that sound like they came from right behind youyou walk into a dark room and see nothing
the door slams shut you turn aroundthe beast standing there will take your head off if you arent fast enoughcrisp beautiful graphics that look great even on older video cards such as voodoo  and incredible sound effects make this game what it is
very cool weapons such as the tibetan war cannon which shoots a blast of ice at your enemies and amazing looking spells such as the ectoplasm which fires bolts of pure energy at your enemies are just some of the weapons you will use
there is duelweilding where you hold your weapon in your right hand and your left hand is free for spell casting
spell power can be upgraded through mana wells found throughout the game
helpful items such as ether traps can keep monsters at bay while you try to find your way outthe story is rather good but there are many events in the game that will get you sidetracked while you are trying to perform a task asked of you by one of the npcs and then all of a sudden you find yourself being led one way by something else when you are trying to go the other waythere are some other annoying aspects such as being unable to backtrack so if you miss something thats it youve missed it
doors will often shut behind you and will be unable to be opened again
there are also many doors throughout the game that cannot be accessed  until much later in the game where you will find yourself scrambling around the many beautifully detailed areas in the game trying to find them again
there are quite a few monster types in the game
however at some parts these monsters respawn at an overwhelming rate and some of these creatures are very difficult to kill because of their unique skillsthe inventory system and weapon selection systems were rather annoying as well with the  and  keys cycling forward and back through weapons respectively and  and  to cycle through spells
there is a button that allows you to access a weapon wheel where all weapon icons are displayed on screen allowing you to pick which one you want
however if you have to quickly switch weapons in a tense situation both methods are rather difficult to pull offdespite those gripes the game itself is very good
the monsters are scary the ability to cast a spell that shows you things that are not normally there such as ghosts and alterations in the scenery which will help you understand the story or just plain terrify you add to the atmosphere and mood of the game
if you are a fan of horror and fps games this one is for you
not for the weak of heart
difficult controls but all in all a good gamesingle player first person shooterif i would of known then what i know now about the game i would have waited
the game play graphics music are all really good
what is the best about the game is the story
here is a suggestion for when playing  do it in a dark room
everytime i went to bed i was scared crazy just walking down my short dark hall to the bedroom
the atmosphere it presents is truly awesome
how can you resist a haunted house with creatures flying at you or popping up thru the floor boards
or even running around in a mausoleum not knowing where to hide
unfortunately the game dies off at the end and once youve played it you know what to expect
so replayability is kind of out the window
i tried starting another game recently and it still is as scary as ever
but the problem is i know whats going to happen in the storyline
also the bosses are not too hard to get rid of
just takes some practice and you got it down everytime you face one
so thats why i mentioned that at this price its not a bad game at allpatrick galloway adventurer set out to become a debunker of superstition and the supernatural
instead he becomes a believer and a highly sought after expert at combating hostile forces from beyond this plane
it is for this reason that he returns to his native ireland in  his former commanding officer during the great war jeremiah covenant has summoned his old friend to free his family of the ancient curse that threatens to destroy its every memberbarker truly created a superb atmosphere in this game
it reminds one of a lovecraft or hodgson story but with a generous helping of barkers trademark creepiness mixed in
the overall plot the main characters the monsters and above all the level design are all first rate
the covenant mansion is probably the most intricately designed building that ive ever seen in a game but you also have a huge monastery which exists in two times the family mausoleum catacombs lighthouse pirates lair oneiros a dream dimension the land of eternal autumn etc
the environments are incredibly large detailed and elaborate you have entire worlds in this thingi somehow missed this game when it first came out in  that is just as well
if like me your system will not run the latest games then this is a chance to run something first rate that an older system can handle you might also like to check out heretic ii another overlooked gem
my only complaint is the load times
when you play this game you might like to keep a book or magazine handy
ive never seen so much loading in a level or such long load times
it is almost like they tried to do too much with the technology available at the timenot a fan of the horror genre ive never read clive barkers books but i have to tell you that undying gave me the same spooky feeling i had when i was a kid watching midnight horror movies
to fans of the horror scene cliver barker is considered a quotmaster of the macabrequot and id say that the programmers of this game couldnt have given the author a better conversion to the pcfrom the great music and sound effects that set the mood to the constantly changing murky or gloomy settings this game has an atmosphere to it that i havent seen with many pc games
even the gameplay has elements of fright
an example is the grim reapers scythe as a weapon and the magic ability to foresee the future that turns everyday objects into bloody projectionsit seems that not many fps firstperson shooter games come up with original concepts these days but undying has managed to invent a new concept for firstperson shooters
even better the abilities of the character are configured in a control system that makes perfect sense
if you own a mouse with a scroll and more than  buttons you wont need to use the keyboard muchif you dont enjoy fps games you might want to give this one a try
a demo is available on various websites that you will give you a feel for the game
i hadnt given firstperson shooters much attention in the last few years but undying renewed my interest for these types of games
duke nuke em rainbow  the operative quake  some of the firstperson shooters that set precedents for the market and id add clive barkers undying on the same list
the entire horror concept of this game deserves mention as it does one of the best jobs in pc gaming history of projecting it to the audiencesome of the negatives include  no online multiplayer mode provided  the game can be completed perhaps too quickly if you dont adjust it to a difficult level and  while the horror scene impresses the heck out of you at the beginning it dies down near the end of the game
disclaimer  the game says that the following mb video cards are not suggested for this game dfx voodoo banshee cards powervr neon  cards s savage  cards sc savage  cards sis  cardsyou better leave the lights on for this one kiddies
clive barkers undying has excellent gameplay that makes you jump up on your seat grab the mouse and scream as you curse obscenities at the foe your trying to kill
though it does not have a very wide veriaty of weapons the ones you get are very wickednow the graphics are excellent some of the best i have seen for a first person shooter in a while
the enemies are desighned very well to give you a extremelly scary feelind
and get some new pants ready becouse theres a lot of surprises that will scare the crud out of youfor the story its slright but needs a little work
very good ending that leaves things open for a sequalif you read this review i hope you use it to determin to buy the game or not so if you do enjoywow
how did i miss this game when it came out
i purchased it on a whim recently and found one of the best realized most entertaining and scariest shooters ive ever played
the idea of placing it in s ireland is brilliant
it oozes with atmosphere and the time period combines the best of both the th and early th centuries ie
th century atmosphere with somewhat modern th century weapons  at least the ones that arent magical
the music graphics pacing lighting level design and quotenemiesquot both human and other are right on
there is even an incredibly well realized magical city to visit and eventually subdue
this is one of the few games that has really scared me the old adrenaline was really pumping
the most disappointing aspect is the ending bad enough to warrant the loss of a star
the final quotbossquot or monster is so ridiculous it seems like almost an afterthought to the high quality shown in the rest of the game
purchase it  especially now when its such an incredible valuegreat gameplay the best base building formula rts ive played in a long time
right up there with ground control
only downside is the fact that youre fighting on arrakis
what a horrible planet
ah yes and the game plays a little too fastalright here we have the next step for rts games fully drendered battlefields
some have said that the dune landscape doesnt offer much in the way of asthetics but if you have a powerful enough computer to crank the detail it looks absolutely stunning and downright real
that said eventhough you do need an accelerator card to run emperor the basic requirements dont seem very steep
ive got an athlon   ram with a mb geforce  card and it runs pretty darn smooth with medium detail at  resolution
enough with the techietalk thoso far as unit balance and diversity emperor is one of the best rts games i have ever played each side has clear strengths and weaknesses you must expolit and defend
this game is far from just a rush n attack style rts
the subhouses do well to somewhat make up for certain weakpoints in your army as well as let you tailor your forces to your specific strategies
battles are typically pretty quick as opposed to other rts games which can drag on endlesslymy only gripe really is that theres only one mode of play for skirmishnet games
red alert  had diffrent rule sets you could download to make a battle all infantry extra money etc and older westwood games had the tech level slider weswood neds to bring one or both of those features backthe acting and storyline are kinda lame but eh they serve their purposethe seller was amazon
i purchased it in  for  bucks
it installed fine on my pc running windows xp home sp
while playing the game it crashed several times so i was careful to save my progress regularly during the campaignthis is a realtime strategy rts game
the campaign includes movielike cut scenes which are fairly welldone
there is single player campaign or skirmishes or multiplayer lan or internetthere are  cds install house atreides house harkonnen house ordos
for the single player campaign you can pick what house you want to play as
although the maps are similar for each housecampaign the cut scenes are different
aside from the  main houses other characters are also featured in the game like ix guild sardaukar fremen tleilaxu etcwhen i tried multiplayer internet the game went into a continuous loop with error message error starting internet components check installation is correct
its an old game so the servers probably dont exist anymorethere is a patch for the game version i replayed this game recently and i thought it was still fun
the graphics sound dialog and game play have heldup well over time
lots of movie details are included as part of the game for example the fremen fedaykin can deploy a thumper call a worm and ride the worm around the sand for a while for fun or to takeout nearby enemies
they did a good job recreating the dune universe in this gamei also enjoyed the movie frank herberts duneand the bookim glad to have this game in my collection and i look forward to replaying it again the futurevisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionswell this game was pretty good at the time it was released but ai is just to stupid to play single player and multiplayer is poor
i would say if you like real time strategies generels zero hour is far better choice this game is definitely not worth its current price although  years ago it was funi have been playing rts since dune ii was released so i know what i am talking about when it comes to rtsthis game retains the nostalgic elements of dune ii although the concrete slabs are now gone 
the world westwood created through the novel is very believable and well done
the graphic is very spectacular even at the minimal setting but it is a very demanding game
i have  mhz athlon with mb ram and a geforce mx card and it tends to slow down when the screen gets intense
the music brought back memories from the original dune ii which is excellentgameplay is good but not revolutionary
imo unit controlling could be better
after playing starcraft i was disappointed with lack of many commandsit seems like westwood is having problems with their server as of writing this
i have dsl and i either get kicked or get very poor ping
hopefully this will be remedied soonbesides the minor quirks this game is very entertainingemperor is a passable rts with pretty good graphics but unoriginal and somewhat tired gameplay
i can only comment on the single player aspect but if youre looking for something new you wont find it here
yes the game is in quotdquot but plays almost exactly like its d predecessors
the missions become quite repetitive where you build up a defensive force then just mine enough spice to create a large group of quottankquot units combined with a large group of quotlight tankquot units and storm the enemy base
repeat ad nauseum
often times youll have  missions in a row on the same map
it may just be that im looking for more than the rts genre can supply but this is an average game in my bookall right ive heard all the complaints i ever want to about how westwood never does anything new with its campc franchise
but hey it works doesnt it
time and again experiments have shown that changing a triedandtrue formula usually ends in disaster
just look at force commander if you dont believe me
additionally with emperor they really have done something newobvious things first the graphics
youll immediately notice this unless you are blind
they are more than impressive but utterly astonishing in detail and workmanship
you can zoom pan and rotate to see the different vehicle models all done in gorgeous d aside from the structures and units combat looks fantastic
i was almost tempted to blast my own base after missions just to see the fireworksthe single player campaigns are far more interesting since you can ally yourself with any of five different subhouses each offering tempting units
you can also attack and defend at will and when you defend your old bases will be reactivated
its an interesting touch and one that makes the campaigns much more fun than any previous dune or campctype game
youll also get various secondary objectives some of which can be pretty fun to carry outthe balance is excellent
each house has its strengths and weaknesses as do the subhouses
i dont think the debate will ever end as to which combination works best since its really just a matter of favoritesof course no game is without its problems and emperor is no exception
i found that defending in the campaigns is laughably easy if you just attack your intruder right away
youll also probably know the map so you can exploit its advantages to better destroy thempathfinding can be a pain at times
although it does work it seems they tried to make units have realistic space to take up which means they dont bump into each other
this is cool to a certain extent and that limit is when you cant move something from point a to point bthe acting is a bit forced
im not one to complain too much about cinematics and actors since theyre only there to augment the game but at times it was really quite bad
the atreides mentat in particular struck me as an evil person which just doesnt fit the housethe plot is weird
i cant really explain it otherwise other than to recommend you read the books theyre great anyway
i know the folks at westwood are leaning more towards the movie version of dune not the novel
however the way they have taken the story seems an amalgamation of elements from god emperor of dune the movie and well something
for example they never really explained how the atreides recovered from being handily slaughtered by the harkonnen and sardaukar
this will probably be of concern only to a dune purist though and should not deter you from playing the gameall in all emperor was a pretty riveting experience
if you were disappointed by dune  basically just a remake of dune  then you will want to check this one out
it surely wont disappointokay i know that most of you that are going to buy this game know that you can control like  units at once
if you have played age of empires then you know that only  units in that game can be selected at a time and the population limit is usually   shoguns combat system is much more complex thus making the learning curve steepershogun has  different main interfaces when you are playing the game
though i am quite new to this game the quotstrategy mapquot section which shows all of the provinces under your control and lets you build units and buildings in that province is very simple to understand
it is regular turnbased strategy where every  turns you get the report of your yearly harvest which is your income
now the unit system is not as complex as aoe age of empires but the battle system makes up for that
when you send an army shown on your strategy map into a province that is not ruled by you the next turn the game will ask you if you want to commence the battle by yourself let the computer decide or just run away becuase you do not want to fight
usually you want to do the battle by yourself so then you are taken into the quotbattle modequot
battle mode is not turn based
instead it is real time just like aoe
the quottutorialquot gives you a first hand look in battle mode but tutorial has a problem where they tell you to click on a flag you click on the flag and the program calls you a fool for not following directions
so thus tutorial is basically useless
anyways the battles in shogun are huge
you may find youself running away just to come back with a bigger army
or you may find yourself fraggin the computer cause your army is x the size of hisshogun comes with some bugs thus reducing my rating of it to  stars
the first is the one that i mentioned about the tutorial
the next is about the geisha house
i can never find the option to build it even though i have all of the requirements
also patching the game is confusing
i downloaded the most recent patch and installed it
what i got was a menu that was so messed up that i couldnt even exit the game from it
overall buy shogun total war warlord edition
it will get you ready for medieval total war the next game coming from the same developersthis is certainly on my must own list
i have been playing this game for many years and although the graphics are out dated the game still plays great
it has a turn based element in it much like master of magic with a real time battle complete with units and tactics
all the elements are here for a great gaming experience wonderful historic back drop with the warrior mystique created by ninja samurai and the geisha cultures molded into a superb gaming package
i rated it a  overall because the graphics are a little dated but for a great time its worth the investment
the real issue here is that this is the real warlords edition
the shogun total war gold and shogun total war editions both seem to have fatal errors on my equipment
in the warlords edition there is a different opening video and there is no thrown room and i suspect that the errors are based on the programing around this thrown room
make sure that you are buying the electronic arts version warlords edition without the thrown room interface to get a smooth running program
i had to go back and purchase the warlords edition after first making the mistake of buying the gold edition
although the game would have been better had the thrown room actually worked having to constantly try and trick your computer into playing the game past the fatal errors is tedious and time consuming taking away much from the playing experience
this version rocksmy homebuild is as follows   bit prescott core intel p at ghz  gig of mhz x dual channelmemory onboard sound  surround intel perl motherboard nvidia extreme  meg agp and windows xp professional
this machine is a budget gamer but with over  game titles in my library from call of duty  to dos titles like ultima  the silver seedi have very few games that have problems running on this machine in some fashion
make sure you get the right versionfirst a patch was released months ago in  that fixed the problems that n ferguson referred to especially the one involving reinforcements
find the patch at totalwarcomthis is a game that in complexity is more difficult than most rts games but less complex than most wargames
the gameplay combines a turnbased strategy phase in which the player using a riskstyle map of japan makes longterm decisions as to which province to invade what buildings to construct and where to deploy his armies
the realtime phase occurs when a battle is fought and the player attempts to defeat his rival
the battles are tactical and success depends on many different factors troop numbers experience weapons formations weather battlefield maneuvering and terrainalthough the graphics are usually highlypraised by most people and in truth there is much to praise i was very disappointed with the troop graphics
despite having a highend machine and the latest graphic card the d troop sprites are too tiny and difficult to distinguish even before combat
when cavalry arent easily differentiated from archers and archers can be mistaken for spearmen and a gamer with  vision like myself has to move to within  inches of the computer screen to fight a battle something is wrong
i dont care how beautiful the terrain is or how interesting the cut scenesother nongame graphics may be equally stunning but it doesnt matterthe troop graphics are extremely tiny
many reviewers defend this with sarcasm well so what if you cant see the troopers faces
if you want age of empires go play that
hey how else can you get  men on the screeni say quotso what
why bother with troop graphics in that case
why bother trying to make them look like anything thenquoti dont care about making out tiny details
i do care about spotting my archers easily from my arquebusers
i do care when my spearmen look much too much like my cavalrymenyou may not care about the graphics and enjoy the game regardless
you should be aware however that it is an issue that have put off many other playersjourneyman project title
first of all you must understand that this game is made by presto studios not cyan the original company to design riven and myst
do you remember the journman project series
same maker
if you compare the graphics quality of journeyman and say riven you see a big difference
becuase of the  degree free look movement system that has been featured in journeyman project  and myst iii the quality is downgraded
to tell you the truth this game just doesnt seem to make the myst title
it doesnt quite feel the same as riven or myst
the plot is excellent though just what you would expect in a myst game
when they say quotthe story of myst continuesquot they arent kidding
if you are just starting to get into the myst series go ahead and buy riven which is the sequel to myst
i think it might impress you more
if your a hardcore myst fan go ahead and buy
it will be a good buythis latest game in the myst series does what the others did  take computer fantasy gaming to the next technological level
with fantastic graphics and a  degree view of every mouse click exile recreates its imaginary places with precision and believability
the music is wonderful the scenery compelling and the puzzles as challenging as those in the previous two games
i will say that having played both myst and riven i now know how to approach the enigmas of this game which makes them seem easier than they are
people who havent played riven for example or who played it long ago may not recognize clues when they see them
for them this will be a longer but no less enjoyable gameat first i found the  turns dizzying and confusing but quickly got used to them
the individual worlds here seem smaller and less dependent than in previous games but i accepted that as part of the superior graphics package
i appreciated the four cd format that doesnt require the constant disc changing of riven
i experienced no bugs with my version although i use a mac which might make a difference
because the windows and mac systems use the same disks however i suspect the makers have since fixed many of the problems in their later productionsget this game
like the others this requires innovative approaches to problems instead of brute force
the puzzles are sufficiently complicated so a user cant solve them by random trying
for mac os x users this is a classic environment game
also ubi soft assumes youll have a right mouse click option circumvent it by using the shift keyi thought riven was incredibly gorgeous and it was for its time myst exile however blows it utterly out of the water
there were times when i was laughing aloud because i was so enjoying the scenery in this game
some of the soundtracks are just magical too
one world in particular a small island with a large resident bird was just stunning both in scenery and in soundtrackthe puzzles could be a bit tricky to work out in some areas and at times the paths were incredibly difficult to find however the degree viewing was wonderful
brad dourif does an excellent job of playing the bad guy saavedro and there are a few truly enchanting creatures along the way
some of the puzzles are really charming in their cleverness too and youll feel a great sense of accomplishment if you manage them all without resorting to a cheat websitetruly a wonderful game top to bottom and suitable for all ages though younger children may need adult help to solve some puzzles theyll surely enjoy romping through many of the worlds
highly recommendedblowing away the previous competition with its eye popping slendor myst  continues the proud tradition of combining the beauty grace and mystery myst has become synonomus with into a new experienceyes the format is the same and the story does feel lacking at times but so does all myst stories at times being essentially a story that unfolds to the player in his or her own wayone thing the new developers should have concentrated more on was the sense of history and intruige that initially sucked in most of the players this game compensates too much of that for simply a gorgeous looking game through and throughthe third installment in the myst series brings us yet another adventure into the beautiful and enchanting worlds of atruss creation
the story begins in tomahna a tranquil world where atrus and his family now reside
upon catherines suggestion you wait inside the study for atruss return
once your old friend arrives he discusses his plans for the dni and the newly created age of releeshahn
however his dialogue is cut short when a strangelooking intruder warps into the room steals the releeshahn book and immediately links away using his own linking book
determined to recover the stolen book you follow the wild man and link to jnanin the lesson ageas you try to recapture the releeshahn book you must once again use your wits to solve the puzzles that saavedro has placed before you
though it would seem that saavedro is clearly your adversary as you move throughout the ages linked from jnanin and explore your surroundings untangling the various challenges he has constructed you gradually begin to piece together this tortured mans story and understand his motives
its an unfortunate story that began with atruss malicious sons sirrus and achenar before atrus had learned about their treacherous nature
i thought this made for a great plot since it ties in with the previous myst games and actually makes you sympathize with the villain
throughout your quest youll travel to four main ages each with a unique environment music and set of puzzles
in the first three element ages to which you can travel in any order your essential goal is to find that worlds unique symbol and bring it back to the lesson age
voltaic is the age of energy where youll need to harness and channel power to a particular part of the island
amateria is the age of dynamic forces in which you will need to finish a circuit of track in order to ultimately find the symbol
the structures and puzzles of this age make it feel like an amusement park and its a fun world to explore and interact with
edanna the nature age was definitely my favorite world
this scenic age is teeming with life and your job here is to discover how the plants and animals interact and respond to various stimuli
once youve discovered the three symbols you will unlock the fourth and final world narayan the age of balance where you will need to solve the glyph puzzle and finally face off with saavedroas before the controls are simple  you use the mouse to control your movement and interact with your surroundings
the puzzles are still pretty challenging requiring a good deal of patience and experimentation
in a game that focuses so much on keen observation of the sights and sounds of your surroundings its particularly important to have a game that excels in both its graphic presentation and its soundtrack
and myst iii does not disappoint
the graphics are fantastic making the worlds really come alive with aweinspiring splendor
the music and the sounds are likewise amazing
the soundtrack really fits well with the ages and the story
and the main theme just rocksmy only real complaint is that i wish the game were longer
nonetheless exile is a remarkable sequel in the myst series and if you enjoy a good challenge and have a lot of patience you should give this game a trywhen i heard myst iii would not be designed by the creators of myst and riven i had my doubts
but it turns out that puzzlewise myst iii holds up pretty well with myst and riven
graphicswise myst iii gives you the familiar quotmystlikequot landscapes and gadgetry buttons levers valves oh my
 but in one location the images are breathtakingly beautiful and quite unlike anything ive seen in a myst game or any game
although the images are all at x the only resolution offered by the game the bit colors plus directd produce greatlooking result
old video cards that dont support bit color like voodoo will not be able run the game in directd mode
but there is a quotsoftwarequot mode that works with all video cards albeit the graphics would be quite pixellated and quotjaggyquot
the game comes in  discs
if you dont want to swap cds while  playing do a quotfull installquot it will take up  to  gigabytes hard drive space
i didnt encounter any bug while playing the gameif you hope for freedom of movement in a d environment like in realmyst myst iii will disappoint you
you still navigate the same way you did in myst and riven  from one fixed quotnodequot to another
the difference is at each node you can quotmouselookquot ie
look in all directions by moving the mouse around
this degree panning method is nothing new i first saw it done in microsoft bookshelf  of all places
you basically look at a big d image being encircled around you to get the illusion of looking at a d space
the illusion is enhanced with occasional animations that quite seamlessly blend in with the background
even at d and x the images look lifelike enough for me to feel immersiveif you have never played any myst game before all myst games are about solving puzzles that generally  require you to understand a complex system then  to figure out its purpose and  to achieve that purpose
the main storyline is usually that all these systems puzzles locations etc
are quotmanufacturedquot by one man who in the beginning sends you to those locations and achieve some goals for him
the first myst game achieved immense popularity due partly to its simple interface exotic atmosphere the lack of violence and sex certainly didnt hurt
it was highly accessible to general gamers
hardcore gamers have often blamed myst for diluting the art of game design but perhaps simplicity is sometimes what a game needs for it to be enjoyablelastly when you play the myst iii have pencil and paper handy
you will often need to jot notes and sketch drawings to memorize things
this might irk some players but myst players should be used to that already
the original myst even came with a notebook but such luxury is long gone by the myst iii box contains only the cds
two lettersized sheets of paper should be enough to play myst iiiits been a long time since i met with atrus again
i was really excited to get my hands on myst  the only problem is waiting for a patch so i can play the game
if you go to the myst  website you will see the patches available to you
either  or  i had to download  and play in software mode
the software mode didnt run slow at all
it was beautiful and smooth
the graphics were outstanding and funnot only to watch but to actually be a part of
the sounds were crisp and realistic and the villianwow what a nut case
because i played myst and riven working my way around the worlds was almost familiar but not so to where i could solve the puzzles too easily
i was glad to be back
andso glad i was patient enough to download the patch
it is well worth it and a perfect addition to my top adventure pc games
i wish it didnt end
i will miss itjust may play it again
hope there is a fourth
anyone knowdid you ever wonder what happened to the worlds sirrus and achenar destroyed
nows your chance to find out
a fine game and a good continuation of the series by different people
expect the same kind of puzzles worlds and solutions but with a better interface and some excellent writing and acting
not nearly as difficult as either myst or riven but thats not necessarily a bad thingi finished this game not too long ago
in this myst game there are six ages although only five of them have puzzles
for those of you who have never played a myst game and if thats the case then you might want to play the other two or at least read the books an age is a world that you can get to through a special book
books that can take you to ages have a panel in them that has a picture of that world  if those books no longer work then that panel is black
the game begins in tomahna which from what i got to see of it is pretty enough that i found myself wishing i could look at more of it
you get to talk to atrus a bit in tomahna before the two of you are interrupted by a man who steals atrus newest book which links to releeshan
this is not good because this book is intended to be the new home of the dni people who we first found out about in the second myst game riven
atrus is unable to follow the man so you follow him instead and are taken to a learning age
while there you will have to collect information that will help you in the other ages you visit
three of these other ages can be visited in any order you wish while the fourth one can only be visited after youve learned all you need to know in the other ages
in the process of learning things about the various ages you also learn about the man who stole atrus book and why he hates atrus so muchfirst the graphics
all the ages are lovely so much so that i eventually got used to it
occaisionally there were things that i saw that really grabbed my attention but it was only when i first started playing that everything was amazing to me
it all looks great and you can pan  degrees around looking at everything
the only things that were a bit iffy were the people themselves
as usual with the myst games you dont get to see many people but there are a few in this game
by themselves the people look fine but when you take them in with the background they look a bit matted on
i dont know what it is maybe they dont have the right shading and shadows or something but they dont always look like theyre a part of their environmentlooking at the background is fine enough but im really starting to want to play with more things in the different evironments
i think riven was the best of the three myst games at this
there were a lot of objects around that you could both look at and play with
myst iii does have several objects that you can do things with but it didnt feel like there were enough of them
there were lots of beautiful worlds but it felt almost like being in an expensive glass store where you can look but not touchnow the puzzles
for the most part i really liked them
it was usually possible to figure out what you were supposed to do without having to make godlike leaps of logic
also when you did something correctly there was usually although not always some sort of immediate indication of that
that helped with my frusteration levels a bit because the there wasnt as much of a likelihood that i would do something correctly and not realize i could go on to some other puzzle
in each age there were puzzles that were pathetically easy and puzzles that drove me crazy but i usually felt like it was possible to solve them
there are no timed puzzles and no puzzles where you are forced to compete against the computer which is very nicethe story such as it was was interesting enough
this is not one of those games that plays like a movie with interactive puzzles
there are several possible ways to end the game all of which depend on your choices just before the game ends
before that dont worry theres really no way you can mess up and find yourself stuck without any way to go forward in the game
the only part of the game that is for me really replayable is the enddefinitely worth buying if you like adventure games
some of the game might go over your head if you arent familiar with the myst games youll probably be asking yourself you atrus is or who the dni are but i still think it would be an enjoyable gamegeneralsummary while i havent yet finished the game i have gotten a good taste of this games brilliance
the graphics are quite beautiful and the full d view grants a realism that previous myst titles lacked
the story intrigues the puzzles puzzle and the game simply emits a wondrous atmosphere
myst iii tends towards what true gaming should entail detailed visuals subtle and accurate sound intelligence and a welldeveloped narrativegameplay the gameplay is quite simple and rightly so
myst iii revoles around the point and click method of gaming
the game attempts to alleviate the potential boredom of wandering around in circles by allowing the user to remove the pretty fade inout screen transitions and quotzip modequot to sections of a given area quickly
bear in mind however stopping to at least look at the roses is a large part of the experience of this and many other adventure gamesmy only complaint is that the mouse doesnt tell the user where the user cant go on say an island
this may sound like a strange grievance but id like to know the places i cant go so i dont waste my time clicking all over the screenwhen im stuck on a puzzlein search of a place i havent yet exploredgraphics the lighting is marvelous the colors are vibrant and the exquisite detail is truly wonderful to beholdsound i enjoy subtle ambient music and effects
the musics frequency of play can be adjusted to accomodate the user
overall the sound is excellentim one of those gamers that has the walkthrough handy
i play as much for the graphics sounds and effects as anything so dont mind the quotfollow the leaderquot approach sometimes
that said this rd installment in the series is great
superior graphics several different endings i think i counted  and one seriously demented annoying character that taunts throughout the game from world to world room to room and so on
gets to the point where i wanted to shove one of the linking books down his throat
alas that was not an optionthe worlds were really great
least favorite the junglenature one
the coolest energy  lots of toys
my girlfreind like the jungle pretty flowers and cute animals  gimmie the giant turbo and antigravity anydayyoull enjoy it
get a walkthrough and see the different endings  its worth ita worthy sequel to the mystriven saga
the graphics are less crispclear than rivens but this is widely compensated by the possibility to rotate freely at each node
the puzzles well yes are on the easy side but in my opinion theyre far from trivial
maybe exile has a shorter gameplay than riven but i found riven a wonderful slideshow with annoying frustrating unbearable puzzles exile is much more coherent and i would like to say understandable
great creative work in the design of the ages as in myst as in riven the real pleasure was to slowly explore and wander in the wonderful worlds of the ages amateria is unbelievable
excellent immersive music with a strong ethnic flavour
two complaints brad dourif is an original bizarre talent but here hes surely overacting
second and major complaint exile as riven is a word of rocks sea rusty mechanisms sun
where are the mellow hues the quotmysteryquot of myst
where is the wonderful atmosphere of selenitic age
presto has done an excellent job
i hope that myst  will in some way return to the quotoriginalquot magic of mystok the graphics are absolutely stunning but that they were already in riven
the only real apparent technical progress and not the least mind you is the  degree view which lets you immerse into the breathtaking sceneries of six or more acurately five and a half different agesthe puzzles are in the same logical vein as usual but sadly i didnt find them very challenging and i was able to finish the game in approximately  hours which is much less than what i was expecting from the creators of the myst seriesas a whole exile is a wonderful game mysterious and beautiful and the music sends you directly into another totally magical dimension but if youve already played its prequels no doubt youll be left begging for more
my guess is that people with less experience in the myst universe will enjoy it much more
i can only recommend they play myst and riven in this order tooadventure gamers seem to be divided into those who love myst and those who hate it
im one of the former  myst was what got me hooked on adventure games in the first placethat being said i was really looking forward to exile for about a year before it came out and i got it as soon as i could
and i liked it
it was just as absorbing as myst and riven the ages were beautiful and the music was great
i love the concept and the interface is easy to understand and usei had some problems getting the game to run however
the movies never did run smoothly and a lot of the audio was messed up
i understand theres a patch for this now howeveri also found the puzzles extremely easy so the game didnt last very long
however even though they were easy the puzzles were more than just the quotapply inventory item x to slot qquot variety which i find tedious
you really do have to think and think in unaccustomed ways to get through thema good addition to the seriesi love the game
it looks great and plays great
i still would like to see better body damage and better chash aimy favorite type of game is simulation and when i saw this one i got it
i comes with three great sims
caesar pharaoh and the pharaoh expansion
all three games are great and here is a little info of eachfirst caesar iii the sequal to caesar ii
rule a roman empire
obey the gods and you recieve blessings dont and face certain doom
treat your plebs build houses forts walls granarys and water systems
fight distant enemies with your legions
gain a good reputation and achieve emperor status
will your empire crumble are succeed
you decide be an emperor the the gods will loke up topharaoh is the game coming after caesar iii
it has the same game fell as caesar but instead of rome you control egypt
train egyption armies to fight enemies
get food by fishing growing reeds in the nile and sending hunters to fetch food
obey the gods and build monuments that will stand for ages
manufacture goods to ship across and the lands and make moneyfinally the expansion extends the gameplay for pharaoh a lot farther
you can make more goods like paint and oil and also construct larger monments like tombs and pyrimidsoverall i like these games a lot but the reason i gave  stars is because the more things you make the slower the game gets
sometimes you can make so many buildings that it runs out of memory and the game freezes
but if you like sims get thisand by the title i mean the dark forces series
this game was a much anticipated gem back in the mid s
many of us had gotten weary of the many doom addons in circulation via some of the now very antiquated websites
some doom addon authors went ahead and created star wars doom essentially the doom game with star wars graphics and sprites added to replace the demons from hell running amuck on mars and earth
but like all user efforts it wasnt truly completed until years and years later and even then it seemed mediocre like a lot of user effortsthen one day at frys i see what has to be a mirage i see something like doom running on a pc only with the very cool trappings of star wars
it was of course the dark forces demo running on a then very state of the art pentium
like all good scifi and star wars fans i was hooked
i played the demo again and again and again and preordered the game from the old lucasgames cataloglike the official reviews have stated dark forces is a great triumph but is held back from being a truly spectacular game for the time
first off there was no in game save
if you died you had to start from a way point
if you lost off of your lives then you had to restart the mapthe story tells of a new imperial weapon meant to bring the rebel alliance to its knees and you play kyle katarn gun for hire to investigate and bring an end to this new threat
the level design ranges from outstanding to soso
simply put some of the maps are very interesting while repetitive while others are rather plain
all in all the design is linear unlike the doom mapsone of the real highlights of this game were the sound effects and general star wars space opera flavor
but even that only carries so far for a game whose structure is limited to about a dozen or so different missions
to counter that are all the user made addon levels created for the game
the old america online dark forces community is probably long since gone but they pioneered creating new maps for this game
most of which are preserved at dfnetthe addon levels added a whole new dimension to the game and expanded the basic game play by leaps and bounds
terrific and innovative architecture and story telling as well as new models and textures were found in these addon maps
so once you were done with the basic game you could go and see what other dark forces fans had made down load the maps and continue your experience
there were some real gems too  of which were made by single authors
some are multilevel stories made by a group of four or five designers teaming up for an effort but the supermajority of addons for this game were done by individualsmy other critique of the game is that some of the maps themselves seemed to be somewhat limiting in terms of atmosphere
an example is the nar shadaa map
where new textures to create buildings would have been helpful instead what we get are crates stacked up on top of one another to emulate a down town feel for a section of the mapall in all it was a very fun game to play at the time though by todays standards its rather dated
an interesting effort happened a few years back where some of the authors of addon maps for the latest star wars games took some of the dark forces levels and remade them with modern graphics for the jedi outcast series
if youre a true star wars gamer then it may be worth your time to check out both this game and some of the addons i mentioned in this reviewhave funmany frown at the idea of oldschool fps games
wolfenstein d doom duke nukemthey all were great for their time and are still good but they just havent aged very well
star wars dark forces however has not lost as much of its punch in the  years that have passedstorythe story of kyle katarn is actually one of the better stories that star wars games have put out
hes not the jedi badass from the jedi knight games by the way those are all purchaseworthy
 but he does have a gruff attitude
i dont think nostalgia is the reason for my interest in this story
boba fett darth vader jabba the hutt and an imperial commander sorry cant remember the name make appearances in this chapter where the advanced dark troopers obliterate planets
kyle katarn and partner jan ors are paid to eliminate this threat
its not shakespeare but instead of going the for the campy senseofhumor that rogue squadron and other star wars flightcombat games go forthis one is dark and serious
its not heartfelt drama but it does have a gripping tone to itgraphicsthe graphics of course are outdated what games from  years ago isnt
however i still felt comfortable with the levels environments because they are colorful and imaginative
an icy terrain hides a factory underneaththe shadows of some sewers hide unfriendly creatures underneatha seemingly empty room reveals a  soldiers ready to blast you
the graphics arent terrific but they dont hurt your eyes and you can still appreciate the craftiness from back in the daysoundthe music is in midi format but it is excellent music
there are  tracks that are used for  levels each plus  more for the intense final stages
the weapons all sound like intimidating pieces of machinery
youll get a sadistic chuckle when a petty officer proclaims youre not authorized to be in this area
 but your grenade says otherwise
the voiceacting is also good but there arent too many cutscenes to prove that
but what you get is topnotch as lucasarts always did back thencontrolsyou can customize the keyboard functions however you want or you can use a mouse andor joystick
its all up to you
there are only basic features such as jumping this really was a breakthrough back then crouching using switches and opening doors
theres not much room for confusiongameplaythe level design is still pretty good because the game doesnt get carried away with hundreds of hallways and doors just to find one key
you will traverse  levels that large yesbut with a map function and some colorful visuals you wont feel frustrated
about the key business youll still be doing it but with plenty of stormtroopers to eliminate and  weapons to do it
the puzzles in this game arent necessarily hard but there are some brainscramblers
although this is nice because the game doesnt hold your hand there are a few puzzles that seem to come out of nowhere
its nice to know that the game is a little challenging but the game doesnt make it clear whether you have a puzzle in front of you or whether its just a piece of colorful scenery
that does take its toll on a few occassion
but with the smart ai err toughtheres not much strategy here and star wars feelthis fps stands out above other shooters from the pastthis game is fun but is a little outdated and has been outdone by countless games
but it still a lot of fun
the  levels are all fun and with some bosses thrown in who can be a real painintheass dark forces is worthy trip down memory lanerebel assault  the sequel to the extreamly popular origianal is here so how does it fair up
overall it fares up really well but its ultimatly too short
rebel assault s plot is really interesting with rookie one trying to stop the evil empire from unleashing a wave of phantom ships that can attack and destroy at will without being spotted
this is of course very bad and throughout your travels to stop this menace you will fly through asteroid fields zoom on a speeder bike through a forest go on a really big star destroyer and infiltrate a secret base
the graphics are very good although they are a little rough here and there
the full motion sequences are extreamly good with fine voice acting
the music is also very good
my favorite part is all the hidden easter eggs hidden in the game which include a willie coyote spoof dancing stormtroopers and a hillarious mystery science theater  mode
however this game is too short on easy mode if you skip all the movies you can beat it in less then  minutes
but its still a good gamethe good great plot music varitey and graphics hilarious easter eggsthe bad too short gets really hard on difficulty levels graphics can be choopyand the ugly bad endingi picked up this game back in the s and was blown away by the cinematics and gameplay
i remember how much fun it was to blow away imperials and then be rewarded with a cutscene showing darth vader choking someone
it brought back memories of the original trilogy and i like how lucasarts deviated from the original trilogy to bring us a storyline that was original and compelling
i would say that the story is similar to that of dark forces in which you are in the star wars universe but not directly in the main story of the movies
i like how you can play the story through and it is just like being in a movie with real people in the cinematics
to me this is the best part of the game when you actually get to be involvedthe game is short but in my mind the story sells it
the graphics are dated now but the cinematics still blow away many of the other games that were made at the time save wing commander  and   if you are an avid star wars fan this is a must own game
if you are looking for complexity this game isnt too hard and you might be disappointed
if you are looking for the cinematic game experience this is the game for youvery good simulation star wars gamewhich started alot of  it all
so what it is d who cares
its the gameplay and great story line that matters within this game and i reccomend it for any star wars gameras i said in the title although this is a good game it is a bit dated by todays standards but when it first came out it was top of the line and set some of the standards modern flight games usethe gameplay is pretty simple you fly as an alliance pilot against the empire on various types of missions with a variety of craft
you get to fly everything x y b and a wings which are all good quality ships each having its own design intention
the ywing is a bomber while the awing is more of a reconinterception craft that sort of thingthe missions are strictly space orientated no planetary battles whatsoeverlike rogue squadron on n but i have no complaints about that it is star wars after all
in general i found the missions entertaining and realistic but the trouble was if your ship was destroyed you had something like a  chance of getting caught by the empire and if you were caught you would be stripped of rank and points if you tried to reviverestore your characterthe gameplay also lags seriously in some places
when targetting you cant see what the enemy craft is doing nor can you get an accurate hullshield damage assessment which is present in future versions but the lackthereof makes this game harder to play
the lasers are also incredibly inaccurate particularly on the xwing which is what you fly most of the time
its hard to explain but you have to move your ship to obtain a laser lock depending on which side your lasers are firing from which isreally annoyinggraphically speaking the game is nothing fancy it incorporates the sort of squarish chunky graphics of the prepentium era
this particularly shows during the mission briefing scenes when the mouth of the briefing officer keeps moving even after hes stopped talking thats funnysound wise the game is good though it might benefit from a soundtrack here and there but the sound effects are goodthis game is a classic good in its day but now it is old and dilipated xwing vs tie fighter or just tie fighter beats this game
my advice dont waste your money on it unless youre a real sw fan or flight sim game fan theres a lot of better stuff out therea prelude to the greatest pc game ever released grim fandangofull throttle is a piece of the tim schafer puzzle
he creates a world that commands our attention and delights us with humor that allows us to escape our ordinary liveswhile the game is dated it is also next to impossible to find
this is a game for tim schafer fans and collectorstherefore this my review of a recently purchased new copy from amazon
the amazon seller broke up a lucas arts  collection set and sold me one of the discs from the rd volume
the full throttle game was paired with dark forces from  star wars  while the installation for both games was on another disc unsent from the setthe disc was clearly marked in large type not for individual  sale
i notified lucas and they identified the disc and confirmed that the disc sold to me was from their rd  classic collection and that the game installation was on another disc from that particular set
the seller described the disc as a jewel case cardboard sleeve sealed by the manufactureri notified amazon they refunded my money
amazon is wonderfulbut the  approval rated seller is selling the same individual disks from the same sets without the installation diskstill here at amazon two months laterfull throttle is a collectors item and very hard to find in new condition
there was an updated version released in europeengland in  and it is now considered next to impossible to find especially for us here in the usabe very careful about a reasonable purchase or even  an unreasonable purchase of this game
the vultures are circling around it
be carefulthe game is a windows  xp players can limp along with xps compatibility mode for windows  or follow one of the many work arounds offered by fans at various websitesi dont know what happened between lucas arts and tim schafer but it appears even though there is a market for the lucas games by schafer lucas is not going to update the games platform nor produce any more to sellat this point in time january   this is not a casual game to buy
it is rare and expensive
if you are a purchasing a copy for a reasonable amount more than likely you are not purchasing a valid playable copyi would hate to unfairly target other sellers at amazon for this game but unless you can verify the games authenticity dont buy itonly buy this game if you are a fan and want the evolutionary  works of the wildest and smartest game developer in historymjhi remember playing this game so long ago when it first came out  years ago
i loved the story the hardrock music the sarcastic lucasarts humor and the interactivity of the puzzles
yes this is a simple pointandclick adventure but while the process is simplethe way the game unfolds and presents the resulting cutscenes is very impressive
full throttle is more of an interactive movie than an actual game but thats actually a compliment because interactive movies dont get much betterso why not a star rating
well this game is simply too short and over before way before you might want
games didnt have the hour length of todays titles back then but there were ones longer than this hour adventure back in the day tooincluding lucasarts own star wars games
if you dont use a guide the puzzles can be pretty headscratching
but like all puzzle games the second time around just isnt the same because the solutions dont change
for a low price of  bucks or lower you will have a blast the first time through
the second time around youll enjoy the storybut when you can finish it in  hours instead of  the suspense feels rushedall because youve passed the test oncemy love for full throttle isnt only nostalgic  i had the same criticisms  years ago
however i still have the same praise i had in  too
i highly recommend full throttle to any gamer but just be aware of its short length before you buy itrock on
game ontired of seeing imperial tie fighters drop like flies against a target as slow and vulnerable as a patchedup correlian freighter
than this game is for you
the original tie fighter was a sequel to the original xwing fighter game  both have been updated for win  and  with better sound and graphics in the flight sequences
between the flying however the graphics on each look like a throwback to the games era ancestor  with still characters and midi music stereo sound is available during flights so anybody who needs an excuse to hear that john williams music should get either game
since the collectors ed
of each game is strongly rooted to the earlier games and with the original tie fighter having been the better title the new tie fighter collectors ed
beats the xwce
besides the better and more believable interiors of the imperial craft  the target computer in tf shows the ship and what direction its pointing relative to you is a better story
here you not only fight for the empire hows that for a switch but for its inner circle as well
most of the time the interests run in the same direction as the high command  now you have to investigate ships that your commanders want you to destroy and you may find yourself getting shot at by some of your fellow tie pilots
even the obstacle course is better  with the complex tunnels and moving doors reminding me muc of the death star run from jedi
you start out flying the simple basic tie fighter no shields and no hyperdrive working your way up to the tie interceptor and up to the tie advanced
not of all of your missions pit you against the rebellion  instead youll spend more time fighting pirates or against both sides in civil wars you need the empires permission to war against anybody or against imperial defectors complete with their own star destroyer and squadrons of the latest in tf technology
a complex storyline will have you saving the empire from a coup and even flying alongside darth vader himself if you screw that mission youll have to apologize in personstoryline and graphics aside tf suffers for much of the same reason as xw  canned missions that have you blasting away at just about everybody can get pretty repetitive
youre the weak link  there are a few set mission goals and if any are missed the mission is a failure youd think with their fleets of cruisers and their clouds of fighters the empire could afford to miss a few hundred
also the xwtf series has been advanced in meaningful but slow steps  with the collectors ed being a great facelift for the older games but not a great improvement on them
if youve got at least an old p mmx with a decent d card i had the voodoo you should make the jump to the xwing v tie fighter making sure that your version comes with the balance of power campaign
xwvtf was geared for multiplayer but supported it poorly
nevertheless singleplay is always going to a problem for scriptedmission games like these and the newer games have somewhat better graphics and sound
if youre running a p id suggest going up a notch to xwing alliance
the collectors edition of either of the first two games is strongly recommended for those whose systems top out below mhzits what i said it even has the intense training which you spend forever doing
i spent a good time playing it but i stopped because i didnt feel like beating out all the rival schools
i had trouble with the controls and ended up blocking like crazy because i couldnt manuever
if you could feel pain it would be hard to tell the differnce between this game and the actual thing
although the real swords would killthis game is ok  its not as good as bushido blade so ive heard
now there are life meters again
i really havent played it much i just rented it and zoe and i spent most my time with zoe
i think its a good game though
but when you play in the dojos most of the times you use bokkens which are the wooden swordslike other reviewers i found the strategy and elegance of this game compelling
at first it was difficult  so much so i gave it up for months
when i had more time i returned to the game  and within a week i mastered well i should be more humble grasped the controls
kengo is nice because it requires you to really watch your opponent instead of barraging him with everything you got
at first i had to do this to advance  but once i reached a certain comfort with the game pacing i realized i could allow my opponent time to recover and strike againthis is a game i think that you can play for a long time  slowly coming to terms with the user interface and matching its rhythm  instead over overwhelming it with your nervous systemlittle things in the game like the types of training are yes relaxing
its amazing to see a game that actually relaxes you
the japanese culture one experiences from the game is marvellous  i only wish that they gave the various teachers of the schools more personality instead of having them say the same lines with different voice acting
definitely a good game to pick up and have in your libraryi love kengo master of bushido
i dont have a katana but i bought a boken immediately
the game basically takes a bit
i had fun in sort of imagining my own story linethe fighting is the whole game
it is extremely fun though
i won the tournament but the game still wasnt over
it can go on for a long time
you can train or fight other men
you also fight other schools for their swords and techniques
i started out in the thrusting school and grew to love it like it was my homethere are tons of different moves and combos
you can customize your own combos
they are really easy to pull off and you always know it hurt the other guybasically the game is fun though
i chose a guy and made up my own story
katanas can only be used during tournament play or when you kill a master
but the game is extremely fun still
i really wish i could find a copy though
if you can hold on to this rare gemit is a shame the dreamcast had to die so early in its life because it was a home to truly original games like this one that were a real treat to play
this game is just segas the house of the dead  also released for dreamcast but instead of using a lightgun peripheral you use a keyboard to type words and phrases that appear on screen as zombies and the undead try to attack you
it is actually a lot of fun and its only real flaw is that your wrists will be in graet pain after playing this game for a good period of time
still if you own a dreamcast these kinds of games are what made it one of the greatest systems no matter how long its life wasthe movies in this game were great
unfortunately the game consists almost entirely of them
the first time through this game was pretty cool but it doesnt have a lot of replay value
you can rent this and have plenty of time to master it
thats what i didtheres no denying it the bouncers story mode is relatively short and leaves something to be desired
but theres more to the game than that
once youve gone through the story with all three main characters youve unlocked a ton of fighters to use in the vs and survival modes
there are over  unique characters in all that isnt counting the multiple mugetsu and dauragon reskins
they each have loads of moves and the system is truly fresh and fun it utilizes the dualshocks analog buttons
pressing an attack button soft or hard will activate different attacks
it took a little getting used to but soon it felt completely natural
it was great fun to figure out as many various combos as i couldthe battles in story mode are usually pretty brief and they seem even more so when sandwiched between two long cut scenes
if you want long battles go into vs mode
if you dont have anyone to play against thats ok because the enemy ai in this game is incredible
many times ive had a single round in a way brawl last well over five minutes before a winner is finally declared
i had to set the timer to infinite because there is no victor if the time runs out before there is a last man standing
 seconds just isnt enough in a good way
theres a staggering number of different character combinations you can put into a battle
if way is too much for you you can configure it to way
and if you set it to on youve got a traditional fighting game that easily holds its own against tekken doa tobal etc
of course you get the usual alternate costumes for each character i think they all have at least four and selectable locations
story mode is fun a few times but to me the real meat of the bouncer is the vs mode
i can already tell that ill be playing this for years to come
take it from a seasoned tekkentobal veteran there is a lot of excellent fighting to be done in the bouncer even long after youve finished story modei thought this was a very good game but it was just really short
it has tons of replay value and you need to play it a minimmum of six times to finish it
multiple characters and a huge multiplayer mode will keep most interested for a long time
the best graphics on ps they are better than final fantasy x overall it is a very good game that is rich in actioni should start out with saying that this game is not a traditional game from squaresoft it is like a jazzed up version of streets of rage or something
it has many good things about it and many bad thingsfirst off graphics are amazing and dialog sounds different instead of having that robotic sound to it
by all means this is a great game its got story its pretty fun and it has the hugest replay value of any game everhowever the game is extremely short about an hour or two depending if you skip movies or not
and after beating the game a few times the only fun thing to do is battle it out with a few of your freinds
i would like to have seen more rpg elements in this game instead of movies then fightingif you want to showoff your playstation  or you have some freinds to fight with then this game is for you
however if you are more of an rpger and not much for just battle games then just rent the game firstthis is an excellent looking game probably the best looking game on the ps right now
but there is one major flaw to this game its way to short
if you skip all the cinematics then you could probably beat it in less than an hour
but it has tons of replay value and the cinematics are unbelivable
if you like fighting games and good graphics buy this gamethis game is a lot of fun
i admit that it is not all that long of a game but that is ok the graphics are awsome using the dvdrom feature of your ps to give you such good grapics and cut scenes
if you like fighting games then you should get this oneyou know this company makes rpg games so if thats what you want get a final fantasy or something
but if you are like me and want a break from the usual get this game as it is a beat em up style game that seems to be lacking after the psx era of time
and if you think final fight street wise may be a good idea steer clear of that heap of garbage and get this game instead
this has the good but kind of blurry graphics that were awesome at the time and the cg cutscenes are still very impressive to this day
the downfall in my opinion is the cheap fighting people can do in this game it is broken
kou can do consecutive uppercuts if you time them right and the first form of duragon has a knee combo if done right you will kill the guard and your foe to easily
get all the characters and play the game to see for yourself that it is a good change for a while and then you see how much bs can actually be found in the fighting engine
if you are the throw the controller type do not get this gamethis is a really fun game if not a little short
you get attached to your characters and it has ok replay valuegraphics  ive never seen better on a ps game
movie and game graphics alikesound everyones voice acted really well except for the main character but he gets better as you go alongstory
they turn a simple story into a complex one with this gamereplay
you can play arcade  player or a weird  on  thing
or the story the replay is better than everyone sayscut cinemas thats what this game is
movies
and at the end of the beginning movie when he hits the stairs and then the bouncer logo comes on the screen
damn thats sweetoverall fun  its a big movie and you can play in the battles
i think its great but if you dont have the patience to wait through lots of movies then theres almost no point in buying this gamei really like this product
as a licensed pilot this item gives a more realistic civilian pc flying experience then any joystick can
and for the price it cant be beat
sure there are other yokes costing a lot more but unless you want to build a pc simulator you can log real time in why bothermy reason for  instead of  stars
the clamps are awful
they are designed only to fit really thick flat desks
if your computer desk has a curved front its really difficult to get this to stay putthe feel of the yoke is a little too plasticky
i would like to see slightly smaller yoke with a closer material feel to a real yokethis item is a must have for anyone who takes their civilian flight simulators  micrsoft flight sim xplanefly
seriously
its so much more enjoyable and realistic then using a joystick
unless you have airbus simulator addonsgreatly enhances fs  play
sticks just a little so you dont know if youre exactly at center and its tough make fine adjustments to your flight
otherwise a solid productfor a first goround with the ps this is not a bad baseball game
first the good the graphics and presentation are as good as any ps game
realistically there is no way to make all  active players look unique
the player models and stadiums look great and the animation is fluid
 the sound is for the most part dead on
the commentary keeps pace and is crisp and the heckles from the fans usually works though why do my own fans heckle when i get calls for me
 the controls work real well
the pitcher interface allows greater control of speed and placement and correctly the pitcher loses control as he tires
the batter interface allows more control of hitting placement
 the computer ai actually tries to win
when pitching you need to mix up pitches speed and placement or the computer will tee off on you
on the bases the computer is very agressive
pitching the computer seems to adapt one time i homered off a outside low pitch and the next at bat i saw only inside stuffthe bad  get rid of the fascination with homers i know chicks dig the long ball but when rey ordonez goes deep twice thats too much
 wheres the stattracking baseball is the sport most in love with stats yet there is only about  relevant stats
and why arent they presented ingame id like to see something like quotis slugging  over his last  gamesquot
the single vantage relpay is badbasically it is of no usei really liked this game
its true this game is pretty easy once you get used to it
you can hit up to  home runs in a  inning rookie game but not always
so what if this game is easy its still tons of fun
its true its unrealistic but not to unrealistic
its like nfl blitz easy but fun
what i really enjoy is hitting homeruns which is really cool and trying to throw no hitters with my pitchers
i finally got tired of this game after about playing  seasons of  games  playoffs and bunus games
but i started playing it again when the baseball season started
so overall this game is tons of fun and i enjoyed it a lot
i would reccomend buying a used versioni have problems with what some of these other reviewers are saying
for one i would bet that these people are scoring all of these runs on rookie level
try it on allstar and it is much harder
and it is not almost impossible to strike out someone as another reviewer says you just have to know how to pitch
i must admit the fielding control is a little off
it is difficult to get to gappers in the outfield and i often throw the ball to the wrong base with the analog stick
also every hit is a grounder a hardliner or a fly ball
but this game has some of the best graphics ive seen on the players and the stadiums
on the higher levels this is a challenging game with great graphicsthis is a great game
although not as intuitive as the n version this is still a fun game
my only rant is that the story mode had no mario characters in it but its still a good title and is worthy for your gameboy color collectionthis game isnt as good as the nintendo game but its still quite good
mario tennis on the gameboy is till a good conversion and the realisim is very good
as with the  version when you beat other players you gain experience points which state where you will be placed in the rankings
there are several characters to choose from so there is bound to be one that you willbe able to manage
mario tennis is possibly the best tennis game on the gameboy but if you like tennis that much then i recommend that you buy the  version
or alternativly have both versions as you can download your data from the gameboy through the transfer packmario golf is my all time favourite game so when mario tennis came out i thought it would be really good
i was a bit dissapointed
this game is so well designed and so much fun to play
the only problem is that its so incredebly easy
there are about  matches you play throughout the whole game in singles and doubles and not only did i not lose a single match but out of the  plus games  games to a set  sets to a match i lost about  games all up
even when playing in the final tournament and when i played mario i didnt lose a single game
its actually possible that if i started playing the whole game again i could win  of all points
really fun gameplay earns this game pointsin this gbc version of mario tennisyou can do an exibitionmario touror play mini games wich you uncover when you do the make your own characterif you dont understand a word they use in tennis like volly for exampleyou can look it up in a dictionary they put in therein mario tour you pick if you want to be a boy or a girl and then you name it and you also name your doubles partneryou live in a dorm and you go to a tennis academyyou start off is juniorsthen seniorsand then your on the traveling teamin the exibition you can play singles or doublesyou pick what character you want and who you want to play against and their skill levelin the mini game modeyou get to play mini games that youve unlocked in mario tourthis is a fun game and i recomend it if you have a gbca little hard to play at first but ths game is fun and comes in very handy on a long flightso about two days before christmas i ordered this as well as a  gigabyte memory stick plus another game now the memory stick came first the following the other game but i have not got the product yet which is frustrating because i was not home when the mail man came so they didnt leave the package or a conformation slip which the usps web site said other wise i use to have this game and it is awesome in my opinion its like the same one on the ps
so this being said try not to use the postal service
if the postman is having a bad day they might decide not to leave a conformation slip
hope my game comes todaythis is the first game that i got for the psp
it was really fun and had good graphics but just like other atv game it gets boring after awhilewhen u beat it there is nothing else to do becides freeride and after u go to every place and explore it gets really boring
i found out later that it is the exact same game on the ps atv  and i got more bored of it after i got it for the ps
if i were u unless u really like it i would just buy it for the ps
it is a fun game but it gets boring after a while and if u had both of them for each system i would use cheats for the one that u bought seconedim having an absolute blast playing this game
its quite addicitive and all around a great game
i think most of the negative reviews of this game are false
i myself almost didnt by this game based on these reviews but i am sure glad i didnt listen to them
the gameplay is solid the atv controls are challenging but very realistic
i love how you can slide into turns and adjust the pitch of the atv in the air kind of like the real thing
there are tons of tracks to choose from ranging from superscroos style national enduro and stunt style
you can even purchase additional tracks with credits earned for winning races
there are tons of atvs you can purchase as well each with their own performance characteristics
you can customize your uniform helments etc
you can tweak your bikes shocks tires pipes etc i mean this game has it all
there are different modes to race too like a chapionship mode that is kind of like a career mode
it is in this mode where after winning you earn points which unlock new tracks and events
as far as the graphics are concerned i think they are great
the atvs themselves are not the nicest ive seen but they more than serve the purpose
the ai racers are also very challenging to beat the game is not that easy
anyone who is a fan of supercross or atvs or enjoyed playing motocross madness will absolutely love this game
you can pull off a lot of cool stunts and some serious air
this game is a winnerdecide for yourself on this onedont listen to the bogus reviews
update in response to a gamers reviewfirst of all i gave the game an overall of  starsbut since then i think it now deserves a  after continued play
this game is so much fun it didnt take me much time to think about what review to give itits an absolute blast to play once again ill will  endorse this game to anyone who comes my waydo not listen to these negative reviewersthis guy complains he cant stay on the track or perform any tricks and finds it annoying pleeeasseejust because you have your own personal issues with the game dont rate it based on your incompetence in playing ityes it does take practice to get good and is not easy but thats what makes this game challenging and funtry upgrading tires or suspension to get better control of your atvcertain tires perform better on certain types of trackspay attention to the tire ratingsalso i strongly disagree with this game being a rentalits replay value is excellenti find myself playing it against others online quite frequentlydont hesitate to buy this gameyou can thank me lateri think this game is exactly what it is supposed to be
a portable version of the ps atv offroad fury games
it takes a little getting used to with the psp but you get used to it after a few tracks
it is a little hard but so were the console versions
the more you play it the better you get
i dont agree with that review that said nobody plays this online cause the first day i got it which was about a week ago there were several games going on
this game like the console ones is very addictive and a good deal for  bucks
my only real problem with it is the load times
theyve got the longest loading times of any of my psp games
theyre especially long when you get in to it and wanna get to the next race
but that aside its definetely  a game to buy if you liked the ps versionsthis is a great game if you own a dreamcast the game has lost most of its features becuase its fantasy star online
most of the reviews on it are from  i would have given it a  star if i was playing it back in the day
iam not from the time period of the game
the graphics are good for a dreamcast game but compared too today  its really bad
i had a tough time playing it and made it to level  if you collect dreamcast games this would be a good one to get becuase many people will remember this game it can sell for  on adv
and dont pay anymore for itgood piece of history not easy for modern gamers to pick up and playhopefully this isnt the last review for the gameor my last reviewback when online play was only for rich kids i got the honor of playing this online at a friends house
at the time it bothered me that it required monthly online payments for online mode this has nothing to do with the rating itself it just kept me from going on and compared to internet nowadays dial up is a jokehowever back in the day if you were online with this you were riding pretty fat
im rating this based on how its held up  years later without online play  i heard that online play is still possible but im not smart enough to figure that all out
people who still purchase dreamcast games and other dated titles have a certain view and different appreciation for games than ones who jump on the newer titleswho knows maybe you appreciate both to each his own
the graphics in this game were good at the time and though game play was limited i got my moneys worth
not many good rpgs came out for dreamcast so id consider this and pt  one of the better ones
if you dont own skies of arcadia in my opinion the consoles best rpg id recommend saving up for for that on first
however if you want a decent extremely bargain rpg go for it
but beware you need the serial number of the particular game  mine was on the inside center piece of the case to even boot this upok when i got it i thought it would be an ok story  i turned it onstarted playing and i was hooked
but really get a keyboard i you want to chat
the only problems i have is that the game is the same thing over and over again and to save your game you have to quitpros the game is online controls are great lots o weapons you can build your own person builtin mail system creating teams hard bosses many leveles challengeing quests graphics special battel systemcons same thing over and over again if you dont have a keyboard its hard to chat if the dc shuts down before you disconect your weapons and  will be erasedthat is about it but it is a great get the game it is fun and amazingpso is awesome
i love this game
i must admit it presents a good challenge something most rpgs cant deliver
graphically its beautiful it has an incredible soundtrack i like the real time combat detailed enemies not just the same  monsters remade with different colors like most other games and its star wars era based time and place makes it original and a huge success
plus all the character options you have make it replayable time and time again
this is definitely one of the best for sega ever just like its predecessors
i recommend you buy this right awaysince buying the dreamcast it had never been played as much as my pc did until sonic team announced the production of a sequel to one or thee most popular role playing games ever to hit the sega system
phantasy star first was born and released on the sega master system its ability to use a three dimensional scenery as dungeons was astonishing for a  bit system
phantasy star  was then released for the sega genesis megadrive and was even better with its addictive game play and graphics made it a huge hit for everyone
phantasy star  amp  was repeated game play of the second of the series
sonic team has revived the saga and has released the long awaited and most anticipated gamephantasy star online psomeanwhile the game was being produced i never paid much attention into enquiring what the game was like graphics and game play wise so when i purchased the game it wasnt what i was expecting
however once i played it it definitely took a lot of shirt pulling to stop me playing the game as well as the money it was costing me when playing onlinegraphics sets the game to a stereotypical futuristic movie with all the hovering ships in the background makes the game absolutely great to play and even just to sit and view each element that moves
every element in the game is all d rendered which puts the systems graphics card into good use the character you are able to create can be unique in ever perspective as a wide array of clothing race and hairstyles are at your disposal
despite such amazing graphics expectations of the games frame rate to slow down is not common thus giving the gamer freedom to play the game at constant smoothgame play pso is played in a third person view like diablo on the pc which is what surprised me the most about the game
not like its predecessors of issuing commands to your characters to cast magic or attack you control your characters movement and hisher ability to strike or cast a spell on your foe which is also aided by a automated targeting system aiding the user to pick his foe off
a numerous amount of spells techniques as they are called in the game are collected throughout the game
user is able to set his controls as shortcuts for different spellsitemsattacks
lots of functions are there its a matter of setting it the way the user feels most comfortablelasting appealthe lasting appeal really does depend on two factorsrpg addictiveness if you are addicted to the game then you will play through the game in all difficulties like you are suppose to but in some cases defeating the boss and completing the game is the end for some gamers but it would be a waste of  if you stopped their and didnt play all the way throughonline capability this is the most important factor to the lasting appeal of the game
the online side to pso is merely and extension to the game which doesnt sound like much but believe meit is
the online community lets you communicate with other players all around the world and to also team up with  other players
whilst playing with others more enemies and more experience points are there for the taking
playing with others increases the gamers life span for the game though you are just doing a repetitive job online it is still a fun experience applause to sonic team for making it possibleside quest this will also refer to the online capabilities of the game
using the online features of the game you are able to download quests
doing this gives you an extra level to play through and a more challenging one not experienced on the features present within the game
with creators of quests the game may become more challengingrare searching personally im a hypocrite
reason being is that i asked the question why would i want to go searching for rare items
but i find myself now doing so
i spent much of my free time looking for rare itemsweapons that i sometimes look at the clock to find its well past my bedtime
giving you a sense of satisfaction of finding a rare makes you a proud gamer
rare items are what they arerare
some items that are under that title are time consummating to find eg
you can spend  hours playing the game and still not find it whereas some are more fortunate to find it than otherscons keyboard you will find yourself unable to become as able as other players in the game especially in online gaming due to not possessing a keyboard
the keyboard is a needed peripheral to the game in order to communicate
although identical to a standard pc keyboard it has a different port which i feel is a way to make people go out and buy more dreamcast accessoriesmemory card most people have already got a memory card but the game is so good you may want to create a second character to play with
unfortunatly the game will not allow you to save a second character onto the same memory card
a  megabyte memory card contains approximatly  pages page is its unit of data
a saved game along with a main file takes up  pages of data but it wont allow you to save a second game and many find this frustrating and they go out and pay for another memory cardconclusion  the game is very addictive
possibly the best game for the dreamcast as you will not find that youll have spent more time on another rpg than you will on this one
so far im into my th hour of the gameyes thats how addictive it is
you will be satisfied with the purchase of this game guarenteed
if you do not have a dreamcast buy one second hand if your on a budget and get phantasy star onlinetrust me you will not be the only one
many people i know have done so and they dont regret it for a secondid have gave the game a  out of  except the only part that brings the point down is the cons sectionmainly the memory card section and the keyboard though you are bound to buy more games which need these peripherals anyway so its no big loss unless you only plan on buying a selected amount of titles for the consolei would first like to point out this is an online game
you will sadly be dissapointed if u are buying it for its offline mode
the online mode is also diablo style with players creating quotteamsquot and then joining the teams with a max number of  players
this isnt a constant world a la ultima online or everquestthe graphics in this game are gorgeous
the colors are lush and the textures are detailed
there are some moments when u notice the texture smoothing right in front of your feet but its not a big deal
each monster is detailed incredibly and the lighting gives each battle and level its own effect
the bosses are amazing and huge
get ready for some epic battles especially with friends
the first time you beat dark fallz online with  other people is amazing and you feel youve accomplished something
the characters are also designed really well and are customizable but limited
you can change the face color of the outfit hair proportion heightweight and name
i will say that the limitations of each class hunter ranger force kept me creating character after character not really feeling comfortable with onegameplay wise the game is very simple
there are only  major areas ranging from  levels deep
it might seem long at first but it ends up being fairly short
controls are fully customizable and lets you choose a button for healing fighting magic etc
they dont take long to master
the game is challenging and even at high levels you can play hard and very hard which raises the bar giving more exp and better items
once youve played through you might find yourself getting bored
luckily the online play keeps it fresh with the group aspect
also have a keyboard
i dont and its a hassle to converse and ask simple things onlinesound is simply and mainly consists of an electronic soft sound
swords make a light sabre sound and other weapons make the same except guns
the music could use a little work as it gets really irritating after a while though this isnt a huge problemoverall this is a very decent game
its fun to work on your characters and build your levels
fighting your way through dungeons with friends cant be beat
this is phantasy star online not offline
make sure you have internet plug in the phone cord and sign on
this game is awesome and if you like diablo style games this is definitly for you
old school phantasy star fans shouldnt be looking for the classic rpg elements
this is an action hack n slash
the story is also nonexistent
enjoy this game for what it is a fun action online game
you wont be dissapointedicewind dale heart of winter takes place in a frosty climate in a harsh terrain separated from the rest of the world by the mountain range known as the spine of the world
the slowly unraveling plot revolves around the resurrected corpse of an ancient king possessed by some unseen force that gathers the barbarian tribes into a fearsome army
interaction with a wide variety of npcs each with unique motivations keeps the story flowingthe game starts slowly with creation of six characters from scratch using standard secondedition add race and class combinations
its a laborious process requiring attribute assignment as well as redistribution of points
while the customization possibilities are varied character creation is six times longer for six distinct charactersfurther customization includes a choice of weapon skills portraits and even character voices
the assumption is made that youre familiar with the add game and its a tradeoff of customization versus playability
the character customization feature cant be underestimated in terms of enjoyment for players who take care with their characters biography portrait and color schemecombat is not the first action your characters perform a welcome relief from similar games
heart of winters plot advancement requires taking the time to talk to a wide variety of npcs
the interaction is rewarding in its own right as characters can actually gain experience through successfully uniting a family uncovering a lie or finding out a bit of lore
the party wanders around for quite some time before traveling off to the barbarian lands where the action really heats upheart of winter like icewind dale and baldurs gate is dungeons  dragons with all the irritating flaws removed
bards have actual songs they can use spells are represented by easily recognizable icons memorization and spell casting are a snap thieves pick pockets clerics cast spells and wizards even specialize
dualclass multiclass and weapon specialization are all included in the game to good effectexploration in heart of winter uses an interface that seems better suited to realtime strategy games
each area lies shrouded in a fog of war until characters pass through and reveal the terrain
even though the game still runs in x resolution the large prerendered backgrounds have exceptional detail
random weather effects add to the impressive and engaging environmentalignment and attributes matter too
characters with various charisma attributes and distinct alignments garner different responses from npcs while some actions reinforce a good characters nature
killing townspeople is an abominable act which speaks for itself and has serious repercussions on character interaction
as for characters you pick a voice for each and they all recite their lines on cue
its very entertaining for example when a surly female gets annoyed and husks yes what is it
or a snickering thief mutters what now
even more amusing are the phrases the characters utter when they die
combat is positively lethal if not impossible without intermittent pausing
trying to distinguish a character from the enemy can be extremely difficult especially in the chaos of combat
nevertheless the spell effects are magnificent as characters chant ancient spells with magical effects blasting across the screenother flaws include a miserable path finding function often requiring repeated clicks to enter a dwelling or when the party grinds to a halt if the leader gets stuck behind a stool
a potentially fatal flaw is the possibility of accidentally killing a character that is integral to the plot which can effectively ruin the game
ultimately the story makes the game albeit with interspersed and occasionally annoying action sequences
but each combat has a purpose which makes gameplay challenging and rewardingstill having problems with this game
it gives all the amenities for articles but still cant get it to go to other area
waiting til i finish regular part of game to try that avenueall right i will readily admit along with a million others that this game is too short
wait there dont stop reading
im not done yet
first of all i would like to point out that this is an expansion which means it continues a larger game
that it does well and should add just as much game time as the bg expansion tales of the sword coast
additionally there are some new nifty features that should get any iwd fans attention
the first and most important of these is x resolution greater possible but unsupported
there are also new spells new abilities a new experience cap and gorgeous new areas to explore
additionally if youre a patient person or a rich one with broadband you can go download additional areas from interplay for free
all in all its a pretty fine dealif you like shooting things in space buy this bundlecompared to the old n pokeacutemon game this one has a bunch of new enhancements mostly of course the new pokeacutemon being the biggest ones
theres also a bunch of cool minigames and a pokeacutemon quiz
you can battle alone in the battle arena or gym leader castle or with friends in the event battle arena
earls pokeacutemon school will help you improve your battle techniques and game strategy
the library will help with the game boy games
overall this game is great and definitely deserves  starsi wasnt expecting much after playing quotrunequot the last rd person view dampd type action game that i bought but this game is actually fun to play
like quotoniquot this game allows your character to learn and use different moves to take out your enemies
also blade of darkness lets you choose different characters to play a barbarian an amazon a knight and a dwarf
each character has different strengths and there are a wide variety of weapons at your disposalthe game engine is pretty impressive as well the lighting effects are really interesting
the game itself is not too impossible nor is it too easy
the save game feature also keeps the game from being too frustratingi would highly recommend this game to dampd fans as well as fans of action gamesplayed on gig p with rage ati  graphics
windows  prosomeone spent a lot of time working on the architectural details because this game is simply gorgeous
the only other game that comes close is halflife with blueshift graphic upgrades
if i was grading on graphics and sound effects alone id give this five starsbut you have to play it too and there is a long list of problems here
firstly this game suffers from the same problem that all rd person hacknslay games do  the camera ends up in the wrong place so you cant see guys that are whacking you
give me st person views any daytheres also the unique physics which are cool at first but soon it gets very frustrating having your opponent walk right through you and your character ends up staring at the wall ignoring your commands to turn around rather like my dog really
meanwhile youre getting whacked againthe difficulty level varies wildly too and some areas are hip deep in potions when youre topped up while other areas clearly have too many heavies without a chance to recover
i dont understand why theres such strict limitations on what you can carry  power potion  life  hp etc why not just allow you to carry say  potions of any kind
i also had problems dropping stuff which is very frustrating when it stops you picking something up
at one point i had to drink a potion before i could pick up a gemthere are cheats available but they are very flakey
for example they only work when you start a new level and once you load a saved game they dont work any more
i guess whines about cheats arent really valid but you cannot finish the game without themall the monsters are bipedal
i wish there had been a dragon or slime monster or something a little more interesting
actually the monsters were the weakest graphically too
some weapons with range would have been nice the bow was pretty boring compared to some of the weapons in quake ii or halflife
how about a holy handgrenade
the number of thy counting shall bei think four stars may be a little generous but the graphics especially water and fire were outstandingthis is simply the best rts i have ever seen heard of or played
its incredibly fun there are quite a few ingenious units the play is exciting and you really do need strategic skills to win and the replay value is  without a doubt
i simply cannot imagine a funner gameexceptthere are a few things bad about this game
lets start with the original version
big problem the enemies always know exactly where you and your units are
the radar jammers and stealth units are meaningless
another problem is the movement engine
units move diagonally until theyre aligned with the closest line of imaginary gridthen they proceed down that line until theyre right next to their destination where they move diagonally again to finally reach it
they dont actually move in a straight line to their objective
next the missile silos built by the ai units just sit there
they dont build missiles and they really dont fire them
next the enemy places its resource collectors in random spots quite often which is very annoying
plus some units it just refuses to build in any version of the gamenow for the problems with the upgraded game versions
the incredibly useful game info bar shows how many units youve build and the maximum and what the game speed is just fails to appear sometimes
some important things that used to be reported in the ingame text dialoge just stop showing up there
and the worst one of them allsavegame files get randomly currupted
youll try to load it and itll shut down the game
oh well sorry all that work for nothing
if it werent for that problem and the problem that the enemy always knows where you arebut there are cheats around that this game would get a full  stars
i really wanted to give it full marks but when i cant play most of my savegamesit has to be taken down a starim enjoying it  i havent played this sort of game since the mids
the graphics are better but the gameplay is the same turnbased goodness of yesteryear
naturally you can switch to continuous realtime if thats what you prefer
visuals are firstperson but fully dit reminds me of the might amp magic or elder scroll series or any number of other partybased rpgs
you make  of your own characters choosing from a variety of classes and races that you will not encounter in any other game
each character can have a unique voice and personality
your character is so customizable that few roleplayers should complainlevels come quickly for players that enjoy the strategy of upgrading their character
each level brings with it improvement in attributes and in skillsgamers raised on bioware products may disagree but i think this is worth its price
baldurs gate has its place and its a wonderful place
wizardry  is almost in a different genrei wont pretend wizardry s gameplay mechanics havent been already been well detailed either to praise or scorn them
i just wanted to commentaslow combat  yes combat is definitely not a fast and furious affair
battling several lowlevel opponents say rats or bats or crabs can be quite tedious
winfast i believe thats the name check on a forum site can be downloaded and speeds this sort of combat up significantly
try itwhether you despise or love wizardry  you have to deal with the combat system because youre going to use it alot
i have found satisfaction in anticipating what combatants and skills ill need as well as enjoyment in thoughtfully responding to an enemy with just the right weapon
however more than a few people apparently dread combat
this isnt a good sign or a small issue given that youll be getting into battles everywhereb strategy guide  i rarely buy them they generally repeat too much simple statistical info already known to you or contained in the game manual but the guide for this one is extremely helpful if youre lost confused dont want to accidently miss a valuable item cause you were in a hurry or just want to get on with it
i greatly recommend the guide if youre already moderately enthused with the gamec attitude  know what youre looking for out of wizardry  i hate to be patronizing or sound snobbish but this isnt in my opinion a game to be purchased for quick play or casual gaming
im not saying it requires geeklike dedication or initiation to some weird online rpg cult but it is oldschool slowpaced and for many of us very very interesting
theres a big world in here with much to explore and a lot to do it takes time to dig it out though
its worth itthis is the first of the wizardry series id played and i bought it solely on the glowing recommendations of people i dont know including the other reviewers here
im not a very big fan of turnbased rpg and the only other experiences ive had with them wizards  warriors and pool of radiance  were less than spectacular
i dont know about the slew of other turnbased rpgs but wizardry  has to be the best one ive played and though im predisposed towards them id even say its as good as realtime rpgs like baldurs gate or neverwinter nightsthe game has excellent graphics that require a good deal of pc power to bring out at full detail
the entire world is d and well textured and monsters have full motion and attack movements
spellcasting produces beautiful particle effects and each spell looks more or less unique
probably the only downside to graphics is that it takes a pretty serious video card to run the game smoothly if you dont have a fast pc and a  mb or better card youll probably have to turn off a lot of the detail to get this performancesound is probably the best part of wizardry  you dont see your characters on screen except for their portraits so their voices are pretty important
fortunately the voice acting is superb enough so that you actually get a personality out of the otherwise typical characters you create
additionally the music is good and other noises spells combat etc
are well donethe character customization is quite extensive though its not as complex as pen and paper dungeons  dragons probably a good thing
there are seven primary stats str int dex speed piety senses and vitality
theres also a respectable lineup of weapon proficiencies and spell schools and a huge list of spells and other classspecific and expert skills
additionally the best part you can choose personalities for your characters
these run the gamut from aggressive to eccentric
you can choose voices and portraits to match or not to match if you wish and both sets are extensive
there are  distinct classes and  races all of which grant you different stat bonuses resistances or abilities
theyre all quite balanced so you shouldnt have problems experimenting
all in all youll probably never make the same character twicegameplay is pretty straightforward and remarkably easy to learn
i would warn that it does start out a bit slow but this is primarily to acquaint new players with the system
at the start you form a party of  characters and can get up to  additional recruits in the game
you travel in a first person perspective in realtime with a somewhat reduced shooter control system and when combat begins it switches to turnbased
now i have heard people complaining about combat taking too long and equating it to battles in pool of radiance  let me assure you that its a whole lot better than that game i played through the entire thing so trust me though impatient people might find it a bit slow
you get experience depending on the difficulty of the encounter and monsters will respawn if you leave the area for a certain time camp or go to another map and then return
talking to npcs in this game is crucial if you want to know what youre supposed to be doing
unlike other rpgs the plot isnt paved out for you to follow and you can wind up truly bewildered and stranded if you dont ask for directions or information on your objectives
if theres something you dont understand do as you would in real life and ask and youll probably get an answer albeit sometimes only for a pretty sum in gold
occasionally youll find someone whos willing to join you for one reason or another eg
payment
dont expect them to follow you everywhere though
theyll rebel if you do things they dont like or go places they dont want to goalthough the game in general is excellent there are some flaws with the system
wizardry  does an excellent job of creating a realistic believable world
unfortunately many rpg gamers simply arent used to this and will be discouraged when they run into impossible encounters
this is very easy to do because you can go literally anywhere even places you probably shouldnt be going
other than turning the difficulty down the best thing to do in such an encounter is to not start it in the first place
needless to say saving frequently is a must i recommend turning autosave on and getting a priest to learn resurrect is pretty crucial if you want to buy anything besides resurrection powder from merchantsi must say though that even some of the typical encounters are very very difficult
if youre an experienced wizardry player itll probably be easier especially since you can import your characters and start at a high level
for beginners it might be prudent to sneak past large groups of enemies or take the long way around them
combat also has a big luck factor involved so replaying a battle might yield much more desirable results
i remember in particular a single battering hogar wiping me out just outside trynton and then reloading and getting an instant kill on him on the second roundaside from battle difficulties the maps themselves can be confusing
its advisable you look at them often as they arent labeled and there seems to be a scarcity of signs on dominus
your vision range is also not too great so even large things might not appear until you come close
sometimes i walked right past a place i was looking for several times before realizing it was right there
the good thing about this is when you finally do get there its quite a reliefwizardry  is probably the most realistic rpg ive played and the game excels in nearly every important factor of a successful rpg
it might start out slow but if you stick with it becomes a truly rewarding experiencei enjoyed playing throne of bhaal
the new areas are fun and so are the riddles monsters and quests that you find in the expansion pack
throne of bhaal adds quite a few special high level abilities and a lot of new items
the potion cases ammo belt for storing all of those extra arrows and bolts and the  ammunition were all great additions
there is a new set of unique magic items that one of the characters can forge for you using pieces that you find scattered throughout the game like the dwarven blacksmith in shadows of amn
the new monsters are wicked and intimidatinghowever the best part about throne of bhaal is that it continues the same ingenious design and attention to detail that was present in baldurs gate   each new area looks brilliant
each quest is different
the conversations between the npcs are entertaining and the voice acting is great
you do meet one new npc who can join you early on its an old friend of yours  dont worry youll see
the game has a lot of unique challenges which require you to read the books or parchments that you find in order to solve themthe saga has run its course though
the storyline has been stretched about as far as it can go
perhaps too far
the bhaalspawn theme lost its appeal for me long before i finished this game
on every street corner there is some legendary godlike bhaalspawn or some prophet that has predicted your coming for the past  years
how is it that the rest of the world never noticed all of these godlike characters running around
there is lots of yammering on about fulfilling your destiny and the taint of your soul etc
etc
the dialogue plays out like a bad star wars parody
especially the dialogue that involves imoenone big flaw of this game is that there are so many magic resistant and spellproof creatures that my magicusers hardly ever cast anything more than a handful of the same spells
the spell protection and combat protection magic is badly overdone in this game
there is way too much magic vs countermagic combat
the fighters totally dominate this game and mages just cast a handful of magic and combat protection removal spells over and over
every tough beast is resistant to your fireballs and acid arrows so there is no point in casting them
there is no balance whatsoever at these high levels and that is why i gave the game  stars instead of tob hasnt come out yet
people on this are rating shadows of amn
shadows of amn has the lousy frame rates hopefully tob will have a few fixes pumped into the cd if not then in future patches designed for tob
soa is a good game except for poor performance and engine troublegraphic wisereview update  still  four starsnow that the game is released and recieved by me i can give an accurate reviewor as close as possible review  why only four stars
the reason not engine trouble as i said earlier the engine is slow even set at general mhz graphic mhz and sound mhz but the game is limited in choices
i will have to try the full install howevermuch like serpent isle was to ultima vii the black gate tob is on a greater scale of immortals and the universe instead of just humblely going from village to village getting supplies wandering the landscape like witless cattle ect like bg  but it is also one big cut scene of do this and this cut scene will happen and so on
no choice
much like serpent islefor those that are familiar with richard garriots series  just a lot of dimming of the screen to the next scene like a play or something
one thing that is awsome as said by othersis serevok he is mighty strong and mighty fast and decently smart to bootnot a retard like my paladin quotleaderquot with  int
my lawful good cavalierpaladinof equall strenght to severok wo belt tolorates the darned creepo only so long as he does as he is told
no killing imoen or wrecking havok on villagers and such
amd recommended for any party
speaking of amd my computer cannot run this game well because amd is part intollerable
it is too picky on parts but that is a tech issue i guess
now back to the important stuff
tob is a pail imitation of soa but it is not a bad game
soa is hard to compair with anything
tob is after all an expansion nothing morein my opinion and soa is the game
tob is worth the money however and i am glad i got ityes i was sad to see it end the fate of the bhaalspawn finally decided
devestated actually
throne of bhaal does a good job of tying up all the loose ends and has a firm story line
indeed almost too firm
unlike the unlimited options shadows of amn offered tob is quite linear and there are few sidequests
the new dungeon of watchers keep is very well done i wish i could have stayed in there forever
i was however somewhat annoyed that my map was restricted only to the area allowed in tob and i was not allowed to return to any of the places open to me in soa
the romance dialogues were also a little cheesy and i must confess i didnt use the new abilities that your characters can acquire very often
still thats not much to complain about and i definitely recommend this gameif you are going to buy this game you will need to go to baldurdashs page and download some of the things on his site for it
you can increase the difficulty of the battles actually makes for a truely epic and hard final boss and also fixes some plot points that were removed imoens bhall taint finally manifesting saravok dialogue optionsthe quests in this game are definately a challenge and for the most part very fun
the biggest problem is that there really are not any side quests worth talking about
the plot is very see through i thought and really you dont see many new things that will take your breath awaywith that said the game does have its merrits
if you like bgii and dont mind a more liner plot then you will love this game
the addition of feats allows everyone to continue getting stronger and helps remove the problems of a ceiling for fighter types after all once you get to a certain point you just always hitthe ending battle when not modified is not too terribly difficult
on the other hand the modded end battle is definately not for those who are easily frustrated as you will most likely try and fail many many timesif you want a definate ending to the game then you should give this game a try
however if you dont feel to strongly about it then consider avoiding it since it is pretty much just more of the same
dont expect a plot that will draw you into what is going oni too encountered the laggy slowframe rate problems in shadows of amn
my computer system consists of a mhz p  megs of sdram a rpm hard drive and a mb tntultra video card
the frame rate was drastically improved by downloading the latest video drivers from nvdia
i also reduced the number of path finding nodes available for the ai from k to k
the ai doesnt need that much path finding ability
the frame rate for the multiplayer mode remained atrocious though
it was about ten times worse than single player mode
i found that toning down the graphics settings did little to improve frame rate
in order to play soa with a decent frame rate you need to do or have the following  have the latest drivers for your video card
 always do a full install
it will save your computer a lot of time not having to turn to your cdrom drive so much
 if you can afford it have a decent video card with a minimum of megs of video ram and a decent hard drive with at least  rpm
the higher the rpm the faster data from your hard drive can be pulled
if youre wondering why i have a rpm hard drive its because i bought it before i knew that hard drives had different speedsi hope interplay paid attention to gamers complaints and remedied this problem in tob
if not theyd better get a patch out in a hurrybesides the tech problems this games the bomb
the new two weapons fighting ability allows your party to wade through enemy ranks like never before
powerful new spells like lower resistance which levels the playing field when fighting magic resistant enemies imprison which is very useful for dispatching innocent civilians whove you accidently turned hostile without taking a reputation hit and a whole plethora of antimagic shield spells which render powerful mages and priests vulnerable to attackthis is an expansion and should be considered like one
it does not improve upon the original baldurs gate ii so much that i would buy bgii just to play this expansion the way i would buy starcraft just to play its expansion brood warsfor those who already own bgii however this is an investment more than worth the money
the new areas especially the nowinfamous watchers keep are fairly challenging the new spells skills and items are almost mindboggling in their sheer kicking power and theres a brand new if not terribly original storyline to boot
youll definitely want this expansion if you wanted to play the bhaalspawn saga to its bloody endas an added bonus throne of bhaal allows players to use the tab key to highlight items on the ground chests doors etc
while this may not sound like much of an improvement now that i have it i cant imagine playing bgii without iti am certainly doing my part to waste time this spring
the monday before i picked up my computer i snagged a copy of fallout tactics from fred meyers
an inordinate amount of my time has been sacrificed to complete this viscerally addictive game to the point my college grades sufferbased on the insert superlative here fallout series of rpgs fallout tactics trods a new direction into the world of squadbased combat since a squad is actually a ten to fifteen man unit as opposed to six it would be more appropriate to call it teambased combat
you are a brotherhood recruit the first line of defense against the degenerates of midwestern wastelands
you serve a faction of the brotherhood sent on a reconnaissance mission over the rockies only to end up stuck in chicago
no more
much has been learned and it is time to return to californiafallout tactics arrives on three discs and since i have the space and ram to run everything off my hard drive i do not know when or if a transition between discs is needed to play
i suspect three discs are required to contain the quite impressive quality and quantity of sound which shake my sub woofer
explosions reverberate
rifles crack
mysterious objects in the distance squeak and howl
many areas feature creepy nighttime desert wind sounds
and when one crawls through a subterranean bunker and hears the anguished cry of some inhuman thing in the darkness one tends to feel unnerved
as a cherry on top fallout tactics leans heavily on voice acting
the infamous actor of full metal jackets gunnery sergeant hartman lends his marine drawl to general barnaky your characters co many other familiar voices will pop upsuch characterizations seem to substitute the dialogue screens of the original rpg
instead of picking witty conversation options your character simply listens to an npc while subtitles present themselves in a tiny dialogue screen next to a green thumbnail still of the speaker
such is why i must stress fallout tactics is not a roleplaying game so much as it is a postapocalyptic syndicate
elements of interplays fallout scheme appear but it is action and blood at heart like any firstperson shooter
and like british cyperpunk or cyborgdemon shoot em ups tactics obeys a very linear story which moves moves moves people
no side adventures to the sierra army depot or broken hills
every experience is an official brotherhood mission related to the tale
virtually all missions involve killing multiple someones such is life in the brotherhoodsuch life means houseto house fighting bunker raids sabotage missions and mazes worthy of the most convoluted doom or quake level only not in firstperson
and if this sounds tedious after a while fear not for as tactics declares life in the brotherhood has changed
each level is increasingly difficult and destructive as your enemies grow in numbers firepower and armor far greater than is available to your squad
ammunition for the best weapons is scarce and by the time you collect a decent amount the enemy has better armor and you have found a new weapon
tactics never fails to keep the player on toes and practically falling out of chairsometimes such challenges border on frustrations
unlike the rpgs one has the option of realtime play where only the use of equipment is governed by action points which continuously regenerate
this is effectively realtime
it also effectively keeps you from laying back on the trigger of your vindicator minigun ala syndicate
while the enemy cant do the same to you i always found victory through a superior rate of fire and a large magazine to be a particularly effective means against cyborgs
ah but this is tactics not hitman and tactics allows your character to sneak crouch and bellycrawl
those of you used to the stand up fights of fallout will die very quickly
as mentioned even mere human enemies can frequently wipe your squad out with greater skill and power than you can hope to wield
i have spent as much as an hour attempting to advance six feet
fallout iwo jima would be an accurate nickname for this gameto help the uninitiatedor shall i say initiates i offer some handy tips
achieving rank in the brotherhood is important
rank allows you access to better gear and team membersall ammuntion aside from xmm is scarce
you will find very few shotgun shells or rifle rounds
use submachine guns as much as possible in the first two or three missions
especially save shotgun ammo for supermutant and robot missions
once you finish the first super mutant mission mm will become abundant and you will find fair amounts of  caliber and mm roundsavoid close combat
your team is stuck with weak leather armor until you first encounter robots
most of your enemies will have higher hit points and armor class
i have had human enemies kick my character to death even as i fired chaingun bursts into them at point blank range
many of your enemies are so tough they will actually run out of ammo and charge you before you can kill them
super mutants and robots also have super tough critters charge you while their buddies fire
automatic shotguns especially the pancor jackhammer will decimate close foes
beware of scurrybotsmass sniper rifle fire should be your choice of attack whenever possible
always have an automatic shotgun or a browning m in your other hand in case the enemy charges
if an enemy is entrenched but cannot detect you lay mines and toss grenades to save ammo and your life
finally if forced into close combat use browning ms and automatic shotguns or at least fn fals and steyr augsi must say that fallout  and  are my favorite rpgs ever
due to their nonlinearity a storyline that is epic but not only that it was done in a hugely customizable way
they give you a world you create most of the storythis is one thing i resent about tactics you are pushed in one direction and one direction only
of course there are moments when you can choose from two missions for which one to accomplish first but in the end they all must get done
the last area is the only time you have a chance to make an affect on the ending but the endings can be interesting especially if youre a fan of the series
if they dont make a new fallout rpg in the future ill be extremely disappointedthose points aside it is a farabove average tactical squadbased game at the time it came out and still good today
your characters can be greatly customized
it can be nice to keep all them alive because newly recruited squad mates may not be as completely tailored to squad needs but overall theres no need to fret as you can hire more
just dont let the main character die or  game overyou create a main character with who is better in some base attributes than others such as perception strength intelligence etc
your other squad members have these set by the computer
these factors determine how much weight you can carry what size weapons you can use how far you can shoot with accuracy how well you can speak how quickly you can level up skills etc etc
through the game as you gain levels you can upgrade all your troops with their various weapon skills explosivestrap skills lockpicking sneaking and just about anything else you could hope for in an elite military force
perks are also gained every few levels which can definitely be fun to sift through and once you pick one can really help you outpretty much it is in the players hands to determine what each character can do how well he can do it and overall create a kick ass tactical squadron
it is best to have a wellrounded squadron with at least one guy that is pretty good at electronics one at explosives one at lockpicking and like any good combat game you dont want all six snipers or all six heavygunners
its great fun to mix it up use various combinations of weapons to make yourself a liquid forceoverall it made some very good spins in my cdromfallout tactics is an awesome mission based fallout military game
you pick a squad after your first mission and can have up to  characters
you get to have vehicles and all sort of things
the story line has twists like in the earlier fallouts
cool new continues turn based games for people who perfer a more active battle but you can also do turn based
this is a great game with multiplayer on game spy thats a lot of fun
graphics are way improved since the other fallouts
its more mission based so you can concentrate more on fighting stats then other stats but its good to have a doctor and so on but its a great game
but
since this is an interplay game they arent very with it on what gamers are having troubles in the game
there are some graphical glitches in the game
a few bugs that people can exploit
the game can seem to lag and believe me i have  megs of ram and i still had problems when scrolling ove rhte map sometimes so the coding is a little on the long side but it seems to be a more sound programing in this game then the other fallouts
its a great game the only reason its now cheap is because interplay didnt hype it enough and most people dont know about it or fallout as you would think
plus its a little on the gore side so i know some people arent into that but there is a setting you can change to turn off or lower the gore and blood
thanks for reading and buy this game if you like fallout  and or  buy this game or even if you didnt like fallout  or  its still a great game for people teens and college agei was a bit dubious about the value of a fallout game that is completely based on tactical engagement
after all the real strength of both fallout  and  was in the story and setting rather than the combat
fallout tactics struck me as a fun addition to the series but definitely not the fallout game that a newcomer should start with
the reason i say this is that the combat grind of the game can get wearisome and it will be pretty severe on the difficulty side for someone who has no idea how to playaside from the fact that its hard to outdo a classic fot makes no pretense of having an indepth story or serious interaction with nonplayer characters
in other words its definitely not an rpg
you are given very specific guidelines for each mission and you carry out your orders no questions asked
to help you on your way you can recruit various brotherhood soldiers and fully control them
by fully control i mean theyre basically identical to a player character the only difference is they dont have traits
dont you wish you could have done that with your loyal followers in the rpgsas for game improvements the engine has been improved a great deal
you can now crouch to reduce your target profile get a better view from high up and engage enemies that arent stupid
you can also drive vehicles and use them in combat
the graphics are all completely new which makes it fun to see just for the sake of seeing it
there are a host of new weapons including many guns that probably should have been in the old fallouts where did all the mps colts and berettas go
theres also a ton of new items of various worth the usual worthless but funny items and some that you might actually use such as meds and of course the steroidsadditionally there is a new continuous turn based mode a fancy way of saying real time
its something you will probably never use unless you hopelessly outgun your enemies or youre looking for a quick trip to the morgue
the action looks pretty neat in realtime but the difficulty of the missions makes it impractical
if you want you can give orders to your characters so they act more or less autonomously making realtime feasible but whats the fun with thatthe bottom line is if youve played and enjoyed fallout and the unique combat system in particular youll also enjoy this
if youre looking for an rpg or a continuation of the previous plot line this isnt it
also if youre looking for a completely unique turnbased trategy game you should check this one outbesides being the latest and likely last
of the xwing games alliance is also the best  bringing the series back from the hole it sat in after xwing v tie fighter to the epic trail blazed by the original tie fighter
the real question though is whether its improvements make it worth getting to players who bought the older games
in alliance you play the youngest son of family that owns an intergalactic shipping business
moving stuff from system to system you pilot freighters through lawless tracts of space
in a time of civil war your family tries to stay neutral even as its split along prorebel and imperialloyalist sides guess which side youre on
despite its seemingly civilian trappings the family business is all about combat  your ships come armed with turbolasers and ioncannon and equipped with deflectors
though you wont face imperials immediately combat will come quickly  forcing you to fend off the viraxo your familys hostile rivals
as the war progresses the viraxo leap to the empires quarter essentially forcing you to side with the rebellion and making you trade your corellian transport in for an xwing fighter
until then the game offers a series of missions that modestly test skills you may have amassed if youve played the older sw fighters games but are more likely intended as a tutorial
on an interesting note scifi fans may note a resemblance between the viraxo fighters and the angel fighters from captain scarlet
the game climaxes with the epic battle of endor in which you take on the nd death star from the inside in a mission i like to refer to as operation watchthatoverpass
as in older games you fly alongside and against ai pilots though theyre more chatty than before including a motormouthed droid named mkay who makes cpo sound positively mute making the dialog sound more natural than it should
alliance is a bit of a disappointment  its ties to the original xwing of  are painfully clear in terms of graphics and gameplay  this is still about flying canned missions in linear order in which you must complete by fulfilling a set of specific goals ie no matter how many tie fighters you swat down all lambda shuttles must dock with the medical frigate all of the correlian cruisers must survive you must inspect every container etc
some of the missioncritical goals seem counterintuitive  resulting from prescripted twists in a given mission
for example when a friendly ship becomes disabled its crew is forced to abandon it and you to destroy it  you only figure out that second part after numerous postmissionfailure messages
even so once youve figured out what to do and begun blasting the abandoned friendly to spacedust your wingmen warn you that youre firing on a friendly and that mission critical craft are under attack
because a lot of ingame dialog is prescripted which means that its the same nomatter how youre doing its harder to tell whether youre doing well or notgraphics and sound are improved though i guess we expected that
the big news is that you can now padlock those enemies or missioncritical craft  which is great not only for improving your situational awareness but also because you can view the insides of your ships flightdeck this is a huge leap over previous games which essentially gave you d renderings of the same flight panels weve seen since 
while shading and lensing effects are also added i usually get to focused on the enemy to really appreciate them
im also not enough of an audiophile to comment on the sound though the sound effects and john williams score remain as expectedly faithful to the films as weve come to expect
the mission areas seem larger and you now seem to have even larger numbers of enemies to fight against clouds of fighters instead of just swarms
also you may now have to zoom into different areas via hyperspace buoy in a single mission  although i just find that increases the chances of running into bugs that make missions unwinnablethe games most revolutionary improvement isnt technical at all  relying on a story that at first makes you more than just another faceless rebel flyboy
looks like somebody at totally games fired up a copy of the orginal tie fighter and was reminded why that game was so much more popular then xwing
instead your fight is for survival against greedy competitors soon to become a personal vendetta against the empire
characters you meet between missions including mkay and other vengeful relatives advance the plot and keep it focused throughout successive missions
if anything the story could have kept you out of the rebellion a bit longer or at least made the transition a tad smoother  the story loses something once you become a rebel pilot though manages to hold onto you anywaywith the passage of time most pcs should run this game without problems
i played it on my p having no winxp compatibility problems
the game probably supports opengl graphics acceleration if it doesnt its doing the greatest impression of hardware acceleration ive ever seen
in short an xwing battlesim thats guaranteed to please though obviously pleasing most those whove never tried one beforea space simulation game like wing commander alliance throws you into the rebellion between the empire strikes back and return of the jedi films
as with all such games a good flight controller is strongly recommended
the real innovation is there are two games in one
you play a a space merchant whose family business is attacked and almost destroyed by a rival merchant
after you join the rebellion mission are split between family and the rebellion with about one family mission for every three rebellion ones
while at the end you save the family business there a couple loose threads arent wrapped up
the rebellion mission end with you destroying the death stars reactor in the millennium falconi did have one issue as a directx  game it would only use software rendering on my directx  box until i manually changed the games ini fileplus good story linebutbesides that i think this game is difficult to play even though i reccomend it to any star wars gamermegaman x is a great game
i dont know why everyone criticizes it so much
it has the same great megaman gameplay the same great graphics the series is known for the same amount of action and a very high level of challenge
ive heard a lot of complaints about the games difficulty and yes although it is insanely difficult how can you call yourself a megaman gamer if that isnt what youre looking for in a mmx game
ive also heard some criticism on the music
sure its not fitting for megaman but its good enough on its own nothing worth complaining about like everyone does
and sure the guns n roses theme is tacky but does that really change how the game plays
guns n roses theme or not the bosses in this game are cool
i dont know why everyone hates this game
could it be because they tried something new and made it so that you could only use armor after collecting all the pieces
is it the absence of anime cutsceneswhich although disappointing does not change the gameplay at all
is it cuz the game is timed and has several branching plot points that make the game more immersive into the plot than the others
what is it
i want some answers people cuz this is a good game
for those of you who have taken someone elses opinion as your own at least try the game so you can see for yourself that its a great game featuring the same great mmx gameplay weve all come to know and love and the interesting plot weve come to expect from megaman xmega mans exploits have been taking place on a variety of different platforms for more than a decade but recent attempts to bring old mega man into d have largely been missteps
thats why we were chomping at the bit to play mega man x because it marks a longoverdue return to mms d rootsunfortunately the game plays more like a rushed overcorrection than a nostalgic sidescrolling romp
for example you can now choose between three playable characters zero x and fourth
its a good idea but the problem is that the characters are so different that this option actually destroys the fluidity of the gaming experience
in the original mega man x titles you couldnt progress until you found a weapon that could be used to destroy a particular boss
in x bosses can be put out of their misery with the zsaber and the xbusterbut the games biggest problem is its difficulty
the first law of game design is that a game should provide gradual continual challenge
x just keeps getting easier and easier due to the endless number of checkpoints and unlimited continues
the result is mega man with training wheelsby mega man standards this game is truly a disappointment
on the bright side if you are new to the gaming scene and are looking for a simple game that will help you improve your skills this game might be your cup of tea
for most gamers though x is way too easyi like that you could play as x or zero and that zero also had the powers from the enemy well not all power bc some of the things learned were skills and not something as a new blade for the sword or somethingthe good great story different characters are awesome nice graphics fast and fun gameplaythe bad nothing new for mega man vets no multiplayer some missions can just be out right unfairive never played a mega man game before plain and simple
why you ask
because i just couldnt get into the series
after finally picking up x up mainly because its the best out of the x series i really like mm now
x has a great story and great level design along with quick fast gameplay
you have to rebuild an old gun ship and mega weapon to destroy a meteor heading for your planet
to rebuild these things you have to beat different mavericks who have each partnow some levels are just insanely difficult like one level in which your on a speedster and it goes so fast the who level is just pure trial and error
of course if youre a mm vet then this game may not be so impressive to you but for me it was
i love this game and its one of my favorite platformers of all timei loved the sims when it first came out  it was bizarre and voyeristic but fun to watch nevertheless
this expansion pack is good and fun but not quite uptopar as quotlivin largequot was
it almost seems as if the success of quotlivin largequot prompted the rush of the creation of quothouse partyquot and the performance shows despite the great additionsfirst the good  yes there are a number of additions
most of them have to do with having a party hence the theme
theres a dance floor with a killer stereo plus dance cages buffet accessories with a caterer you can hire a mechanical bull that helps a sims physical points a birthday cake costume party accessories a mime that shows up when the party is dead and makes it worse party crashers that show up eat all your food and crash on your couch and drew carey shows up when you throw a big party and flirts with your guests in fact on his webpage it said that he was such a fan that he did the voice for the quotdrew simquot for the game
not to forget the quotbubble machinequot that mysteriously looks like a hooka  your sims tend to giggle while they blow on it and eat lots of food afterwards
  and dont forget the chunk of new furniture decorations and themes you can usenow the bad  unfortunately there seems to be glitches in the game that ive seen a lot of
the voices seem to go to the wrong sims ie my dad snores like a little kid they get stuck in areas two sims kept trying to walk down the street and kept getting stuck and dying in the street and sometimes the game just plain locks up let alone plenty of other glitches
i have no doubt that maxis will release a patch and it could be worse but they should have worked out all the bugs first before releasing the packif youre new to sims you have to get the first i think both games to play the latest which can cost a little bundle
its still worth it if you find yourself addicted to sims from watching someone else or trying someone elses game
think of it like playing dollhouse as a kid except all of the dolls interactif youre a player looking to buy the new pack youll enjoy the new pack especially if you like the game so much
maxis doesnt tell you everything to look for on the game and its fun trying out new things to find
the cops always come to my parties and break it up
  fun but slightly buggy game
theyll probably come out with another pack soonthe sims house party was originally created with the purpose of making social interaction easier however what it failed to do was add lots of new social points interactions and mainly focused on giving you new objects where you can have more then one sim involvedthere are three main themes that are included in both the objects and decor
first the tiki theme which is really well detailed and comes in handy later iwth hot date and vacation when building swim shops and island retreats
then we have the country theme with a mechanical bull western bar and campfire to tell spooky stories or have a sing along
finally there is the industrialrave theme with inflatable couches a really cool bar and the best set of objects from this expansion pack the dj booth dance floor and dance cages which reallllly are great for other expansions in the futurethere are a few other cool options with this game including the quotthrow partyquot option with the phone and the caterer who can show up and fill up your buffet table and punch bowl for when you have guests
the costume trunk is also pretty cool when you want to have theme parties
while the game does have a lot of neat new objects it isnt the best one out there but a definite plus to have to expand other areas like downtown vacation old town because the objects are some of the most funfirst off  let me say that many of the features in this expansion pack are available for free and can be downloaded from thesimscom website
that said the best features are only available on this cdwhy only  stars
primarily because its rather expensive for only a few themes  country western hawaiian luau and underground rave
ive also run into my share of bugs like many of the other reviewers including a rather annoying bug where flies circle the bathroom incessantly no matter how many times i clean everythingon the plus side the music is incredibly well done
in this expansion pack the choices have been expanded once you get the right equipment to include many other genres such as countrydance beach rap techno and disco
the music gets stuck in your head  its that good
i think i like the country music on here better than anything ive heard on country stations and i find myself singing the soontobefamous disco tune quotdee dee dee bo bee  bee bo bee bo pee poquot as im scrubbing my own reallife toiletswith all this cool music theres got to be some dancing right
another nice feature is the quotbouncemybooty dance floorquot which has patterns that change as additional floors are added and daisychained together
i also hear celebrities show up if your party is cool enough
hasnt happened to me yet but im working on it maybe once i get that swimming pool to encircle the dance flooranyways if youre interested in any of these themes youll have a lot of fun with the expansion pack as there are a lot of new themerelated props and decorations from dj systems and gogo cages to mechanical bulls to communal bongs cleverly disguised as bubble blowers
if these themes dont appeal to you or entertaining the entire neighborhood seems like it would be a chore then you may be better served by the additional customization available on the living large expansion pack or the downloads available on the many simsrelated websitesits an expansion to a really great game of course its going to sell
this expansion pack brings more cool things to mess around with
they added more themes like a cowboy theme and a hawaiian theme
they have more chairs titles toys electronics and even a bull
this expansion pack will provide you with many more hours of fun
who ever thought of the sims needs to be given an award
there are so many things this game could have
you might see  or  expansion packs
you cant go wrong with the simsout of all of the sims games this is definitely not my favorite
i personally liked the sims livin large expansion pack better than this
i didnt feel that this game gave as much new stuff as the others and throwing the parties is kind of boring
i do still recommend this game to anyone who has liked the last two sim gamesthe sims house party expansion pack is a good investment if you really like the sims for what it is and are not expecting any big expansions of game play
what you do get are some interesting party motifs tikki countrywestern rave a couple of new items and some more group interactionpros parties are easier to throw with the mass invite option
its much more timeefficient than calling up each individual person or even using the party balloons
several items like the campfire and bubble machine allow for more group interaction making maintaining social relationships easier
they also provide some interesting sound files featuring more simspeak the nonsensical language your sims speak and simsinging around the campfire
some practical additions objectwise like smaller dining room tables for instance which can replace the behemoths the first pack provided also are welcome additionscons as other reviewers said the game is a little buggy
my game crashes every so often now even though it never crashed before with the original or the livin large expansion pack
it doesnt run quite as smoothly as one would like
i did take care to prepare my computer thoroughly running scandisk and defrag before installing but im still having problemssim fans will want this game for the new objects and actions but those who are not nuts about the sims should not expect this game to provide anything to up their enthusiasmim a genuine sims enthusiast but im kind of disappointed by this latest expansion pack
it has some neat stuff though
about  new outfits for men and women and  new outfits for girls and boys
there are also some new adult heads
and of course there are new floors and wallpapers
but this isnt too thrilling because you can download just about any kind of floor or wall or outfit off the internet
there are a few new doors including a saloon door and restroom doors for malefemales and some windows none too exciting  new staircases and a transporterelevator thing
add to that some new shrubs fences and a cactus and your sims yard can look really neat
indoors theres new furniture
theyve added some new bamboo stuff so if you want to reinact quotsurvivorquot that shouldnt be a problem
theyve also added new decor and accessories in the themes of western disco warehouse and more
then comes the fun stuff a bubble blower a buffet table a cake for a dancer to pop out of a lightup dance floor a dance cage etc
plus a new option to hire a caterer
however the price of this game seems a little steep for the amount of new stuff you get which aint much
but if you love the sims and cant get enough of them this is bound to brighten up your little sim houses and make things a little more fun
so this is not a musthave but its still pretty cool
note i have a newish computer and with this latest expansion pack installed the game runs a lot slower than it used to thats kind of frustratingi bought the sims the week it came out and became addicted from then on
it is a near flawless game no doubt a classic
livin large was great but that only gave new objects
before this came out it was hard for the sims to throw any kind of get together because by the time you called  people it was already  in the afternoonhouse party lets you throw parties along with tons of new cool objects and things to do
it is awesome a definate reccomend
the only complaint i have is that the other sim games ran really fast on my computer and this one takes about  minutes for the game to load into the neighborhood section
its ridiculous but its worth the loading time
my favorite new item has to be the dance floor and the dancers that come out of the birthday cake too duh
definately reccomendedalthough house party is another great expansion and musthave for your collection it is not quite as amazing as livin large
this doesnt mean that you should purchase ll instead of house party im just saying dont expect to be spellbound
hp adds as always over  new objects including the kamprite campfire a great group activity light up dance floor and bubble blower also for up to four sims
as the second expansion pack for quotthe simsquot hp now allows you to invite over more than one person ina single telephone call
the option quotthrow partyquot is now available in the telephone pie menu
in addtion to party and group items the hp expansion pack also adds three new themes rave luau and cowboy which include a mechanical bull dance cages and palm tree wallpaper
for the collecter or pc game player house party is an excellent addition to quotthe simsquot but i suggest purchasing the game after you have purchases quotlivin largequot as wellthat we need a game that will allow us to live through a bunch of computer sims
i dont care how sad we are
this game over all is great
the last expansion was better than this one but over all its well worth the money
now if my wife would just leave me alone so i can interact with my other familyhouse party is probably the second best of the sims addons behind livin large
the party idea is a good concept that provides a chance for your sims to invite everyone in the neighborhood over for a toga or formal party or even just a turkey dinnersome of the things in the addon pack are weird like the mechanical bull the campfire the costume trunk and the parlor game
they all seem to give your sims great fun though and the parlor game is good for speaking skills
the costume trunk can help liven up parties and prevent the dreaded mime from showing up
theres even people to pop out of huge cakes caterers and food items that can be purchased with a party in mindthe biggest drawback to this addon is if you have the livin large addon the load time is increased
if youre running a fast system ghz or higher you probably wont notice a big slow down but it did slow down my ghz machine
if you have hot date as well the load time is really longthe sims is an excellent game and the expansion packs just make it better
this is the game that i have played the most and i dont think that i will get bored of it
there are over eighty new objects that will keep everyone from the diehard player to the casual fan happy
lets hope that they still keep these expansion sets coming as i dont ever want to stop playing this gamethis game looks cool
good graphics pretty good gameplayetc
but i feel this game is lacking one major feature bob barker
can someone please tell me where he is in this game
it really makes me mad they forgot to put him in this game
but i guess i can live with itsighfor nowi was originally going to get the dreamcast version of quake iii arena because of its keyboard and mouse support but im glad i got this instead
the new campaign mode is little more than isolated matches with rudimentary statbuilding but the gameplay is still great
the minor autoaim similar to that seen in serious sam solved the biggest problem i had with the pc version the difficulty of hitting targets despite having the precision of a mouse
this version also has multitap support to bring the maximum human players to  but also allows for bots of varied skillmy only real gripe with this game is the buttugly graphics
they somehow look worse than the dreamcast version a year prior maybe im comparing it too much to games like god of war but nevermindthis game is excellent if u like games like doom and timesplitters
i find this game slightly better than timesplitters but it is very slow
the controls are very easy but aiming up and down can be a pain if you are in that kind of situation
i guess i gave it four stars because it is the best game of its kind by farfor its slow speed i took one off
i can probably finish  eggs and orange juice while it is loading the level
i love the gameplay because they actually went a little past a few drops of blood spilling out unlike most games
dont buy this game unless you have friends to play multiplayer with because it can get boring playing the same thing over and over just to beat the vadrigar
thats all  
happy gamingquake has been known as being one of the best in the relm of first person shooters
for the most part i agree
it holds your attention provides hours of decent gameplay and keeps you coming back for more
however like many first person shooters of its time it followed the typical scifi feel
with games like half lifealiens vs predator unreal it just seems to hit on the nail that it is a scifi game
thus we get some easily recognizable feelthis game has a story very shallow but its a first person shooter
you play one of four cahrtacters who goes through the realm of combat starting from slave and ending in overlord
to win the levels are multiplayer style events
kill most creatures capture the flag and so on
you get the basic idea
you are graded on performance and get your stats increased accordingly
so if play more defense you defense will grow faster but offense will not and viceversaoverall it is really meant for multiple players
otherwise your just not having as much funtake on the role of jonathan harker
search for clues to find the mystery of draculas sanctuary
asside from a few major problems this game was quite good
ill go over the problems first  all the data in the game was read directly off the cd and that data wasnt precached either read into memory before being used in the game so a lot of the time the game takes a while to play a small sound or display an image
that got somewhat annoying but ignoring that the game was well donethe graphics arent really as amazing as the box might suggest but theyre not bad either
the story was pretty good even though there was very little spoken dialogue
i think there was some nudity in the game so younger players beware some of the puzzles are somewhat discouraging but if you search every part of every scene thourouhly youll find what you need
and be sure to try to combine everything with everything else both in inventory and the scenerydracula  the last sanctuary picks up exactly where dracula  left off
it is much much more involved than the first one and a little but more difficult and i dont remember dying in the first one but you can sure die in this one
while i really dont like dying in any case it is especially annoying here because you have to load your last saved game which takes time and if you werent prepared can force you to have to do a lot of stuff over
navigationfirstperson pointandclick interface easily understood
exactly like dracula   cursor is easy to see
use the space bar if you get tired of watching jonathan go up and down stairs
storystory was fine although not especially engaging
not scary either
graphicsgraphics are terrific if a little dark at times
dialogfive stars for dialog which was almost nonexistent
thats just my opinion though  i dont like dialog and nonplaying characters  some people do
soundambient sounds are appropriate there is no music except in cutscenes
i think music is important so i give low marks on that accountperformanceflawless
inventory controlmuch like dracula  with the added interest of an outer ring of objects which can be combined with some objects in the inner circle
still cant right click to close it
puzzlessome puzzles are easy some are hard
hot spots can be very hard to find either because they are small or because they werent there last time you looked
most puzzles are inventory based some with timed sequences in which you will die if you cant figure out what to do fast enoughthis game is a whole bunch longer than its predecessor
its a pretty good game overall and should probably be on the shelves of myst fans
syberia fans might not like it as wellif you are considering a purchase this dracula path of the dragon disk came with an extra disk containing both dracula  and microids dracula iii
dracula  is a much different game but thats another reviewafter reading about how sega had really messed up wsbk i was completely deterred from even renting it
but when i heard that sega was stepping down and letting visual concepts up to bat for k i like many others was looking forward to a great sporting experience similar to visual concepts previous titles nflk nbak etc
and while its a solid game that captures the feel of baseball it has its shortcomings
wsbk looks all right graphically and the animations look cool but sometimes fail to animate
my player has spotted the flyball and is positioned to make the catch but his arm seems to have gotten stuck and wont lift to grab the ball
thats all right though  he somehow manages to catch the ball as it collides with his head
and those action replays that weve all come to love are completely absent
i know there isnt that much intense action in baseball but come on
that was an awesome homerun that deserves to be shown again
sound is good but the announcer never digresses to talk about the players and recent plays like they do in the nflks and nbaks
sometimes hes altogether wrong i hit it deep and the announcer shouts quothomerunquot just as it crashes into the wall and drops short for an inplay double
the game modes in wsbk are the usuals that you find in most sports games today
theres the single exhibition game the season that you can customize from the very short game run to the regular baseball season of  games a playoff mode that jumps you straight to the excitement of the postseason and the ultracool franchise mode that lets you mess around with a team by trading drafting and managing your players seasontoseason
theres also a home run derby but it isnt very fun and is really just a place to work out your swing
you can also play k online but though i havent had the pleasure of enjoying online gaming as of yet too pricey i have heard people complaining of lags
as i said earlier this game is pretty solid in its simulation of the gameplay associated with americas pastime its just all the little things that make it suck
firstly yes the game is two players but only against one another
why cant we play together
thats where acclaims allstar baseball  is better
but i guess ill just have to live with trading the controller back and forth
secondly visual concepts really messed up the createaplayer
sure they allow you to customize your players height and weight the color of his glove and bat and even his shirt style but theres no option to give him a characteristic pitching or batting stance or even an age
theres even a glitch that doesnt allow you to change the color of the first basemans glove
and get this you can only create three players
three measly players
why bother even giving us the option to make players if they cant even give us enough to constitute a full nineman team
once again allstar baseball wins this category
and thirdly the only thing that doesnt seem to accurately depict the sport of baseball is the low amount of strikeouts youll accumulate
you can pitch and get one strike two strikes but if its going to be a third strike the computer will almost always hit it it may be a foul or a flyball for an easy out but he usually hits it
youll be lucky if you get four strikeouts a game
wsbk isnt as good as i hoped it would be from visual concepts
in fact if it werent that you see their name each time you boot up the game you wouldnt think that visual concepts had anything to do with it
still it isnt bad
overall if you want good gameplay with better graphics go for wsbk but if you want good gameplay with better customization go with allstar baseball this game has everything the original sonic adventure had and then some
the game has some of the best and fastest graphics on the dreamcast
the games feel is incridible speed is the name of the game and with six playable characters and two different story lines  one for good and one for evil the game has lots of replay value
sa even has something the original doesnt a multiplayer mode
while its only for  players its still a lot of fun
this is a shining peice of work in the sad sad sad last days of dreamcast
is this its dying breathe well not exactly but its still a whole lot of fun for a great price
if you at all liked the original pick this one up now
you wont regret itthis game has a few small flaws which ruin a lot of fun in the gamegraphicshah
sony can never top this
smooth fast and highly detailed
you wouldnt believe that the sonicshadowlevels are still playable at such a furious speed
but the camera is still bad
this doesnt matter in the sonicshadowlevels since you just run forward
in the tailsrobotniklevels it gets worse theres more platformjumping involved
but in the knuckleslevels its a nightmare youll have to find  small gems in each level and the camera moves around you like a drunk
i even got dizzy from thisspeaking of the knuckleslevels who liked them in sa anyway
in sa you didnt have to play them because you could choose with which character you wanted to play
this isnt the fact in sa youll have to play the knuckleslevels if you like it or not so youll find yourself searching a stupid little gem for  minutes to be able to play those great soniclevels againbecause the soniclevels are top notch
it really catches the essence of good old sonic  although its a little too easy
the difficulty is compensated completely by the unbelievable graphics thoughthe tailsrobotniklevels hang a bit in between
sometimes its lots of fun to play blowing up everything that crosses your path but sometimes theres far too much platformjumping
this sometimes made me want to throw my beloved dc straight out the window
i dont know what it is about dplatformers i get frustrated much easier with them than their in my opinion much better dcounterpartslots of people hated the adventurepart in sa
i think it was a great idea but it wasnt executed the way they intended
it added a lot of depth to the game although i admit it could be quite frustrating from time to time
thats also a thing that sa misses depth
the rich and sometimes even touching that robot had to deactivate his own quotbrother
storylines of the original are completely missing here
it wasnt a good idea to sacrifice this for speedyoull finish the game quite quickly
after that you can do some extra missions for each level but the fun wears of very fast
the multiplayermode is also very dullso how does is all add up
making the game liniair was a big mistake
you wont be able to skip the games bad parts and it has got quite a few of them
so why did i still give it a reasonable mark
the sonicshadowlevels are awesome thats why
and altough there are only  minuteduring ones of them it still makes the game kinda worth your money
youll keep playing through the flaws to reach these levels
so i think you should buy it even though i dont think it has the charming character of the first part nor the challenging gameplay of the oldies
and ofcourse to give sega a final round of applauseas a long time sega fan and dreamcast owner i remember all the hype and excitement of the original sonic adventure
that game lived up to the hype in every way possible and when i heard about sonic adventure  i knew i wanted to buy and keep that game too
did it live up to my expecations
at the same time it did and in other ways it didnt
yes the graphics on sonic adventure  look even better than the original and the soundtrack despite having a few too many rap songs in the knuckles level was also really good
so where do i find fault in this game
the consistency and certain aspects gameplay are a little disappointing to me
the first sonic adventure featured  characters to play as and you could play them in any order
the difference in this game is that even though it also features  charachters to play as they are all pretty much the same sonicshadow tailsdr
eggman and knucklesrouge and you changed charachters without choosing to because sega made you
luckily the levels are pretty diverse and the story and cinema scenes were great
despite its shortcomings sonic adventure  is one of my favorite dreamcast games but is a little too far from being the best sonic gamegameplaywise sonic adventure  is a hyper less explorationall action version of sonic adventure
this latest installment to the series is more like the older sonic games in that there are only action stages and no quotadventure fieldsquot as in the first sonic adventure
also a new feature for a sonic game you can now choose whether you want to control the heroes or the villians
this is a great idea and it does add variety as far as the story goes but the villians robotnik shadow and rouge play very similar to the heroes sonic tails and knuckles
the graphics have also improved and the game almost always runs at a smooth steady rate
the only faults in sonic adventure  are the horrible scriptvoice acting and the glitchy camera
you can use the side triggers to circle around your character and view the area but you cant actually change the view and that leads to a lot of deaths due to blind jumps
its also very easy to build up speed in sonicsshadows stages and slip off the edge of the track
aside from that sonic adventure  is a rather solid game
there are also lots of minigames to keep you busy such as chao raising kart racing ect
if you own a dreamcast pick up sonic adventure its one the dreamcasts last great games
its a shame that the dreamcast is being put to rest so soon when games of this calibur are still being produced for itsega have managed to come up with the goods once again on sonic adventure   the graphics are far superior to the original the levels are better and there is more of a plot to the game
there is the introduction of new characters as well which will make the game more appealing
this is a must have game as i love d the first and this is even better and has held my attention for a long time now
go sonic
keep that sega flag flyingthis game lacks some of what sonic  had you cant go around town square and talk to people
sonic one was a lot more adventure filled than sonic  i think if you want to save money just get sonic  and wait for the price of sonic  to dropyou get  new drivers and you race in newyork not san francisco
you get to have some fun with the new crazy pyramid not cube from the first
and i like the pick up  feature that lets you earn more money
but i hate how its just like ct i mean it is almost to simalear
but it was so much fun the first days and it still is today but it just gets older and older every day
i only reccomend it for people who have never played ct
i love number  it was fun and i thought this one would be so much better but its not worth the fast buck that hot d brings up when you pick him as one of the driversits no secret quotcrazy taxiquot was a success on dreamcast
it sold many copys was well received as a great time killer and featured a great soundtrack
however there were a few complaints as no game is perfect
one of the problems was the fact there were only two levels in this game so you soon just memorized a set course and went on playing
then it was the fact that the crazy box just wasnt all that so not many people felt they needed to save a game
then they wanted more playing options like player and online modeswell your out of luck if you want all the above because except for two new levels this is pretty much the same game as the first
however there are a few changes that makes this game good anyway
for one thing people who felts hills were too easy have nothing to worry about hills are gone and turns are in
thats right you will spend more time turning then going up a linear hill
but for those of you who still like flying with your taxis dont worry press the y button on your dreamcast controller and your car will jump
cool huhthe new crazy box is still nothing great but i gusse some people still needs single player challinges
instead of  songs we have  songs by offspring in this game so you have a quotlittlequot more music to listen to while your listening to your customer shouting at you
the graphics are excattly like the first so thats a miner problem but not by muchtheres no two player or online modes so this is still pretty much a single player game
i dont think this is one of the quotstellerquot games of the year because its so much like the first but its still a little fun
i was going to give this game three stars but decided on four because they added quotenoughquot new things to keep me intrested
but i still hope quotcrazy taxi nextquot for xbox turns out a bit better stillthe best and worst things about this game is that it is like the original
while i am disappointed that there is no multiplayer and it would be the best thing ever if they had multiplayer the hop feature and the multiple passengar pick up is great
i am new to crazy taxi and jsut bought a dreamcast a month ago
this city is large in crazy taxi  where you go through a downtown area and can drive over a brige to another section of town through a huge park and more
the best thing is to drive for  minutes and see how well you can do in driving people places
its easy at first with plenty of time to spare
but towards the end when you have  seconds to get someone somewhere   miles away it gets a bit challenging
multiple passengar pick ups are great and controls are as smooth as they were in the original
the driving people to and from gets a bit repetitive but the mini games add alot of replay value
in one you hop over hurdles
in another you hit a giant golf ball with your car and watch it fly
in another you go off a huge ramp and let your taxi reach for the sky
now that you can get it for about  dollars used now is the time to get it
its one of the last great games for the truly under rated dreamcastdecent fun if you have a few minutes to killnot a game you will play for hours and hours but still gooda blend of old chinese myths and avantgrade science fiction make fear effect  a true originallike in the first game you start with hana and a new character rain doing an otherwise simple job when everything goes awry
half the world is dying from einds environmentally induced nucleotides degeneration syndrome and jin the same employer from the first game assigns you to steal a dna sequence that maps the gene that causes the disease
problem is the doctor guarding it just happens to be the richest man on the planet and has security out the yin yang
you go through hell to find this disc using both stealth and aggression to bypass all his security measures and its hell that chases after you when you steal itliterally
think of the taoist version of demons spiritual trials and torture and you will get my meaning exactly
evidently this einds was no product of nature and it was meant to wipe clean the earth of mankind
so you seriously tick off certain immortal beings for stealing this piece of generic codefrom here the game takes a sudden and more serious change of direction and you delve deep into spirit realms where you will meet figures of chinese myth namely the eight immortals in the mythical island penglai and qin shi haung in his ancient tomb of xian backed by his famed terracotta army
throw in some killer action humor and a lesbian encounter between the two protagonists and youll remember fear effect whether you liked it or not
youve never played anything like this believe me
this game is just nutsgraphics are absolutely phenomenal i bare in mind the dated technology that is being employed when i say thisnow as for the games irritations i will remark upon what many others have already complained about
there are only  or  guns in your inventory that are useful and when you run out of ammo on one of them and need to change to the other in the heat of battle good luck doing it when you got  items to scroll through
saves are sometimes not where they need to be
you can expect to play a lot of the same crap in certain areas
some people have said this game is either hard or difficult
unfair would be a more appropriate word since skill or wit alone often cannot save you
even when knowing exactly what to doyou will diewhen a game has an excellent if experimental storyline like this one its a shame the experience is hindered by challenges that require sheer luck in order for you to proceedif you got the patience you will find fear effect  a rewarding experience
i liked this game better than the first and it is one i will always come back toi recently purchased this game a few days ago realising that fear effect  will come in  sometime
for the review with this game one gets to experience the ultimate frustration and intensity of the game and for the game
in this game unlike others such as tomb raider or resident evil one learns how to die  a lot
the puzzles arent too complicated but some of them are somewhat difficult especially the reflex tests where you have to dodge enemies and various threats
the bosses in this game arent too hard per se but they do make resident evil seem like childplay especially the latter levels
like in tomb raider and resident evil one will practice tremendously to eliminate the bosses and unlike tomb raider and resident evil one will need to be truly conservative with your ammo and resources
one has to choose your targets wisely
in a few words you will die and you will learn to die constantly persistently and gracefully hopefully
the graphics of this game is actually very very crisp and detailed for an anime look
i like the level where you visit the tomb of the first emperor
they got it down nearly perfectly
even the sound effects are welldone with the perfect sound effect for the weapons movement and characters
lastly the story and the characters are very mature and they do curse and this game does involve suggestive lesbianism
if you liked the metal gear solid series then this is the game to get but the story for this game is much stranger and resembles something like the twilight zone and total recallthis is a great shooter for anyone who loves shooters
i wish the graphics were a little larger with so much happening on screen it can be a little hard to see
if you can get past that this is a fun involving shooter with plenty to see and do
i love the idea of anime style robots with very cool weapons like a missile that bounces off walls and a multi missile that blasts the heck out of everything
this is a great game for dreamcast to get anyone who loves a good shooter should pick it upat times this glorious d explosionfest can be more addictive than any drug
itll have you saying quotjust one more level and then ill stopquot and quotill try it just once more well maybe twicequot with alarming frequencyunlike traditional shooters bangaio lets you roam around freely without a selfscrolling screen to push you along
you can move in any direction and shoot in any direction simultaneously the control scheme is just like that of smash tv midways brilliant arcade game from  or so
the flying mech you pilot as well as the majority of your targets are understandably small the screen sometimes has to accomodate much more chaos and firepower than youd think could be produced by such tiny combatants
youve got two standard weapons to choose fromhoming missiles and ricocheting lasersand each of them can be launched in a screenclearing orgy of mass destruction which increases in size and proportion to the number of enemies and amount of gunfire already onscreen
the tiny bit of slowdown that sometimes occurs when you use your special attacks just makes it more dramatic
watch your score rise faster than gasoline prices as literally dozens upon dozens sometimes even hundreds
of projectiles wipe out everything in sight then grab the space fruit like a malnourished pacman for still more pointssome of the games  levels have puzzles involving bombs falling blocks and oneway doors
others are just allout carnage
the balance between the two is struck admirably
in each level youll face a boss after a brief conversation with himherit
this is where the games oddball sense of humor really shines
my favorite is the boss whose quotdialoguequot consists of childish drawings instead of words
the japanese to english translation is pretty weak but that just adds to the quirkiness of the experienceflaws
there are a few but nothing major
the biggest one is the fact that some bosses simply dont fight they remain motionless and make no attempt to stop you from perforating them
you might have some remaining normal enemies to contend with but still that kinda kills the fun
also the health boosters dont exactly grow on trees and there arent any extra modes or featuresbut are they really necessary
not in this game they arent
bangaio is still very satisfactory and who knows how many more games of its type well see once the playstation  xbox and gamecube are dominating the marketplace with d games that bore everyone half to deathbangaio is a great reason to own a dreamcast
shooter fans in particular are welladvised to pick it uprecord of lodoss war is one of those storied anime series thats been given the video game treatment several times in the past mostly in japanonly releases on the pc engine no less with largely disappointing effects
while record of lodoss war on the dreamcast has largelygratifying gameplay it should since it mimics diablo quite shamelessly those looking for a game truly faithful to the anime should keep looking
while the lodoss characters do make an appearance of two they are done in a very cameolike manner both ingame and in the cinemas which are oddly cg rendered rather than anime
for someone looking for a shameless dungeon slasher with lots of play time this ones for yougraphics  record of lodoss war is presented in the same isometric view presented in diablo which in this type of game is a very good thing as it gives you a pretty good look at the action from a d perspective without resorting to unplayable camera views you can go with  other camera views each of which is a  degree turn left or right from the isometric camera a problem which has plagued many a game since polygonal d became common
while many of the ingame characters are rather drab in color they animate fairly well and in a game like this theyre not going to be onscreen for too long anyway
at times when the screen is filled with baddies and projectiles which happens quite a bit actually the frame rate does slow to a crawl but it really serves as a minor annoyance as opposed to a major gameplayinfluence
overall the record of lodoss war while not overwhelming in its graphical package is not underwhelming either
its solid and for games like this or diablo thats enoughsound  you would expect record of lodoss war to excel in the sound department but again it merely gets by
voices music and effects are clear but not anything you havent heard before and done better
the music is your usual epic fantasy fare with a sometimes dark and brooding overtone
voices are clear and well done but the acting quality is barely better than that in the resident evil series deedlit
you get all the clangs groans and screams you expect in a diablo clone but they seem to lack the guttural and eerie quality found in this games inspirationgameplay  luckily for record of lodoss war this is the category that always counts and it delivers
game pacing is good even though some of the sideitems to be had later on are insanely difficult to get dragon items for instance
the fact that the game is largely nonlinear is another plus as you can more or less wander aimlessly through most of the game and still come across many of the optional dungeons youll need to fine for better items
the userdecided mithril upgrades are another ingenuity of this title that really adds to the overall effect as the player can pick and choose where he wants to allocate the mithril
while this is somewhat similar to diablos level up where you could allocate points to the places that needed them the fact that mithril is really a monetary system makes it nearly a sidequest to itself
control is tight and responsive and frankly in this area it easily outshines diablo as the clumsy point and click is replaced by analog movement and exacting blows
as for time well you had better have plenty of it because for a game like this even with no multiplayer mode youll need it
you will lose hours of sleep with lodoss perhaps an area where it mimics diablo even moreso than the game itselftheme  anyone who is a fan of the popular lodoss war anime series will attest to its unique blend of japanese style and classic fantasy themes
while the storyline would seem to work better in a partybased traditional rpg it works fine here albeit greatly watereddown
to be honest there is really a lot less lodoss war in this game than there is of say diablo
though some fans might be a bit miffed at the fact that the cast members of record of lodoss war are reduced to mere cameos and that the lodoss war label was added as an afterthought to increase sales the diabloinspired gameplay is good enough that most will forgive that much
with its extensive weaponarmor customization fasterpaced play mechanics and easytolearn control scheme record of lodoss war may even give diablo a run for its money in terms of its shall we say addictive qualitiesoverall   this is the real deal and probably one of the last rpgs of this calibur youll see on the dreamcast
while its not a perfect game certain types of gamers need not apply and you know who you are for fans of the genre this one is as close to diablo ii as youll get on the dreamcast
dont put it in expecting to impress anyone with the aural or visual aspects of the game let the gameplay speak for itself and at less than  in many stores its easily one of the better dc bargains available nowmechwarrior fans will lover ring of red because it is very closely related to the game
ring of red is a story about ww not ending with the bombing of japan
the war dragged on and brought in a new style of combat that involved mechs
the gameplay learning curve takes a while to master
once you identify which mechs and squads to match up against oppossing enemy then it becomes very fun
however one thing about this game is that they seemed to cut some elements of the game that should have been there
for example voiceovers the game could have used voiceovers
and they could have used animations thru the breifing stages and small cutscenes
but the game is still fun but reading thru all the dialogue makes me feel like im in front of my old playstation again
but all in all its a great game that may have been rushed to fatten the game market for psthis game is good
its fun to play and the graphics are quite good
i reccommend it
a downside to it is frustrating save function you can save you exact spot in a mission and load it once but if you dont save again and you turn it off or die you have to redo the whole mission not game just the current mission
 poor quality sound just not very good quality
very poor sounding but maybe can be improved by a monster av  or  cable
dont expect sound quality like mgss sound
definetely a must buy from people who love strategy games
has alot of diversity
for further sourcepsm magazine game it an  out of  and awarded it with a bronze must buythis is a good solid turnbased strategy game
you can save the game between missions and you can save the game within each mission
however for a game which is saved within a mission it can only be load up once
in other words you cannot reload multiple times
you can restart from the beginning of the mission just not the middle
this is both good and bad
it makes the game alot tougher and forces you to really think about your moves
i like it
however others may find it frustrating if they are used to reload game over and overit is a military strategy games which revolves around robots afw in his game although the robots are only part of the game
there are military personal accompany these robot
there are  main types of robot and  different types of military personal and you have to decide how to mix and match
for instance you can put an short range antisolider robot with antipersonal soliders togther to make this a super pure antipersonal unit
or you may want to group the antisolider robot with antirobot soliders to make a welladapt battle unit
there is also one unique asepct of this game
it takes a certain time to load the robots weapon and once it is loaded you get to decide the duration for aiming
the shorter the time for aiming the more shots you can fire but you will miss alot
the longer the aiming time the more accurate the shots will be
however if you wait too long then the enemies may hit you first and stunt you and you have to start the entire aiming countdown again
excitingi have played tp asbb and now finally high heat and i have readwell lets just say i have read way too many reviews
none of these games are perfect where one excels the otherssuck
so an informed decision has to me made by the gamer about what is important to you
i couldnt live with the arcade style play and inflated statistics of triple play i couldnt deal with the bizarre ai in allstar but i can live with the greater realism in high heat
yes i wish the graphics and animations were better
thats the reason i shelled out  for ps and it is a great disappointment to me that the first gen baseball games arent better but they arent
so i am going to settle with the game that plays like the real thing and hope for the best next year
also is anybody else besides menotice some of the absolutely terrible spelling etc
in some of these reviews
if a guy doesnt know the difference between quottherequot and quottheirquot what does it matter what he thinks about a video game
a moron is a moroni brought me a copy of high heat baseball and was impressed with its game play
what was disappointing was the way the game graphic jumped around
as a avid gamer i see that this was probaly a rush title
most sports video games are released just before the regular season
i know after playing the pc version the company now has time to focus on improvementsi would like to see a create a player mode as well as a minor league roster a career mode would do wonder for this producti like the fact that you can hit doubles and triples
i like the fact that the computer runs the players that have a high steal rating
the computer also puts on hit and run
just for fun i would like them to add a sequence on which the manager comes out and argues with the umpire and this would add momentum to your team or the computer team
i would like to see that if your fans chant you have a rating boost
i like this title and look forward to playing this in the futurei was amazed by the graphics of triple play baseball on ps
i was dismayed by the gameplay
on the easy setting the game was a jokenot at all realistic
on the normal setting with the computerassisted control feature turned off i couldnt seem to get the players to do what i wanted them to do
just me
or was it the pressuresensitive controls
i dont know and it doesnt matteri took the game back and picked up high heat
this is a much better game for those who want to experience a more realistic baseball simulation
everything tpb didnt have in the control department hh has
its fun and it will satisfy the mlb fan in anyone
the only problem is the graphics which for a ps game are somewhatdisappointing
knowing that quality graphics and incredible gameplay are possible in a ps baseball game we just have to wait for them to come together in the same gamei was skeptical about this game so i rented it first
at first the graphics were a huge turnoff
the players are d but not very defined but the crowd and other objects are  dimensional
simply stated the graphics are terrible for psbut hold your horses
after a few games i was hooked
the game play is great
the pitches are realistic and batting can be difficult at times
the teams are updated with the most recent player acquistions and tradesthe negatives of high heat include   teribble graphicsthe players do not look like they do in real life
the stadiums are not detailed and are missing some intracacies
  you can not sort statistics
you can only sort by team or player name but not by who is leading in a particular category
  no franchise modeall sport games should have a franchise mode
  camera angles switch in the middle of game playthis is very frustrating
when the ball is hit in the outfield sometimes the camera angle changes as you attempt to make a catch or field the ball
this causes you to lose track of the ball and miss it
  hard to control runners
  missing detailsmiss details like having a pitcher warm up in the bull pen before you can call on him
the batter never rushes the mound when he is hit
there is no one in the dugout during game play etcpostives about high heat   great game playthis game for some reason is fun to play
  realistic playthe pitching and batting is pretty realistic
  realistic statisicsthe game accurately compiles batting and pitching statistics for season and playoffs
  many skill levels to keep game challengingas you go up in skill level the game gets much more difficult
the lowest level is good to get accustomed to the controls
  you can play  innings in  minutesi thought it would take a long time to play  innings but the innings go by pretty quickly because there is not a lot of wasted time between pitchesi think this game is a great buy
i have not had the opportunity to play triple play yet but regardless this game is fun
i think it is a great baseball game but needs major improvements before the next version is launchedif you are looking for a ps baseball game to buy then ask yourself this question
do you enjoy a low scoring wellpitched games
do you like situational hitting and working the count
do you like bring in a lefty to get out the opponents lefty slugger
if you answered yes to these questions then high heat is the only way to go
let me point out some things that make this game the most realistic baseball game ever
depending on your pitchers control throwing strikes especially the tough corner ones is not automatic
you can choose to throw down the middle but opponents will tee off on you or you can work the corners but if your pitcher is not a control pitcher like greg maddux then you will walk batters
thus the gameplay revolves strongly around throwing strikes to get ahead in the count as a pitcher or letting certain strikes go and waiting for the mistake pitch out over the plate to drive as a hitter
this is an awesome aspect of the game which baseball players can appreciate
the computers ai is incredible
lets say you are messing around and throw to the wrong base the computer runner will often take advantage of that and take an extra base
never have i seen a game where the computer puts the runners in motion with a full count with two outs
what does that mean
well lets say a runner is on first with two outs and full count and the computer hits a gapper
when you pitch the runner immediately runs because this is what will happen in a real baseball game
so the runner will score
if the count wasnt full the runner most likely will not score
such a situation is indicative of the importance of the whole ball count thing i was talking about
other realistic situations include infield fly rule which prevents your stupid human opponent from dropping a fly ball on purpose to to get cheap double plays when you have runners on  or bases loaded passed balls dropped third strike and throws that are not always right on the money
so if your outfielder throws home depending on their attributes some balls might be frozen ropes to the catcher but more often than not it will take a hop in front of the plate leading to the catcher receiving the ball high and allowing the runner to slide underneath a catchers tag
you can doubleswitch just like they do in the nl
defense is realistic and there are no cheap hits due to poor fielder ai
for instance lets say there is a fly ball right between the shortstop left field and center field
all three fielders will run towards the ball regardless of who you are controlling
so lets say the computer set the initial defender that you are controlling to cf but because you thought you were controlling the ss your initial control was quotupquot causing your cf to move away from the ball
in other games the ball will then drop and the batter might even get a double
not in this game
because your ss and lf were automatically moving towards the ball you can switch off and still make the play
i recently rented triple play and found that the variety of batted ball trajectory was laughable
if i swung on time the ball was hit out for a hr or if i was late the ball would just be slice into the opposite outfield crowd
i think i kept swinging late on a fastball and literally hit the ball to the same section in foul territory about fifty times in a full game
too bad i wasnt sitting at that spot
that is not real baseball
hh features a plethora of different batted ball trajectory such as dribblers line drives to infieders sharply batted balls that can be turned into doubleplays gappers routine popups slices that land on the foul line and head into the corners for exciting triples
i could literally go on for another  pages about the realistic nature of this game
the boxscore is incredible presented exactly in a format like the newspapers
there are stolen bases caught stolen bases errors number of strikesballs thrown per pitcher
strangely you cant sort the stats by category leaders so its hard to tell who is leading the league in hrs or strikeouts
one glaring stat glitch is the games inability to record saves properlynow the warning
if you thought my above descriptions made you say quoti could care lessquot then dont get this game because you will be hugely disappointed by the rudimentary for ps graphics and lack of additional features such as createaplayer home run derby etc
as described in other reviews there is a bullpen glitch which i chose to take out of the equation by turning the pitcher warmup feature off
this game is for real baseball fans only
im in a middle of a season and my record is  with the dodgers
kevin brown is  with an era of  and gary sheffile is batting  with  hrs
in any other game ill bet my record will be  because its so easy for you to take advantage of computer and gary sheffield or your teams slugger will have like  hrs because you can pretty much hit one per game
the realism is thoroughly enjoyable and i am looking forward to a close pennantrace with the giants or the rockies
in other words i wont win my division finishing  games ahead of the nd place team as i have done many times playing asb or triple play on n or psahh baseball
yes it truly is americas favorite passtime
and when someone actually makes a good video gamr out of it im happy as a schoolgirl with cotton candy
and this game is quite good
the games batting system is very realistic
it has yet to be realized realistic physics of how far the ball goes when it hits curtain spots
theres not really that much that you can really say about this game that describes how fun it is
problems with this game are few
the graphics are very poor and it does not use the analog feature
if you have any interest in baseball i think you will enjoy this gamewell ive purchase hh sshh sshhce and hh all for playstation and pc
now im going to be honest the gameplay is much better on pc than playstation
the graphics are alot better and the games run alot smoother
but do came out with hh on ps
i just had to have it
now im not going to lie
if you put this game on rookie its like a walk in the park but if you get the difficulty on the right level
this game will have you on the edge of your seat
i love playing hh baseball that is the reason why i buy some many of their products
but this one for ps has to be the best ive seen
sure they lack ichiro and spencer but theyve substitute that take their place
this game is a must buy for serious gamers
if you love statslike gameplay go purchase this one today
if youre in for the graphics and multioptions stick with tphigh heat  for the psx is a great baseball title
while its not perfect its a sure winner for those who want to stray away from the arcadehomerun heavy games like triple play from eathe game is heavy on the simulation
everything is very realisticdown to players arguing calls and mound visits to the low run scoring games
pither vs batter is done well where tough pitchers are tough to hit and notso great pitchers will be somewhat easier to go up againstwhile this game is one of the best baseball titles out in the market it does have its bad side
first being on the psx youd figure awesome graphics animation and soundnot here
the graphics are psx quality the sound is soso with poor playbyplay and sound effects and the animation is far from being great
stat tracking is not that great either
the main thing i found missing in this game is a batting practice or homerun derby to work on your hitting
hitting in this game is not easy and there is no option or feature to practice your swingswith the minor flaws in the game this is still the best baseball title made for those who want the simulationtype of baseball gameto be honest this is the first baseball game ive played since the first triple play that appeared on the original playstation so naturally i didnt know quite what to expect
now that ive had the game for a while im pleased to say that i am very impressed with this game
the physics are very real with most infield hits resulting in outs except for the really weak ones to third
and unlike most other games ive played a smack off the wall almost never results in a single unless if it was darrin fletcher hitting
still if you want to get really picky you can complain about how difficult it is to get a triple even for cristian guzman
the scores are usually in the  or  range like in real baseball although you do get those  games just as you get those  games as well
the pitching interface is intuitive and easy to learn as is the batting interface
the players in the game act just like the really do  nomar garciaparra has a much easier time making contact than russ branyan luis castillo gets tons of steals etc
the greatest thing about this game is that although it combines many of the smaller nuances of real baseball it is remarkably easy to pick up a controller and get into right away
a inning game has plenty of action as well as lead changes and just whizzes by
you can finish a game season with inning games in surprisingly little time
one thing that freaked me out though is that even though he hit  last year darin erstad was hitting  in the middle of may just like he actually did this year
how did the developers know he was gonna start the season on a stinky note
a couple complaints i have about the game  the statistics interface includes all the stats you could possibly care about and even includes a qualify option but is rather clunky to use the stadium graphics are accurate but a bit blocky the player animations sometimes have some frames missing the announcers can really get on your nerves when they say really obvious points like all he wants to do is get the ball into the outfield  times in the same atbat in season mode humancontrolled teams are never given credit for saves or blown saves most importantly there is no createaplayer feature
i say most importantly because of a few obvious omissions such as ichiro suzuki and strangely enough rick reed
ive tried doing that matt lawton for rick reed trade that happened earlier this year and to my surprise guess who i couldnt find
still these complaints are insubstantial as the gameplay is excellent
its a great player game and an even better player game high heat  is a great baseball game that is fun for people who dont enjoy the sport and awesome for people that do
at the worst its worth a rentalsomeone has finally put out a quality baseball game
unbelievable
all star baseball  and triple play baseball for ps are two of the worst sports efforts in history
i have reviewed both if you care to see what i thought
as for high heat  i had an idea what was coming after sammy sosa high heat   that was a great game with more than a few flaws but almost none in the gameplay or realism aspect
it feels as if do has been working on this game for quite a while
it definitely was not rushed like its competition
first of all the gameplay
the number one reason i rated this game  stars
the gameplay is very quick realistic and has the ability to be suspenseful
you can actually get base hits in this game unlike asb and tp  where you score  runs on  hits with  homeruns
you actually score runs with singles and doubles
your players get doubles and triples
i cant believe i get excited about that because its supposed to be a large part of every game but is nonexistent in the aforementioned
every game just runs together very smoothly
all the annoying little quirks of asb and tp  are gone
when you want the pitcher to pitch he pitches
he doesnt have to go through a series of ridiculous movements and a long windup that puts you to sleep before delivery
its very quick
you can finish a play and almost immediately move to the next play
i cant express how important that is to gameplay
i was extremely bored during both asb and tp becuase of the slow gameplay
not with hh
your baserunners actually move at the speed of the rest of the game
theyre fast
every camera angle allows maximum view
that means if a ball gets past an infielder its the gameplayers fault and not the gameplays
your outfielders can relay very quickly and actually throw out runners at the plate
something has been added that has been missing from every baseball game ever made
there are passed balls wild pitches and even dropped third strikes where the catcher has to recover and throw out the runner at first
the pitcherbatter interface is so great that you can actually tell the difference between a ball and a strike
you can actually take a base on balls in this game run the count full and even make the pitcher react just as he would in real    etc situations
its very similiar to the real past time
ok the graphics
the graphics are really good as is detail but there are some downs to the graphics
once a player gets to the plate every player looks the same
they all have the same build same heighth and the same stupid looking haircuts
they all look like they have s afros sticking out of the back of their helmets
the crowd looks great and even reacts to pressure sensitive situations in the game
they even leave the stadium during blowouts
other than the batters at the plate i dont have any complaints about the graphics
the commentary is spectacular
sometimes a little delayed but still sounds great
now the reason that it lost a star
there is no createaplayer option
why would do discontinue one of the best features ever added to sports games
hh lost a whole star for that fudge
i almost returned the game because of it
i didnt because the overall feel realism and fun factor of the game is so good that a few flaws in the graphics and options are forgivable
maybe theyll get it right next year
if youve been waiting for the best baseball game it looks like they saved the best for last
i highly recommend this game if you are a true fan of the favorite past time and looking for something more than the arcadestyle play of asb and tp
to me the loss of createaplayer mode was a huge blow but did not cripple the play of one of the best sports titles ever releasedwhether it be a book movie or even a video game there are some stories that just stay with you
im talking about those stories that fascinate you so much that you are thinking about it months later and still saying quotwowquot to yourself
eiche kuschs adventure in quotshadows of destinyquot is one of those stories
it is hands down the most fascinating game i have ever playedthe premise  eiche is murdered by an unknown assailant
he is brought back to life by an enigmatic being who calls himself quothomunculosquot and given the opportunity to go back in time to prevent and solve his own murder
but its not quite that simple
having prevented your murder once the killer will strike again prompting you to travel back to another time to prevent it and so on and so on
as eiche travels further back in time to prevent his demise he uncovers dark secrets and insights as to why he is being marked for death in the first place
to say anything more will give it awaythis very unique plot allows for some very nifty timetravelly puzzles especially in the first few chapters
the only problem with the puzzles is that as clever as they are they are very easy to figure out
in some cases you are practically told in giant neon letters what you need to do
its kind of a letdown and i wish the puzzles were a bit harder
but in a way its also a good thing
since the puzzles are easy you can move through the game at a steady pace and they dont get in the way of the storyone of the core criticisms of this game is that you spend more time watching it than actually playing it
this i agree with but i dont think its a bad thing
there is more story here than youd find in most motion pictures and it has richly developed characters who youll find yourself caring about and understanding by the end
i was more satisfied quotwatchingquot this game than i usually am after a typical night at the moviesthere are five paths you can take through the game which lead to five different endings and each path allows you to learn more about the history of the characters you will meet
this sounds like a gimmick but it works
each path with the exception of one allows you to discover a healthy chunk of backstory which is necessary in understanding the whole story
youll discover that the many characters you meet arent just random people but they are tightly woven in a vast conspiracy that goes back to the middle ages
one of the endings contained a plot twist of such sixth senseian proportions that i bolted up in my seat let the controller fall out of my numb fingers and stared transfixed in utter disbelief
if youve played the game you know what ending im referring toanother critique is that the game is too short and yes this is true
even with all the endings the game is still too short
there is alot detail and love put into the story and the characters but theres not enough
i want to know more about these people
i found them all worth knowing more about
although maybe it was just a case of enjoying the story and the characters so much that i wanted morethe sound is a mixed bag
the voices for the most part range from adequate to good
nothing stellar here but they do the job decently enough
the few cases where the acting is strained is when a young person attempts to do the voice of an old person or a child
the voice of hugo was particularly irriratingthere is one aspect of the game that did irritate me though
in order to operate the time travel device eiche needs to power it up with green quotpower cellsquot that are scattered around the town
this was pointless and a real waste of time as the player is forced to run around aimlessly looking for those dang green orbs instead of continuing with the story
this is obviously a poor attempt to please the quotmainstreamquot gamers and it fails miserably
its a small thing to complain about but when a game is so close to perfection faults like this stand out like a mack truckkeep in mind this is a game to satisfy your mind not an itchytrigger finger
there are no life meters no swords or guns or legions of enemies to kill
just your character an interesting story and your brain
you dont quotplayquot this game you experience it
i know that sounds corny but that doesnt make it any less trueshadow of destiny came out on the ps in long before the revival of the popularity of the pointandclick adventure genre on the ds games such as phoenix wright and time hollow which is made by the same guy who made shadow of destiny
after reading some reviews from the time it came out i can see how people felt this game was poor
simply put the pointandclick adventure genre thats essentially the kind of game that shadow of destiny is hadnt regained its popularity yet and a game such as this released on the ps was rather odd for its time
i suspect it wouldve done much better if it were released today on the ds
although i wouldnt say it is a masterpiece its still pretty good
well anyway on to the reviewgraphics score   now lets be honest here
the graphics of this game are not up to the ps standard
of course ive heard that this game was one of the first to come out on the ps and that the graphics were lovely for their time
i dont know if thats true or not but if you compare them to other ps games they lack a bit
the main character eike looks the best
nonetheless all the characters have that blocky look to them and their animation is a bit jerky and exaggerated
its kind of glaring when compared to a game like final fantasy x  of course i imagine that ffx had a much larger budget so its forgivable
as for the environment itself it looks pretty good no real complaints theremusic score  the music is pretty nonnoticeable
its just sort of there in the background and isnt really memorable in any way
it does do a good job of setting the tone and mood for the game
ironically the best song in the game plays during the title screen so you dont hear it  of the time
oh well the music works within its context and isnt obtrusive but it certainly wont cause you to rush out and buy the soundtrack or anything
the voice acting is mostly decent with the exception of eike who sounds like he has no emotions at all and that everything is boring to him
this is really rather odd given the plot of the game but ill discuss that latercharacters score  well all the other characters besides eike have fairly good characterization although most of their personalities are pretty basic
it doesnt really harm the game though since the focus is more on the plot
what does harm the game is eike who really seems to have no personality at all
i think this might be the fault of the voice actor who just injects no excitement into his voice
why is it that when eike is in a lifethreatening situation he sounds bored
he comments on impending danger as though it were a rather dull nature documentary
another problem i have is that he seems to be stupid
he constantly does things and says things that any idiot in his predicament would know not to do or say
even with these problems though the games plot really pulls it along and makes you forget about eikes lack of personalitystory score  this is the major selling factor of this game
the story really shines
it starts out immediately with eike walking along and then suddenly being stabbed in the back and killed
he awakens in an alternate dimension and a creepy person gives him the ability to travel through time to try to prevent his own death
problem is every time he does so he gets killed again at another time
who wants him dead so badly and why
what changes will your meddling in the past have on the present
the story really keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time youre playing this game
plus there are multiple endings
and not crummy multiple endings either each of the five endings is dramatically different and worth seeing and none of them really feel like a bad endingtheyre all equally interesting and satisfying
furthermore once you get all five normal endings you can get two more in the extra game mode
this just gives this game excellent replay value
however haters of cutscenes be warned
this is a very cutscene intensive game which didnt bother me at all but i could see how some people may not like it
you can skip cutscenes which youve already viewed but you cant skip them the first time so if you get a game over you have to sit through them again
im a patient person and it didnt bother me too much but i just thought id mention itgameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
the controls are pretty simple and easy to use and the puzzles arent too complex either
there is a time limit but the game gives you ample time to complete your missions so its not like theres a timer of impending doom present youll often forget its even there
overall gameplay is pretty good but i do have some complaints
first of all the town is massive and it takes forever to run from one end of it to the other
to make matters worse theres really only a handful of buildings which you can enter so most of the town is pointless
they couldve shrunk the map to  of its size and still kept all the important locations intact
also there are really only five npcs wandering the streets at any given time and theres not much to explore besides
so all that makes the town rather tedious to traverse and explore since theres not much to do in it
as a final note the save system is a bit weird
you can only save a permanent file at the beginning of a chapter
you can save a file in the middle of a chapter but once you load the file it erases it
so if the power goes out or you get a game over you must start at the very beginning of the chapter
i guess they did this to keep you from screwing up your game and making it unplayable but its still somewhat annoyingoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
i really liked this game despite its shortcomings
its not a masterpiece or anything but it was fun and i enjoyed playing it
its rather cheap now i got mine for about  so i really recommend getting as its worth having in your gaming collection then shadows of destiny might be for youits held my attention far longer than zoe
or the mgs demo because it does have a very intriguing storylineit has  possible endings actually  but i wont get into that that reveal the big picture which is the true story
be sure to keep the saves to chapters  and  because those are where you ultimately make the decisions that determine what ending you get i like time travel oriented storylines so this was pretty gripping
i find it pretty cool to be able to see the effects of a change in the past
think back to the futurebut the complaints to the game ive read in the reviews so far are pretty valid the game is too easy
yes thats true
most games you die and then you lose
shadows of destiny is more youre supposed to die and then its really easy to get the puzzle solved
and the puzzles arent challenging at all
for instance you get shot
it tells you quotwhy dont you go get something hard like a platequot  yeah hard puzzle i know
however like i said earlier the storyline is fun to watch and even better to decipher once you finish the game
it makes you think and if youre into thinkers pick this upsomeone has a major grudge against eike our hero and wants him dead
lucky for eike he meets a mysterious being with the ability to send eike back in time
then its up to eike what does he change to hopefully prevent his own demise
the killer is relentless so eike is constantly having to come up with ideas
fast
for each quotlevelquot you have a limited ammount of time
this game has excellent characters visual design storyline and  different multiple endings
excellent replay value just to see all the endings that will shock and surprise you
despite being killed all the time its not as scary or gory as resident evil
what makes this game different from any adventure game ive played is you dont get to quothack and slashquot
eike has to use his brain not brawn to thwart his enemy
that may turn off some gamers who like to quotaim and firequot
it disappointed me a little bit that i couldnt simply hack my enemybut then again the enemy is a mystery until you reach the end
a truly unique game experience
i felt the game was a bit short
but the multiple endings make up for iti first rented and played winback for the nintendo   since koei the makers of the popular strategy series romance of the three kingdoms had never made a shooter before i wasnt expecting much but though it wasnt a great game it was fairly good
now koei has released winback on the playstation  and theyve even added a few thingsthe graphics in this winback have been updated from the n version as you might expect they dont take advantage of what the ps can handle but they do look a lot better than before
music isnt great either but it does fit the games situations and when you take damage and are near death the music changes and becomes faster to express the urgency
the story in winback kind of reminds me of the movie the rock some madman acquires the use of a powerful weapon and you and several other special forces units are sent in to attempt a forceful recovery of the weapon before it is put to use
depending on how fast you are and how few times the weapon strikes you will receive one of three endings
the story could have been better if the characters were developed but they werent so every time a character is killedand they are killed a lotyou dont really carethe oneplayer story mode in winback is pretty simple
it is divided into  stages where you basically move forward by eliminating enemies
puzzlesolving is limited to involving the player in finding the key to a locked door or destroying the source of a laser trap that blocks the way
the rather dry simplicity of the gameplay however is made more enjoyable by the variety of moves you can perform
imagine yourself with your back against the wall of some building
you slide along the wall come to its end and carefully peek around the corner
an enemy
you remain calm and check your surroundings
from where you stand you can only see a lone crate that may be of help
suddenly you swing around the corner blast a couple shots at the baddy and make a mad dash for the cover of the crate
by now the enemy notices you and has his gun aimed in your direction
youve almost reached the crate when you hear his gun go off but a quickly executed somersault barely saves you from the fast approaching bullets
keeping your head down behind the crate you wait until the firing stops
finally silence
the enemy must be out of ammunition and in the process of reloading
you take this advantage and come out from hiding prepared to take down the enemy
but as soon as youre about to take your shot you spot two enemy reinforcements coming to their partners aid
thats when you see it
a crate filled with explosives right in the midst of the enemies
you pump it full of lead and watch the explosion as it sends your enemies to their feet
its moves like these that make the game come alivein winback there are two battle modes to choose between versus mode and bot mode added from the previous n version
versus is a battle that can be played by  human players in one of nine arenas in any of six different modes of play
among these modes two worth mention are death match and cube hunt
the first is standard fair for multiplayer shooters each players objective is simply to eliminate the other players
in cube hunt each player must collect seven different colored cubes taking damage means losing a cube which the player will then have to find over again
bot mode is only  or  players and is played the same way as a game of death match except that there can be computercontrolled characters and there are always two teams
you can play this mode by yourself against an army of bots or you can play on a team of bots against another team of bots
two players playing bot mode can play against each other with an assortment of bots on both their teams or they can work together on the same team with or without bots against a team comprised solely of bots
sadly bot mode only has five arenas but they are different from the nine you can choose from in versus mode and a couple are fairly large
also it should be noted that there are a good deal of options to customize your battles from adjusting the strength of weapons to changing the difficulty of bots you can even choose from over  characterswinback may not be a metal gear solid but for koeis first attempt in the genre it isnt bad
probably the worst thing in winback is the artificial intelligence especially in story mode
an enemy confrontation typically unfolds as follows you swing out from behind a wall and draw the bad guys attention you then swing back behind the wall for cover and watch the enemy stupidly discharge a magazine of bullets at the spot where your head was a second ago a real person placed in the computers shoes would next either close in and destroy you or seek cover for himself but the sick ai continues to stand there like a sitting duck until a couple more stolen shots around the corner have finished him off
this isnt to say the game isnt a challenge the enemies unnatural actions just make it seem a little silly
still winback is a good game and is probably one of the best that you can get for the ps to date
if you already have the n version this is just one to rent but if you dont this is a solid buywinback takes the player through the heart racing adventure of jeanluc cougar a member of the elite antiterrorist squad scat as he  his team attempt to stop a terrorist group called the crying lions from using a space sattelite to blow up random spots on earth
but did his team bite off more than they can chew
ill start off by saying this game is wicked repetitive but it is fun
to start off your main weapon the handgun has unlimited ammo and will quickly force you to choose it as your weapon of choice
you run around as jean doing rolls aiming with the r and firing with the x buttons pressing up against crates  walls for cover flicking switches blowing up laser boxes shooting more terrorists een though you are heavily outnumbered usually  or  against one and collecting the very small array of generic weapons  a shotgun an assault rifle and a silenced handgun
oh you also get a flashlight later in the game dont know if i should mention thatthere is a bot challenge mode where you run around depending on the challenge either alone or with a computer controlled bot and fight off other teams of bots
i believe there is  challenge missions
whatever
as you beat them you unlock characters to use in multiplayer mode
hah multiplayer mode is where the real fun is at
you and if you have the multitap adapter  friends can go either toe to toe in a free for all or a team match in a variety of stages where anything is cover and you can jump over railings and what not
its really funsadly the enemies attack patterns are bland and very predictable
you pop out from cover shoot two or three times take cover again and the enemies shoot once or twice then stop and stand there as you jump out from cover and repeat the whole process again
unfortunatley the aiming system doesnt really help out in a lot of spots
lets say there is a guy standing on a ledge above you who poses the biggest threat and there is a guy below you  more than once i found myself jumping out thinking i was going to aim at the ledge man only to find my gun pointed at the ground guy
sure you can manually aim but by the time you begin raising your handgun or whatever up you have already been shot once or twice
youll hit them only if your lucky or youll die firstwhat i thought was really cool in winback was the fact that you ran into your entire team as you progress in the game and almost all of them die in some brutal way or another but after witnessing their deaths you the player feel you must avenge them
take the guy law who after forcing you to go onto an elevator alone because enemies were coming and he insisted he would slow you down fights  kills all the terrorists after sustaining a few more wounds then as he sits down to recoup cecile one of the main enemies comes and caps him right in the head
or take mike hawkins the fat ponytailed demolitions expert in scat who opens an elevator and catches a whole clip of rounds by a boss right in front of your eyes
although there is no blood and the enemies blink  dissapear as if it was on the nes system the game is pretty violent and really helps add realism to the gamethe voice acting takes away from the realism of the game sadly
there is almost no emotion in any of the characters exept the generic terrorists who scream stop
or hold it
jeanluc in particular sounds unenthused and straight up bored in every cut scene
i guess i cant say too much figuring ns winback had no voices just dialouge boxes
however the music although many dont like it sounds pretty good
it is a sort of an eerie techno beat which i guess helps add darkness and hart pounding sensations to the atmospheregenerally speaking the graphics are alright
the character models of the scat members look really good  smooth compared to winbacks ns release
the stages are massive and pretty detailed with graffiti sprayed around and boxes and ladders and stuff scattered around did i mention the levels were massive
the terrorists look pretty interesting but look good all the same
however some of the bosses look lame  like this big diesel guy with a huge  caliber machine gun and a purple shirt
come on nowill tell you straight up this game is hard and pretty long  missions with only a handful of checkpoints scattered in each level
boss fights are hard where just like in spartan total warrior youll fight the boss in a small room while fending off against a bunch of other average terrorists while avoiding exploding barrels or lasers
other times youll enter a narrow hallway with two large windows on your right and left and as you walk into the room enemies come pouring in behind you to your sides and in front of you and all you have to use as cover is speed rolling and a single box
oddly if you take too long or take too much damage it actually effects the ending
my ending for this ps release was garbage  my entire team got killed except the geek keith
jeanluc  keith stand on a helipad waiting for a chopper above them to evac them outta there
winback mission complete
once you beat the game depending on your score and what difficulty you played it on you can unlock max power mode which is basically infinite ammo for each gun or trial mode where you pick a level and run through it as fast as you can to test your speedto finish this lengthy review i am going to suggest if you like shooting things are a fan of the n version or simply want to see how your entire team dies then play through winback covert operations atleast once
although hard the game can be  is a fun interesting experienceaclaim sports finaly introduced the allstar baseball series to playstation
they fully succeeded in bringing a quality game to the system whcih is capable of so much
why only  stars
simply because the great graphics arent taken advantage of because there is only one angle to chose from
now im sure you all already knew that but im just reinforcing the fact that this needs to be changed because the graphics cant seem to get any better
they totally took advantage ofwhat ps has to offer
also the gameplay is superb
in tpb you win games  on  homeruns
fun for awhile but for a real baseball and sports video game fan it doesnt cut the mustard
when i started winning and losing games from a variety of    i became extremely happy
numbers of players are also extremley accurate
in a season you dont end up hitting  homers at the all star break
i love the realism in this game it really makes it worth the money
overall i really enjoy this game and was surprised that acclaim has become able to put out a quality game like this
peace outfor the most part its a pretty cool game the graphics are awsome
the sound is excellent
pretty easy to figure out
the only big downside of the game is there should be more camera angles and they should have had the same player control that was offered in the n version
i thinks the n controls where easier to use
besides for that the game is very fun to play
it feels just like being there
maybe in allstar  they will fix those problems and maybe add a more detailed creat a player
then the game will be perfect
i do recomend this to all baseball fanswith the baseball season in full swing i decided to test the baseball market on ps
i found out that triple play bothered me with its sluggish gameplay so i tried all star
i found a solid baseball game with a lot of depth
team mascots accurate batting stances and easy to pick up fielding and pitching controls
even with the difficulty set on rookie it was a challenge
even if i am beat i am in awe of how solid it is
grant it when you field the ball it could be  ft away but he will come up with it but with such minor flaws does it really matter
the commentary will leave you speechless and the extra animations will keep you interested for hours
until something better comes along this is the best baseball game on the psi read all of the reviews on all three baseball games so i decided to give this one a try and triple play a try
i bought both of them
i started to play tp and it was alright
then i started to play asb
it was a whole lot better than tp
the graphics are awesome
gameplay is great
and the controls are really easy
it is really a competitive game with the computer
the first time that i played iton rookie of course the computer was kicking my butt
then after a while i started hitting home runs like they were nothing
then i moved up one more level and it is just like your playing a real season none of this winning all but  games for the whole season
see im really into getting beat a lot to make it seem real
and on the veteran level that is perfect
i dont win  in a row i win maybe  and then lose a couple
it is great
you can throw people out on your knees rob someone of a home run st baseman jumping for a bad throw or scooping up one too
the only reason that i gave this game  stars instead of  is that when you are going for a ground ball or fly ball is that you can get the ball when your an inch or twoon the tv away from it
its a really nice game
i recommend that you rent all three and find out for yourselfi am going to make this short and sweet the baseball games on the ps this year are definitely below the caliber that they should be and triple play and allstar were two big dissapointments to medont get me wrong asb has good graphics and gameplay but there are little things wrong in every part of the game that make you feel like your not playing a ps gamefirst of allfielding is nearly impossible with some of the camera angles that they give you and it doesnt even look like they catch the ballthose are my two major gripes about the gameotherwise the graphics and gameplay will make you feel like your at the ballparkto conclude if you want the graphics and the top quality brand namebuy triple play baseballbut if you really dont care and want a very realistic baseball game to enjoy then maybe you should check out allstar baseball i once tried the game mobile suit gundam zeonic front and it was quite good if not complicated and difficult
but zone of the enders puts that game to utter shame
the powers and weapons that you receive for the orbital frame giant robot are awesome and the way it moves is incredible
you gain control of the orbital frame called jehuty and you basically battle against a whole bunch of other orbital frames
most of them arent that challenging at first but later the enemies receive upgrades and become considerably tougher
the leaders are a whole other storythere are about  other orbital frames that jehuty must face off against tempest tyrant nebula neith and finally anubis
tempest and tyrant are very large and powerful and nebula is kind of like a huge jet orbital frame
neith and anubis however are very similar to jehuty bipedal very fast powerful etc
the story of the game which is quite good revolves around a young boy named leo stenbuck who lives in a space colony outside of jupiter called antilia
after he accidentally gains control of jehuty he has to deliver the machine to the people who created it in order to keep an invading army of orbital frames from acquiring it
leo then meets up with his remaining friend celvice and along with jehutys ai system codenamed ada faces off against the invading army while also defending innocent civilians from destructionanother good thing about this game is the controls
they are very easy to remember and are not complicated at all
the only thing you should know is that to use the special weapons you acquire throughout the game all you have to do is press the circle button the game doesnt really tell you how to do that unless you read the manual
jehuty is much more powerful than any zaku or gouf you may control in those gundam games and is not nearly as difficult to control
the only thing i dont like about this game is how you have to go back and forth basically all the time in order to accomplish missions and sometimes you might find yourself wandering about thinking what was i supposed to do
or where do i look for that program
as long as you keep your cool and read the objectives and hints listed in the mission area of the pause menu then youll do just finenow i plan on getting zone of the enders the nd runner since the ending of this great yet extremely short game kind of leaves you hanging
chiaothis game is great
it has outstanding graphics and easytouse controls
it may not be the longest game in the world i beat normal mode in  hours but after you beat it a versus mode is unlocked which gives it high replay
if you just want a good challenge start a game on very hard or play versus against a high level pc while you are on a low level
this game combines mech combat a tiny bit of puzzle solving and rpg elements making this game very active and fun
the music is somewhat hypnotizing and never gets repetetive
i would definately reccommend this game to mech combat fans as well as newcomers to the genreps dont buy this for the metal gear demo
the demo may be good but remember that it is only a demo worth maybe i admit it i got this game for the mgs demo regradless of what the actual game had to offer
but when i stopped playing the demo and put in the zoe disc i found a great game
the graphics are just plain gorgous
you can blow up just about anything but i dont recomend it because you get a lower score if you do
the sound is also great but the voice acting isnt
its not terrible but it just sounds like the actors are just reading it and not putting any fealing into it
it doesnt sound like the charactors are actually talking
the gameplay is fairly simple
you fly around shooting at the other robots make sure you dont hit any of the buildings and dont get killed
the control is very well placed on the dual shock and it makes it very easy to control which is good since there will be a lot of multiple eneimes
when youre fighting theres a very helpful zelda like lock on which makes killing things a breeze
ok now for the bad stuff
the story is probebly the worst part of the game
its very short and simple
i was expecting it to be like a metal gear solid story where theres lots of plot twisting and it always keeps you interested
in zoe i didnt really care what was going to happen to leo
hes too much of a wimp to be a hero
the girl seemed more confident than he did
voices as i said before were not that great
but at least they made an effort
since the story is not so great it kind of makes you not want to play it anymore but its still kind of good
i love the multiplayer feature thou
its the first game ive seen in a long time where you dont have to have split screen
and if you dont think this game sounds all that great than the mgs demo is certantly worth your money
now that game is incredibleimagine gundam or robotec and how fast the fighting is and you get zo
you are in a frame that is as powerful as those machines and it keeps getting better
this game starts and ends amazingly
first off
the powers you have to begin with are cooler than any weapon you get in the game
you can fly and you dont have to worry about ammo or how long you can fly you just can
i cant say enough thats good about this game
you can blow up buildings throw energy bursts grab enemies and punch them across the level
and the reaction time is amazingone bad thing the areas you fight in are confined to one area at a time they arent small however they seem like they could be bigger
ive won the game on every difficulty and unlocked verses mode not that you have to do that to unlock vs mode you only have to beat it twice to unlock the full vs mode which isnt the best but you can play as all of the tough boss with or without a second player
get iti think the editorial review did a good job of summarizing this game
i am not going to repeat what was in that review except for the visuals are absolutely stunning
it is the most visually stunning game ive seen so far for the pshere are a few things the other reviewers did not quite make clear about the game the way the game merges the tutorial into the game play is excellent and it is one of the best ive seen
it very quickly immerses you in the game
the ending is not an ending
it opens the game up to a sequel
if you accept that then the ending wont be as jarringly abrupt as it was
the boy hero is really whiny
but you have to endure the whine since the hints for the next mission are imbedded in the cut scenes
after a while the story and melodrama does grow on you but abruptly ends with the ending of the game
this game is well worth a rental and should take you maybe  or  hours to complete
the replay value is low
once you go thru the game there isnt a whole lot left to do
the  player mode isnt that interesting
the game is really more like an interactive story rather than a video game
you spend almost as much time in the story cutscenes as you do in the game
buy this game if you like collecting games like one for each genre
zoe is a good one for covering the animemechs genre as it really does an excellent job visuallyi wasnt a mechshooter genre fan until i bought this game
its amazing the graphics are beautiful and the sound equally matches the graphics
it has a great story and it has to be the best game to date graphic wise better than the bouncer evenhowever the game does not come without bad points
first the sounds except for explosions are really bad and its voice acting only gets worse the more you hear it
the game is great for the first few hours but redundant enemies objectives and landscapes eventually wear on you to the point that the measly five to seven hours it takes to complete the game seems too longthis is a great game and you should get it too even if you are not a mech game genre fan this may have what it takes to turn you aroundwhat is the japanese obsession with teenage boys saving the world
seriously
its unrealistic
sure its a robot game
but think of it as a future game
in the future little kids would be able to defeat army people
i doubt it
this game was fun and pretty and cool
but it was short and kind of repetitivethat is what zone of enders will always be referred to
i find this incredibly sad because zone of enders is truly a solid game
its fun visually stunning and nothing like weve ever played before except in the arcades
but i know tons of people buying this game solely to play the mgs demobut konami already knew thatanyway zone of enders is a very easy game with what is supposed to be an indepth storyline
unfortunately the storyline is about as indepth as say quotthe bouncerquot and it leaves you hanging
the motivations for some of the actions to the characters were quite pathetic and even annoying at times
the only voiceacting i thought was solid was ada who was monotonous anyway
everyone else was just annoying
regardless the game is fun to play and look atnow the metal gear solid  demo its pretty incredible
you only play one level which can actually be finished in under  minutes but theres a lot more to do in the level than just finish it
if youve never played metal gear solid before the controls take some getting used to but once you do its incredibly funsome of the effects you run into during the game are incredible
you can see the individual hairs on the characters faces
when people shoot you and youre against a wall blood splatters on the wall
when theres a pool of blood and you step in it you leave blood footprints for a while and the enemy can see it and sound an alarm
you can take an enemy hostage and drag him around and not get shot at
you can surprise an enemy and point a gun at his head or at his groin and hell give you stuff like health
you can have your back up against a wall and you can tap the wall to call attention to the guard
you can search people and shove them in rooms and even lockers once youve knocked them out
you can shoot pipes and fire extinguishers to temporarily blind enemies if you smoke your health slowly goes down
i was walking in the rain  and i stepped inside and the guard saw my wet fotoprints
and the way it shows you is through a little popup pip window that shows you what the guard sees its cool just some incredible stufftheyre not even done with the game yet
you should be excited by nowwhen you first put this game in after the opening scene if you are familiar with metal gear solid you can tell that the game is made by the same people
after the first battle in the game you are just like wow
after the action stops you want more you get more
the controll is great
the sound is great
story is great
why did i only give it  stars
the game is so short i cant believe it
thair better be a sequil to carrie on the story further more
as for the mgs demo all the more reason to warrent a purchasezone of the enders is a great game even though i only bought it for the demo of metal gear solid   zone of the enders has some of the best graphics that i have seen on playstation   you are leo and you take control and pilot a giant orbital frame to battle against giant mechs in this fast and furious action game
try it in the shop and im sure that you will buy this gamei am sure that numerous players purchased zone of the enderszoe
for short for both zoe
and the demo of metal gear solid sons of liberty mgs
i on the other hand not only didnt care ifi got the msg demo i never actually bothered to play the msgdemo
as of this writing my msg demo still has yet to see the insideof my ps
so naturally this review is solely for thezoe
gamei was nervous about purchasing zoe
since i had heardabout the complex controls of the game and in the past any game thathad overly complex controls generally didnt survive long in mycollection not because the controls were complex per se but becausethe game programmers tend to forget to allow gamers full customizationof those controls
not only were the controls of zoe
a surprisebut this game has the most intuitive controls since the days of supermario bros the game splashes you right down into the controls of theorbital frame quotjehutyquot most fans will think of it as amech robot or something similar depending on their favoriteuniverse in the beginning the control buttons are minimized to themost basic functions for close combat distance fighting andmovement
as the game progresses the jehuty picks up or learns newabilities and teaches you how to use them
just as you grasp theconcepts and fine controls of the jehuty the lessons stop
not a badthing really since i never noticed that the lessons had stoppedsince my attention was focused on fightingfor every single game ihave ever played i was always able to spot ai
deficiencies in thegame
most game programmers never could get the ai
just right forthat quotreal worldquot feel
and yet for the first time sincehalflife zoe
s ai
is so subtle and finessed that i never oncenoticed any ai
faults my first time through
that in itself isvery impressive in my eyes
i never noticed the first time that theenemies rarely quotgangquot up on you in close range
if yourefighting one machine in close combat then the other machines tend toattack you with long range weapons as opposed to also attacking inclose range
this makes the game that much more fun
never once did iexperience frustration due to being overwhelmed by too manybaddies
and when i wasnt worried about the baddies i sure as heckwas taking in the scenerythe detail in each scene and thenumerous small details make this game a pleasant jot through a gameworld
things explode burn and interact just like a real worldshould
usually its safe to use a building as cover however be awarethat the enemies will either go around the building or blow thesuckers up to get at youand yet for all the destruction detailand awesome control the game seriously lacks one key thing
length
ispent quite a bit of time flying around since i never could quiteremember what i was supposed to do next
but even with the extra timewasted doing nothing i estimate that the actual game time to bewithin hours
i wish game designers would guarantee at least a fortyhour game the first time through
my first time through just barelyreached half that my second time cut those hours to less than halfthe time of my first game
the ending comes as a shock really oneminute i was wondering how i was going to control jehutys possiblenew powers and how the next mission was going to resolve itself whenthe credits started to roll
just when the game story really starts tobecome interesting
what a disappointment
the games abrupt endingwas such a shock that i played through a second time to obtain aperfect score thinking that maybe that doing so would unlock the restof the game
i even waited until all of the credits passed by
zipnothing nada
the game has no quotsecretquot that i couldfindin essence i wish that zoe
didnt come with the msg demoand instead came with a second cd for the rest of the game
oh wellperhaps with the release of msg that it might come with a demo forzoe
the game is really sweet but the high  as of thiswriting makes admission a little tough to swallow
it really makes nosense to purchase this game just to play the msg demo
if gamersliked the original metal gear solid enough i am positive that mostgamers will buy msg regardless of the demo
if you like the conceptof giant mech warriors beating the tar out of each other then by allmeans purchase this game
on the other hand if you just want to buythis game for the msg demo then you must either be a collector orhave a lot of cash to burnwatching the colony you live in as its besieged and subsequently obliterated and seeing your friends bound begging and then dying a fairly horrific death in front of your youthful eyes all in the same day may be too much of a punctuation mark for some but for leo its just the beginning
after finding himself fleeing for dear life from an invasion force bent on finding a specific orbital frame giant robot and taking control of it to further their own sinister plans he stumbles upon jehuty a stateoftheart war machine with perks that everyone seems to be after
stranger still he finds his way inside this wondrous killing machine and begins piloting it doing a fairly good job in the process and saving his own with your help of course skin
this starts something that will before its done lead him down some strange pathways hopefully saving the colonies he sees being destroyed all about him and humanity itself by getting this frame to marsthere are some pros and some cons housed within the gameplay of zone of the enders some adding a bit of playtime bliss to the experience and a few that are frustratingly redundant in their repetitive approachespros the thing i find myself most impressed with is the way the combat is initiated and with the  degrees of movement that you can use while engaging other frames
it differs from the simple updownleftright motions that many games use when they let you maneuver above ground level and it comes in handy when surprising the increasing number of enemies you happen across
i also like the fact that there are additions provided off and on for jehuty giving you some weapons to play with while drudging through the monotony of killingthe boredom of some of the duller missions
you also have enemies that increase in level as you progress throughout the game not really providing you with any challenges but at least providing you with varying amounts of resistance when you wade into themcons one of the most annoying things about the game is that its a bit vague when it comes to what it wants you to do on missions
sometimes this will lead to wandering about for no reason causing you to fight enemies youve fought before for no other reason than you being lost and making you see the same things over and over again
still if it werent for that the shortness of the game would be even more pronounced letting you coast through it in a fraction of a night that it should take
another problem i have with the mission status of the game is that you are constantly returning to areas youve cleared only moments before basking in the same scenery youve seen multiple times to find things that werent available to you when you first went through them
despite the wonderful looking background effects and building that can be blown to cinders during battles sometimes leading to human casualties this repetitive action somewhat bogs the progressiveness of your adventure down
lastly there are those enemies that seem to come in flocks dying almost as fast as they spar with you leaving you wanting the bosses or the upgraded frames that you should fear but really cant bring yourself toall of that said i would still say that this game is fun for people who like their mechs highly operational and extremely mobile as well as for fans of z o e  when all is said and done it isnt that bad of a ride  considering the duration only lasts eight hours tops
for this reason i gave it a high rating and also placed a warning with it telling you to perhaps check it out before engaging in any sort of commitmentquota colony hijack
youre our last hopequot  a dramatic action adventure game in which you feel and experience the spectacular story while fighting the enemy in space with jehuty  a gigantic humanoid weapon quotorbital framequot

leo cannot deny that he has thought that quotnow that these guys are gone id never get bullied againquot he then blames himself for not being able to save them
he panics andempire earth could have easily been called age of empires  since the gameplay is so similar
as is typical with such games resource collection building institutions and creating units is the bulk of gameplay
there are several ways to customize the game including your choice of maps civilizations number of enemy civilizations and so forth
one really good thing is that resources dont get depleted throughout the game except for wood
that is i was mining that same gold mine in epoch  as i was at the beginning of the game
also new units such as the hospital prophets wonders and firearms add some interesting gameplay elements
ive only played the game once for  hours straight
and was defeated in the th epoch rennaissance
by computer opponents who ganged up on me before i could maintain my  wonders for  years
one thing that i noticed was that the gameplay is slow largely due to the huge amounts of resources that you have to collect to advance through the ages
also the enemy ai is clever and ruthless even on the easiest difficulty setting
as with the age of empires games diplomacy is a weak part of the game also there is no market for trading
overall i liked the gameplay but i dont recommend trying to play through all  epochsyou can choose to limit the number you playunless you dont mind playing the same game for daysgraphics are decent
you can zoom in and out but probably will not find a need to do so very often
they are an improvement over the graphics of the age of empires games but not much
the music is okay and the specialeffect sounds are nice
the villagers speak in english regardless of their civilization
if you enjoy strategy games or are a fan of the age of empires games as i am you should like empire earth
however in my opinion this game is not the classic that these other games are because of its lack of originality and rather slow pacesometimes older games can be more addictive then latest photo realistic battle royalethe game is a standard rts game where you civilization evolves from prehistoric up to a nano age
the game is quite addictive since it doesnt use an overly complex set of unit behaviors and left to them selves most units can handle enemy recon and scout probesthe game has priests that can convert enemy units great when you can get an entire battleship to convert and defect and prophets who can bring on plagues quakes fire storms and such
a boat full of well place prophets can save your butt if the ai team sudden advances to wwii tech while youre still driving around on horsesthe stock maps are kind of bland but there are hacks for the game that make the maps more random
max sized random island maps are funpopulation and resource management are pretty simple
the civs dont need infrastructure homes increase morale but arent need for population
no long supply lines etcbeing an older game you can run it with multiple ai enemies  units and no lag
only glitch is that game will crash if you task switch or accidentally hit the windows  buttonhistory fans rejoice  empire earth takes the basic concept from age of empires and extends it from the dawn of time all the way to modern times and beyond
never have i gotten such a sense of the march of technology and a true arms race against an enemy  this game has over  units from every era in history including prehistoric the bronze age middle ages napoleonic both world wars modern times and beyondrobots and time travel
you can play through history or focus on one period in time each epoch is a complete balanced game in itself and there are  of them total
in fact empire earth is so similiar to age of empires that you might wonder if the same people made both games  and youd be right the lead designer was the same
the interface units sound fxs even resources are all very similar to the age of games
thats a good thing unless you are burned out on aoethis game is entirely about combat so dont come expecting a realtime version of civilization   there are  campaigns but the real fun is in the multiplayer and computer skirmishes
in these games you can either choose a tournament game in which both sides rush through hundreds of years of technology or a more focused game with only a few eras of advancement say from ww to ww
whatever you choose you can set the starting era and the ending one
a great touch is that all maps are randomly generated and theyve included a wide assortment of maptypes to fit your style  islands plains mountains mediterrians inland seagameplaywise nothing much is new here  you still must micromanage your town and economy and send troops blindly at the enemy if you hope to win
where ee is different from the rest is that it has so many upgrades to its basic units  infantry advances from cavemen to laser shooters  and some basic types are eventually outdated like archers and cavalry eventually are replaced with tanks and rifles
the march of time is merciless you must win the arms race to win the game so the sheer need to constantly research is something new that could not be experienced in any other gamei was surprised one game when the computer probed my lines with a balanced assortment with units and after i had a hard time eliminating the catapults it sent an army of  siege engines and utterly wiped me out
the computer actually learned from my tactics and changed itself accordingly
it changes its attacks pretty regularly actually which is a nice change from the ai in some rts games which seem to be able to do all things perfectly at once
the ai in empire earth attacks like a game of chess moving one thing first then another attacking you but leaving itself open for counterattack afterwards
the give and take in this game is very saticfyingthe graphics are d and can seem kinda bare until you witness hundreds of units on the screen at once and realize everything in this game is kingsized
i liked the scope of the technology but wished for more of a civilizationtype tech tree in which one advance leads to the next
as the game is now the player simply researches a new epoch and once heshe gets there they are granted access to build anything and everything in it
nice but it tends to make opponents very similiar
otherwise a great gameprobably the best thing about this game is the amount of variety it offers
because it spans such a long period there is an amazing array of units to choose from as well as a massive tree of upgrade options
for this reason alone i find myself playing it over and overanother of the games strengths is the unit balance system
since especially in the early game every unit has a corresponding unit which is very effective in countering it early rushes become much more difficult
it also means that most units in the game are useful unlike many strategy games where you can be content with building only one or two unit typesthe ai is challenging  perhaps too much so at times  though not perfect
occasionally if you hit a computer opponent hard enough it will essentially give up even if it has the resources to rebuild
still though playing against the computer will probably keep you entertained for a while and prepare you to play against other peoplethe only reason im not giving this game a  star rating is that it doesnt really offer anything innovative
it takes the best elements of popular rts games and combines them together quite well but if youre looking for a unique experience you wont find it here
however if you like rts games in general empire earth will give you more and i mean a lot more of the elements you already loveeven though i prefer turnbased games to realtime ones i thouroughly enjoy this game
ive had absolutely no technical problems with it nor have i run across anything i could call a bug
this is a welldesigned wellprogrammed very good game
after several weeks the only thing ive found that id like improved is the ability to have groups of units explore together
as it is you can manually move a grouped set of units to another location though they ignore any speed differences but you cant click the explore button on that group and have them go enmass around the screen
instead they individually go off on their own
a minor quibblethis is a great game
my favorite part is that it got rid of that anouying problem where every five minutes you had to stop midbattle and go replinish the farms
a game where you can go from prehistory to postpresant is a game worth checking out
a definate must buythis game might be called quotempire earthquot but in all reality its the next bold installment in the quotage of empiresquot saga
while it sports a different name and a new home sierra the lead designer of quotagesquot has done much more than make a mere sequel
while aoe was the next logical step from aoe historically and technically empire earth takes a giant leap forward encompassing all aspects of human history and even takes a stab at the future which is a little depressing considering there are only a couple of ages after the modern age
are they trying to tell us something
the interface is basically the same as aoe with many of the same old buttons and features but the graphics are now d and it allows you to take your perspective all the way to the ground to get an upclose view of your troops your buildings and the combat in progress
the d graphics really do make a huge difference in visual quality
i was never really disappointed with aoe or s d stuff but now im spoiledthe scope of the game eclipses the aoe series so completely that there really is no going back for me
while both the previous games only had  quotagesquot each empire earth gives us  total quotepochsquot to play in
imagine starting in the stoneage with cave men tossing stones and beating each other to death with clubs then potentially transcending to a future where giant mechs wreak havoc and cyborgs rule the earth
my personal favorites are in the quotatomic eraquot which includes ww ww and the modern erawith  eras to play in there are hundreds of units to build
advancing to the next epoch can make all the difference between victory and defeat
while most of the eras prior to ww offer new versions of old favorites cavalry archers siege weapons etc
the atomic ages offer aircraft and the game takes a real leap forward
theres something special about building a fleet of aircraft carriers parking them in a safe spot launching dozens sometimes hundreds of fs like a huge swarm then sending in a squadron of bs or bs to drop nukes on your enemy
airports and carriers work a little differently from other units relying heavily on waypoints which can take some getting used toothe future ages present yet another level with cybernetic units
in the quotnanoepochquot the last age of the game you can build  different types of mechs all with their own distinct advantages and disadvantages
of course there are also futuristic versions of all the previous units to play with as wellive been playing this game religiously for a little over a week and ive only begun to scratch the surface
ive yet to play all the epochs and there are some units i havent even seen yet
i havent even begun any of the historical campaigns yet
playing any one epoch is worth the price of the game and can stand on its own as a quality product
with  epochs the variety seems almost endlessone thing worth mentioning is the difficulty of the game
amazon mentions it in their review and i must agree
ive been playing the aoe series since the day the first one came out and im fairly decent at them but empire earth is kicking my 
even set to quoteasyquot this is a very complicated game
the computer seems to take advantage of its ability to multitask something that i can only try to keep up with
the skirmishes seem to take hours to finish and often i find myself being defeated after hours of play
it can be a little frustrating at first but if youre not afraid of a real challenge with extremely dynamic gameplay this one is for you
a must buy for any old age of empires fanempire earth is just the game to dethrone such heavy weight strategy games such as age of empires ii and starcraft
this game resembles age of empires ii
the difference between the two games can be found in that this game spans the historical battles through  years whereas age of empires ii only spans  years
this game represents historical accuracy from the battle at waterloo napoleon and to wwi red baron
there is even a battle at normandy you know from saving private ryan with all those tank blockades on the beach and the pillboxes
although this game has only one view a side view it is d modeled and there is a zooming function
the gameplay is smooth and the graphics are nice
there are so many civilizations that can be built in multiplayer mode you can choose countries and also upgrade upon weapons and civilization options utilizing the civilization points
in multiplayer you can even create your very own civilization from scratch and even build playable campaigns build enough of the scenarios and it can be a new game
first person games tend to be quite short  with four different campaign civilizations to choose from german english greece and russia
there are  levels for each campaign
the german campaigns take place from wwiwwii
the english campaigns take place between th century  th century
the greece campaigns begin from stone age and the russian campaign begin from the digital age of    years later in the nano agea player can build heroes for each different era during gameplay
some of the greater moments in this game is the ability to build aircraft and aircraft carriers even stealth bombers that carry nukes and to later upgrade them once you reach a new epoch or era such as digital age to nano age
there are too many tanks mechs soldiers fighter and bomber planes and naval ships to even begin to list them all they all change when you reach a newepoch
this game is a must buy for serious strategy pc gamers if you are somebody who loves to cheat there are currently no cheat codes for the single player mode but there are cheats for multiplayer mode
buy this game if you love the age of empires games but are starting to grow tired of playing themgameplay  graphics  sound  value  empire earth is one of the those games that keeps calling you back for moreyou pick the timeline you pick what culture youwant to play and then beat your enemy to the groundgood pointszoom up close to the action replay value is good and timeline is bigbut not all is gold music is forgettable no unique unitlike aok and some of the bulidings have the same look to thembut if you liked aok and played it to death then by all meansget empire earththere is nothing new here its like aok onlya longer timelinethe game is very in dept about the wars of the pastpresent amp future its a game im glad i picked it upempire earth is a great game
any age of empires player would love it
while its wildly complicated you only have to memorize each units hit points if youre serious
otherwise you can basically get along fine
thats why i love this game you dont have to be a megaplayer to get into itif you dont know the general rules the idea is to build up the biggest and baddest town fastest so you can go obliterate the other guys town
believe me its quite fun to level up fast and then go abomb the other guys tightknit stone age town
theres a hundred things to keep you on your toes calamities upgrades prerequisites unexpected enemy rushesnot once was i ever just waiting
theres always something to do whether it be clicking upgrade buttons directing villagers to a food patch leading an attack or all three at oncethe only thing that is bad about the game is that its really really buggy
because of this its sometimes unplayable
i also think that they could have done a better job on the music because the music in age of empires clearly tops thisoh well
just download all the patchesand get bombingfirst a little background on the development of the gameempire earth is a new rts game by sierra studios which is led by rick goodman
rick goodman was the prime developer of the age of empire games hence the obvious simularities between these two games
rick left ensemble studios to create his own company in order to make a game that he wanted to play
and this game turned out to be empire earth
empire earth is a d rts game that covers the entire half million years of human history
from the paleolithic age with cavemen to a future age called the nano age with laser battle mechs
hence my title of quotan rts for the agesquotnow let me just start off my quotreviewquot by saying that im not really that big of a fan of rts games i normally like realsitic wwii wargames
however i heard about this game about  months ago iirc
the shear scope of this game pulled me in as i have a bachelors degree in history
i had played age of kings and was amused by it for about  or  months but i found the game to get a bit redundant at times due to its rather limited resource gathering
but the big draw to empire earth was its d graphics
at last the rts gaming community finally gets to get down on the ground with their troops
not only that but they get to see hundreds about  or so of nicely animated units with pretty good special effects
blood quotexplosionsquot when a unit gets hit smoke from muskets and cannons that actually drifts once fired smoke from artillery impact points and crumbling buildings and fire from damaged structures and unitsnow another point about some of the negative reviews on this board
some complain that the graphics just arent as smooth or sharp as they are in age of empires
well they cant be really
if they were as highly detailed as they are in those games empire earth would require a mb video card
the amount of vram that it would take to display graphics as sharp as age would be tremendous
could the graphics in ee better of course but it would make the minimum system specs jump up at least to a  mhz machine with a mb cardbut the graphics are just one highlight to the game
the ability to customize your civilization down to a certain unit type is awe inspiring
you can also upgrade up to like  or  different aspects in each unit from hitpoints attack rating range speed  blast effect and various types of armor
if you dont use one unit then you dont have to upgrade it
which isnt entirely different than aoe but with the civ builder each generic type of unit such as quotranged infantryquot which covers a whole lot of units can get certain bonuses without the micromanagingalright now that i got that mushy stuff out of the way heres a breakdown of the  epochs yes 
 in as such as one of the  epochs the th century one has been broken down into  epochs wwi wwii and modern
the other  epochs include the paleolithic or prehistory stone age copper age bronze age dark ages medieval age rennaissance age imperial age industrial age th centurywwi wwii modern digital age st century and nano age
so be prepared to go from clubs and slings to nukes
and beyond
should be fun
all coming to a desktop near you in the week of nov thoh i almost forgot
why only  stars
because were still using hitpoints
but then again with as much unit stat micromanagement you can probably adjust each unit to about their historical toughness
also one reviewer mentioned that their short swordmen were cut down by javelin throwers without doing hardly any damage to them
well thats the rockpaperscissors relationship used in the game
it forces you to use combined arms to deal with a threat which removes the ol tank rush rts tacticthis game is a great concept and plays fairly well
my main objection is that when advancing to new epochs the units look different but play essentially the same way
still good fun though
beware the minimum requirements
i have a  mhz piii and the game is very sluggish even on the lowest graphical and audio settingseven though its not really fair i tend to compare empire earth to age of empires ii in my mind because theyre so similar
also since im a huge fan of age of empires iiempire earth is a really nice game
the grapics are nice its nice to be able to select more than  units at once its great to be able to play from prehistoric times to the future and i like how modern prophets are basically bums wearing doomsday cardboard signs
its really fun
its amusing to create scenarios where you can have panzers fighting against hordes of swordsmen or rock throwers
the vast ammount of time it covers allows a lot of flexibility in creating your own scenariosmy biggest complaints that arent significant enough to actually dent my opinion of the game are the lack of age of empires ii features
maybe this is unfair because theyre different games but i miss being able to trade surplus resources in the market for resources i really need
i also dont like not being able to create trade cogs or trade cartshowever this is a fantastic game that every strategy gamer should at least trythis expansion finishes
the diablo series in a great way while adding a good deal of improvements
i never played diablo  without the expansion installed so i never missed any of the new features which include hirelings that can travel with you between acts a bigger stash  new character classes improved video resolution and more of everything areas items monsters weapons etc
for anyone who liked diablo  the expansion is definitely worthwhilegameplay more hackandslay but some interesting quests
you have to track down baal diablos brother who escaped in diablo   the story is focused on a barbarian land that is under siege by the forces of evil
overall the story is interesting and the new areas are appropriately stocked with a mix of monsters
most of the six quests have multiple parts
like the other games lod still throws hordes of monsters at you and occasionally sticks in a memorable worthy opponent
there are about  truly epic fights including the one with baal in which there is a bit of a surprise
also like the other games there are randomized monsters items shrines dungeon walls and other things that might make a replay worthwhile but the  quests are always the same
lod still maintains the annoying gamesave system that was featured in diablo  which is a real shamevisuals the game looks good in x resolution
you can see more of the screen and the details are well done
there is nothing groundbreaking here but the visuals have held up well after four yearssound same as diablo   the monsters have more convincing sounds and speech than the npcs
overall the music is decent but does not measure up to the roaring drum beats of the original diablooverall this is a good buy if you liked the other diablo games or simply want an arcadeaction game with some roleplaying elements
the skill system does help you get into the characters more
also those who want to play this game online should especially get some replay value out of iti love diablo ii
i really do
but you know i get bored with the actual activity of playing because it involves a great deal of clicking a mouse pointer on a little animated sprite
but the music scenery special effects ambience and the character development parts of the game are totally cool  and thats what this expansion does
it gives you more character types to play with moredifferent items  and so on
it puts spice and variety back into the game just when you thought youd put it back on the shelf and play dungeon siege instead
i highly recommend this expansion
its definitely worth the moneysweet sweet game
the beginning story which takes place after the conclusion of diablo ii is visually impressive and sounds great
the background music is pretty nice also
as for the game play it the same as the others
just hackin monsters up
there are some nice upgraded functions such as you can now carry a backup weapon
you click on the  key above your weapon for a weapon andor shield or  for your backup weapon or shield
they also have allowed more strorage space in your storage chest
another nice function is being able to revive any of the characters you hired to help you on your quest
there are many new weapons and other items though most of them are for the  new characters added to the game so i havent gotten to see what they can do yet
the new monsters they have added are very cool
i have only played through the first  quests so far but i havent seen the same monster yet
there are only  things i didnt like about this game so far
 was the price
it is a little steep for an expansion pack that has only  added chapter and  was how easy it has been so far
i have beaten the first  quests in less than  hours and until the end of the last quest i wasnt in any real danger of dying this was with a level  barbarian
other than those  things this game has been alot of fun
and dont worry about everyone saying there is no story or the music is repetitious in every diablo game released
they keep buying and so should you because it is just fun
enjoythe game is more action oriented and thats good but lod also has very good rpg elements that will attract many rpg fans
the rpg focuses more on skills and perks than it does your usual strenght dex ect like other games
the druid to me is a very fun character to play and more interesting than the necromancer or the other magic users
shapeshiftsummon is a good combo be what follows you
the warewolf is a bit weak at the start however
i have only briefly tried the assasin and cannot review her in the game
elemental magic sometimes does not work and should only be used if you like to gamble with yourcharacters life
i got waisted manyatime by the quotarmy of the deadquot in the graveyard because i couldnt target an enemy with that darned fire elemental
the vines are excellent for that workd lod is a game where u can meet lots of people
me myself have been playing it for over  years and i have an useast ladder acnt worth 
this game is all about trading killing monster and dueling which is fun for mei think this game is a great succes by blizzard along with starcraft warcraft and the soon coming world of warcraftomg wootdiablo ii expansion is simply and expansion pack to its predecessor diablo ii
really the only difference is you are allotted more space for your items and  new characters are introduced
a druid and an assasin and everyone will be using this instead of the regular d
i enjoy playing this game very much
its not a game you beat
it never ends
thats something i really like about it
i am pretty good at the game
thats another reason i like it
im not giving it a  because ive played a better mmorpg
city of heroes
you want a good game
buy that
but this as wellok yes diablo is fun for awhile then it gets boringi mean after level  it is hard to advance your character unless you spend a lot of time and some reptitives meph runs and cow runsyou have to find your elite green item for your character
but when you reach level  what to you do start over give me a break after   years starting a new character and find the complete set of tal rasha or aldur watchtower or trangouls avatar again how boring plus d and lod are not real rpga real rpg is something like pool of radiance where you choose where to put your points roll your hp and deceide what spells to choose over all the givin spell list not choose from a sample list of spells like d those who have played real rpg games know what i am talking aboutbut untill they realease a good real rpg game the best games in that line are diablo and lod warcraft  dungeon siege baldurs gate icewind dalepool of radiance not that good but ok i give it a  star final fantasy  and  and that is pretty much what rpg world as to offer at is best
i might have forgot a game or  in the list hellfire like ghost rider said long lives the spirit of veangeancelord of destruction blizzards official and muchtouted expansion to diablo ii is certainly a mixed bag
while it provides many new features and an entire new act in which you the hero of the land take on the prime evil baal to get the most out of your money you had better be willing to play through the game a second time or more
purchasing lord of destruction merely to give the new act a runthrough is worth considering since the new adventure is quite enjoyable but your experience will be so brief you will almost surely wonder whether or not you actually got your moneys worthaside from the storyfinishing new quest you will get two new playable character classes
the assassin is a powerful character good for newbies with a knack for katars and deadly traps and the druid is a hulking man of nature who can transform at will into werebears and other ferocious creatures
both of these classes are excellent additions and easily surpass some of the original games selections
each new character comes complete with brand new character specific items that can be found in both the original game and its fifth act
likewise character classes from the original game can find items tailor made for them in their quest to rid the world of baal
also noteworthy is the new resolution which greatly enhances the look of the game  but should have been available in the original diablo ii releaseas far as the fifth and final act of diablo ii is concerned its easily the best one yet created for the game
the levels both exterior and interior are much more realistically designed and are packed with details that add to the ambience
the new snowscape homeland of the barbarian is the setting for lord of destruction and its different enough from the previous realms to keep things fresh
the new enemies are likewise inspiring  though youll lament the inclusion of the games teleporting imps which spell lots and lots of frustrating busy work for melee fighters
unfortunately despite the new acts many virtues its too bloody short
in fact this act feels considerably shorter than the first three and only slightly longer than the fourth
its a shame since the six quests you do undertake will be some of the best youve yet experienced in the gamein the end if you have aspirations of going through the games five acts from start to finish with a brand new character lord of destruction is for you
it feels like youre paying a little too much if you tackle it any other way
even so the snowy adventures that await your avatar here are some of the best and most visceral you have yet experienced
truly a mixed bagfinal score bdiablo  was fun and addicting
however with duping the ability to duplicate any item ingame everything got just way too easy
you could beat diablo without much of a thought as everybody had the most powerful of weaponsdiablo ii was much more challenging as that bug has been resolved
the graphics were improved and the ability to learn only a certain number of skills added a real strategic portion to the gamethe only bad thing that blizzard should have resolved is what is known as a baal run
baal is a new character in the expansion
he throws four groups of minions at you to defeat and you end up getting a lot of experience
if you dont kill baal you can do this over and over and over again racking up a lot of experience points
unfortunately this makes leveling up and advancing waaaay to easy and took the challenge out of the game
now the only challenging thing is getting to baal
so if you are playing online on battlenet you are playing against characters who did baal runs for a couple of hours and are now more buff than imaginable
blizzard should have fixed this a long time agoafter playing for several years i think im going to graduate to world of warcraft also by blizzard which ive noticed is quite similar in many ways
but im sure i will return to the world of diablo quite often as there are still a few challenges left to conquerin d lod you are following the path of baal the lord of destruction
he has ventured into the barbarian highlands to find the worldstone the source of the soulstones
the town you play in is harrogath npcs include malah the healer larzuk the armorer nilathak the elderhes also a necromancer youll see how in the fifth quest cain who accompanies you through all the acts and anya the elder austs daughter
two new characters are available the assassin and the druid
assassin skills feature lightning fire and blade traps shadow disciplines and martial arts
an all new set of weapons was created claws of which she can hold one in each hand
this includes katars blade talons cestus and scissors suwayyah
the druid features elemental skills like hurricane and armageddon he can summon spirits like wolves and vines and he can shape shift into a werewolf or werebear
he has a unique helm set of sky spirits antlers and wolf heads
of course there are six new quests and various monsters such as minotaur demons sucubbi and enslaved
new little things include jewels runes expanded stash and classspecific items
this is the game that completes the trilogyif you thought you finally had diablo  mastered think again
blizzard has released the expansion and this totally makes diablo  sooo much harder
nightmare and hell modes are incrediably harder
so many more items with all new stats you wount be able to keep up
new characters are ok but not well balanced skill wise
druid stick with wolf
summon bear and elemental abilities arent to good
assassin  has some ok skills but the good ones arent the ones you get at level  so becareful where you put your skill pointshave funwhat a awe inspiring graphical video game
with a very well thought out storyline
a must have for all roleplaying gamersi had to learn the hard way that the two best character classes are amazon archer with lots of points on mutlti and guided and sorcoress with lots of points on frozen orb warmth and wall of fire
the amazon is by far the most powerful of all
she shoots arrows like a machinegun and can change her attacks to cold and fire arrows by only expending a few skill points
the zon is best if equiped with a manalife stealing bow putting a perfect skull in your bow is bestto enjoy the game more i simply would not go to the hell difficulty at all
it is insanely difficult for even the most experienced players
there are monsters which are immune to every form of attack physical cold fire lightning poison so you cannot get very far with say a barbarian with no elemental attacks or a sorc who specializes in only one schoolon the multi player games watch out for pks player killers
there are way too many of them and they can easily kill just about anyoneah chapter v of the diablo ii world is finally played out with the expansion pack
two new characters are added items are changed and storeage space is increased  but youll need that once you win and start up nightmare or hell level
we can play it between our computers at home with with friends online but when we do the graphics get a little jumpy
the previous problems with assistants getting stuck in a pacing pattern continuefireteam bravo was a ok game
the single player mode is quite bland
but is was also challenging
the missions are basically nothing special and not very creative
not that this is a bad game i mean the controls were very easyfor me to learn and handle
it was not too difficult
the bad thing is though i dont have a wireless connection to play online so i dont know what it is likethis is truly a good game for the psp
i was amazed at how well i was able to control this game
i could command my teammate almost as easily as i could control myself
zooming in and out was easy
aiming was easy
weapon selection was easy
but here is the problem
the game is easy
the single player game hardley ramps up with any difficulty
even when you drastically change the dificulty level
the graphics could possibly even be called poor
finally there is no major creativity here
over and over again you do a very similar thing
go in and take out the bad guys or go in and save a good guy
though this is fun creativity is appreciated
all of that said
this game does have online multiplayer in a big way and yes it does support voice chat and microphone headset use
incredible that a psp game can do thisbottom line  great game with minor drawbacksthe socom series came around a few years ago and was a fairly silent launch title
after being played by thousands of people all over the world it became pretty popular
a little while later socom  was released and attracted socom veterans as well as new players
socom  was just recently released late this year and it brought back former players and yet more new players
however many people have been dissapointed in socom  so a lot went back to socom should they havesocom fireteam bravo came out shortly after socom  for the playstation  and to me in many ways it is betterthe good nice graphics nice level design decent selection of guns unbelievable online play solid single player connects to ps for socom  and fireteam bravo unlockables can hear other players without mic while playing onlinethe bad few glitches repetetive missions at time not nearly as many guns as socom  or  need another mic to talk online take a lot of bullets to kill someone lock on feature can make newbies kings hard to throw grenades unless youre used to its strange stylesocom fireteam bravo delivers a lot more than i anticipated
 great missions pretty solid graphics awesome online play
 usually  thousand people are on all day every day
graphics 
many think that the graphics are bland for this game
they are certainly not as good as other psp titles but they still are fantastic
the characters dont show much style and texture but the enviroments sure are greatsound 
similar to socom  and  in many ways as far as the sound goes
the guns sound great the foot steps grenades voices all great
the only downfall is that there is no music during games online
i was suprised at how much this actually brought down my way of getting into the game
but not so muchcontrol 
the controls at first  for me  were almost impossible to control
i couldnt do anything or kill anybody but for having one analog stick zipper makes this game rock
you use the analog nub to move hold l to strafe r to lock on x to shoot hold triangle to switch from gun to grenades tap it to stand crouch or prone and so on
its actually pretty easy even if it will take you about a half hour to get used to them good enough to take the game online and whoop arsefun 
single player is certainly a blast even if it doesnt last long and it is kind of easy but if you want the full experience of fireteam bravo you must play online
great level design very little lag for the most part awesome fun and the replay value is the best among any psp title in my opinion
fireteam bravo offers much more than any other socom game in my opinion so you must buy this game
 this game is rated m for violence but it really should be t i had just got this game a couple of hours ago and ill tell you im pretty frustrated with the controls for now online ill tell you plays in a mix of socom  and socom ii
the single player is weird though
you get one guy to help you
basically your bizatch
the controls are alot to work with since no button on this game is untouch
i think they did a great job with the controls with the lack of one analog stick
if any of you are complaining about lock on well id say its no problem
in order to lock on to you targets you have to be pretty close to your enemies
the controls are pretty awkward youll be pressing freelook
freelook lets you move your crosshairs around to aim at targets and if you hold l while in freelook
you move forward but it gets annoying and aches your hands when you do so
at this point i dont know which one is more comftable to me and i dont know which one i should be using more often
since im already use to the buttons freelook would be most helpful when your walking in a big wide open field because the crosshair is aimed up and you wont be seeing the things that are knee high they could have fixed the camera angles a big cuz when you switch from freelook to normal the crosshair moves back to its default position which is upwards
sniping is pretty good in this game
you can lock on with it and use it like a automatic but the accuracy will be pretty bad so what you will want to do is lock on then go to scope mode to snipe him
the levels are a little smaller than from socom  id say about 
but id say for  its pretty good
the graphics are pretty average they look like a watered down socom  but to me it doesnt really bother me at all
funny thing is that the accuracy is heavly affected when your running now i was shooting someone while running online and most of my bullets flew off
one thing that i really liked online was that there is voice communication
the game requires a sepereate headset that sony provides for  bucks and you plug it into the headphone jack
the thing about this is that even if you  dont have a headset
and another guy does and if he is talking to you his voice projects right out of the speakers of your psp
isnt that cool
when you register a name if your name is the same like you used for socom  and you are registered your friends list is shown with all the people that you added and will show if they are on or not matter of fact that could also see you if your online
if you are using the same name that your are registered for socom  and fireteam bravo the friends list will show up for who you added for socom  and you could see if they are online
the people on socom  can even message you while your on fireteam bravoid say for  its very much worth it
if you guys are getting it for the unlockables id say its not really worth it if your not gonna be getting it for the extras
but the game  itself is really a great game even with everyone saying o its a handheld game your better off playing your ps
id advice anyone who likes socom and like it as a handheld to get this game
you will definetely be amazed on how nice it is
most of you will be saying on how its just like socom for the psthis game is painfully good
the graphics arent consolequality mind you but my god what a fun game
most impressive is how they nailed the controls on the tricky psp no right thumbstick
these controls unlike battlefront  psp are smooth and come like second naturethe missions are cool and the game is userfriendly as far as the difficulty is concernedmuch much better than i could have imagined
fans of the series or of ghost recon will love thisok im going to explain the pros the cons and the overall ratings of the game so read carefullysound the sound is pretty good but its even beter with headphones on and the volume turned all the way up
graphics good job on graphics here for such a small handheld
singleplayer if your looking for a good single player then this game is not for you
like someone else stated in the reviews its not a creative story mode at all
its very short as well
controls the controls are a bit weird at first but you get use to them fast
they did a good job on getting past the problem of no analog stick on the rightmutliplayer the best for last the thing that makes it stick out from all other games
you can tell they went all out in online multiplayer and ill explain how
you can create and manage a clan and choose from several of different game types
you can also buy a headset to hook up and talk in the game
its very fun
the only problem is i dislike a lot of the levels design
i mean there pretty creative and all but  when there are large open spaces and you get shot from behind theres no chance to turn around and shoot back you will be dead before you know it
i have found that i like one level to my likings and im sure alot of people feel the same thing
theres always tons of people on so finding games is never a problem
you can do pretty much any multiplayer thing like clans friends list as you can on xbox live and stuff
overall  great game but only buy if you have multiplayer accesssocom fireteam bravo is an good game for the psp
not as good as socom  or  but its the only one i like
breakdowngraphics  these are very good graphics for the psp
good textures and smooth environments
some framrate problems toosound  excellent sound in this game
pretty much the same sound as socom controls  this is the lowpoint for this game
since there is less buttons on the psp it is harder to control your character
youll get use to it thoughfun  this game is really fun
the single player campaign is really easy
i beaten it in  hrs
the online is really fun too
this is a great buy to add to your psp collectionas far as physically interactive video games go america suffers from a sore lack
america also has the misfortune of having poor music games limited to the likes of parappa the rapper mtv music generator rhapsody and bustagroove shudderalthough the target audience of ddr has known of its arcade existance for some time most people are either unwilling or unable to pay for the imported console versions of the dance game
for this reason alone the release of ddr psx is a great thingfor another it offers new features to those only familiar with the arcade version
the introduction of lesson workout and nonstop modes add variety to the game such that the replay value of the home version increases a thousandfoldthe music choice however is terrible
its like konami fired all the people who knew how to choose music and hired a bunch of blowup dolls in their places
konami needs to learn to cater to a target audienceif their audience had been hardcore major fans of the series konami would have included butterfly the smiledk song that bears the unofficial title of quotddr flagship songquot
while i personally think the song is an annoying mediocre representation of j pop the general ddr gaming populace disagrees vehemently wishing that konami had included the classic
although they did include several mixes of paranoia including paranoia  and paranoia  dirty mix the game has too many softcore songs to be of major interest to those looking for a challengeif konami was trying to appeal to american gamers gamers who had never before heard of ddr or other games in konamis world renowned bemani series they should have put in american songs
we all know they have them several versions of ddr include songs like kung fu fighting amp tubthumper more easily recognized by the general american gaming populace
additionally konami included too many overly difficult amp discouraging stages for the game to be a huge hit with the average american gamer
 paranoias  trip machines afronova and dynamite rave all prove to be overly intimidating for the vaguely or completely unfamiliar gamersoverall however i think were all just happy to see this game finally in the states adored and beloved by a small cult here in the us the premiere quotbemaniquot music game is finally available in a us version
its doubtful it will find mainstream popularity here like it has in japan  konamis bungled marketing and the expense of dance controllers guarantee that  but those who get in on ddr will be richly rewardedin case you havent seen the arcade machine the game allows two players to compete in a dance competition by hitting up down right and left arrows with their feet on a floorpad controller in synch to the appearance of matching arrows scrolling up the screen which are of course in time to the musicat home you can play with just the typical handheld controller but that utterly misses the point
if youre going to try ddr spend the extra money for one or two dancepad controllers available from thirdparty companies or allegedly konami itself
wearing socks and stretching your legs beforehand are highly recommendedwhat youll discover is that its a karaokelike experience  get over your inhibitions and it can be giddy fun even for people who otherwise dislike video gamesim taking one point off because of konamis poor choice of songs for the us release
there have been three or four ddrs released in japan and the us version picks tracks from all of them  and overall the song selection is much too difficult for new gamers to pick up which given ddrs underground status in the us is pretty much everyone
youll be relegated to simple songs like quothave you never been mellowquot and quotboom boom dollarquot for a long time before you can explore the playlist without premature gameovers
worse the most popular ddr song of all  quotbutterflyquot  is nowhere to be found on the us disci like this game because there were a lot of songs on this one that were difficult but fun
if you work or volunteer at a childrens facilityboys amp girls club in my case then this is a great game for kids as long as you get  pads
dont be stupid like i was amp buy the pads at different times because the kids will think one is better than the other
thats all i have to saythis game will provide hours of entertainment as you and your friends stumble all over the place trying to do the dances
but you need to get a dance mat either hard or soft note hard mats have a  pound weight limit which many adult males do not meetkeep this in mind when picking a mat  the dance mat is what makes this game
the object is to press the directional arrow sequence in time with the beat of the song and the more you get right the higher your score will be
as you can probably imagine this becomes endlessly amusing when hopping stepping and stumbling to do so with your feet
the game can also be played two player with two mats with the two players competing for the highest score
definately a good buy and the madcatz dance mat available here on amazon as well is a good mat choice to go with the gamethis game is fun if you grew up playing older games on genesis or saturnwhich i both ownthese games are almost the same as the originals except for the sound it does not sound good at allother than the sound the game is pretty good because of the price i paid only  and their is  games so i think its greati didnt think some games should not of been on here like wrestle war and altered beastthey are not fun to play
on the other hand sonic the hedgehoggolden axevectormanand streets of rage  were true classics that were still awesome to this daythis game is  lacking titles because just the genesis games i could pick out  great games so they should of split the disc on two discs with one great genesis and one with saturn games
i would like to see sonic cdtoe jam and earlristargolden axethe revenge of the death adderarcade release onlystreets of rage die hard arcadehouse of the deadarcadevirtua  fighter saturn versionnights into dreams
even though it does not have these games its still a nice collectionpros cheap most games are still funplay like the originalseasy to findcons weak sound not enough games and some are not funits great being able to play all the great games on here but what is with the sound
now i know the genesis didnt have the best sound quality but it least it was listenable the sound on here on the genesis games is absolutely terrible
besides that gripe the games are great though being able to play phantasy star  shining force revenge of shinobi and streets of rage  without having to hook up my old genesis is great plus the addition of virtua cop  and sega swirl adds a lot to this great packageehhhhhhhh this was my first dc game
i was happy at first but ehhhhhhhhhhit has good games and stuff but the genesis ports sound like something that would be on the master system
when a  bit game sounds like an  bit game you know you have a problem
it seems like all the work went into the only two games that werent genesis games
virtua cop  was perfectly ported from the sega saturn and sega swirl is primarily a dreamcast gameanother major flaw is that if you want to change the game you have to reboot the dreamcast
it gets annoyingit says that each genesis game was test played but if it was it wouldnt sound like nes and the switching games thing is a problem that sega had since the first compilation on the genesis the sonic compilationits a good compilation but i dont reccomend itit was fun but like all of the games ive played which depict alien cultures the aliens look like humans of western european desent
if you can put the creators lack of imagination in that regard it is interesting
the puzzles were challenging a little too much so in some respects i had to use universal hint system on the net to cheat a little
the graphics are good but a little grainy at a distance
there are no real problems i see with this game that is not indicative of most games it is no myst
i still recommend it
it was fun and challengingthats the best way i can describe it just a good solid game
as for the laundry list of problems described by one reviewer i have to agree with the choppy play by play announcing
something obviously is wrong with the game itself in that area but im over it
as for the other problems he had they seem computer related
this game demands a pretty decent operating system to work up to 
im running pentium   with a geforce  and it works pretty well but some effects just dont seem perfectthe realistic graphics are a real attraction to this game
also the game play hitting and pitching  are simple  keeping the game fun
i pitched in ncaa division i and i can tell you the ball comes off the bat as real as ive ever seen in a video game
overall if your looking for a damn good baseball game for your computer go for this one
its also got quotcreate your own playersquot capability which is always a good thing
take care and enjoyright out of the box this game has a few problems
 i was playing the game and i hit the ball into the outfield when all of the sudden the outfield started to warp out and get all fuzzy
i called do and they said that it was a problem with my nvidia geforce  ultra card
they had me turn off the ap texturing and it stopped
the play by play is much better then last year more forcefull and more accurate however when the stadium announcer is talking and the play by play guys start to talk while the music starts to play what happens is it sounds like they are talking under water and then cuts out
i again called do and they told me to do some things and if that did not work try to download new sound card drivers i have a pentium   ghz system my drivers are newit did not work  its bottom of the th the game is tied and i am at the plate with bases loaded and two outs zzzzzzzzzzzziiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg the game kicks me out and straight to my desk top
another call to do and i get a hhhmmmm
the game has bugs that should have been fixed prior to release and this is very aggrivating to me
now if you can get through all of that and actually play the game you will be treated to a good game
graphics are pretty good and game play is fun
i also enjoyed some of the new features you can visit the mound if your pitcher is having trouble it rains players argue with the umps and can get suspended
when a ball is popped up you see one of the players point to the sky and game play is very rapid
so is it fun
well yes it is it is a very good game that could have been great and still may be when the problems i discussed are fixed
you can either buy this game and get angry as you have fun or you can wait until the bugs are squashedfirst things first this is a really solid baseball game
like  the pitcherbatter interface is unmatched
the graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is wonderfulso why you ask do i not give it  stars
because d is beginning to fall to the place that many game publishers and manufacturers never want to go complacentcy
satisfied with the tremendously successful  version the do team instead this time didnt change many aspects of the game
the graphics are better the sound is better but that is expected because sequels should be better due to the exponentially improving computers on the marketa glaring absence is something many fans wanted to see some sort of financial limitation on the rosters so not only do you have to manage your team and minor leagues but you will need to control the money they earn and stay within a certain limit
but alas this feature is not here so you can take the player editor and change every player on your team so they all hit  home runs and hit  all season longthere are some bugs in the game some very annoying bugs but there are ways around them and i anticipate them being squashed in a month or so when inevitibly the first patch will be releasedmake no mistake
this is a great game
but it could have been a lot betterim always alittle weiry of quotrealquot rts games because in general they never seem as fun as the quotfictionalquot rts games like red alert  or warcraft but this game is as fun as those games and in some ways funner becasue of the huge armies you can command
i hear its possible to have  units onscreen at once but i have only reached around  units which in my book is already simply amazingi have been playing the full version for a day now and only have  complaint and that is there seems to be an issue with building wood or stone walls as it seems it will drain your wood or stone resources way way too much when you have long wallsperhaps its a bug or perhaps im still not sure how to play properlyin any case that is the only downfall i could find
i would also like more sound effects but thats really a minor issue since the sounds effect themselves are good
the graphics are the best i have seen on a d rts and the animation is amazingi absolutely love deploying  ferries with  units each and unloading them at the enemy islandthey dont know what hit them but the battles can get huge and some maps seem to take forever since its based in reality and you just cant take  units and quotmop upquot the enemy like you can do in other rts games
you really need to play strategically or you will waste way to many unitsdo yourself a favor and download the demo and you will se what i mean then go out a buy this gamei know this has probably been said but i decided to say it again
no matter how good this game was on its own i couldnt play it at all without first thinking age of empire
dont get me wrong the missions are unique and challengingsometimes enormously hard
but i somehow feel like i have played the game before
the game is wonderful and this one had the decked stacked against it from the outset to badmy impressiona decent game that could have been a great gamedisciples ii is a good game
most everything about it conveys a sweeping epic feel to it
aweinspiring music and graphicsartwork abound
during combat the backgrounds change according to what type of terrain or location  if you fight on territory held by the mountain clans you will be fighting on a cold wintry field likewise if you are fighting in lands held by the demonic legions of the damned your background will be a twisted hellish place  and of course if you attack an opponents city your background will be welllike a city and attacking an enemy on the water your background will be as if on a shipthe graphics during combat are always fun to watch  these are awesome prerendered artwork animations imported into the game not pixellated blocky graphics
the music conveys a sense of both granduer and urgency  like a conan the barbariantype movie with an epic score
the music really does enhance the overall feel and experienceon the downside though ive discovered that this game does get a bit boring and repetitive after a while
playing only against the computer in singleplayer mode contributes greatly to this situation in fact every single computer game ive ever played falls prey to this conundrum
if i was to play real live humans via the internet i imagine it would vastly and exponentially increase the fun factorthis game is exactly as described in the original review but there is a very important fact which has been omitted from the descriptionthe description really should begin as followsquotdisciples dark prophecy is a game that turn based strategy fans should ownquotthe turned based aspect of the interface is one that should not have been omitted in the online reviewturn based games can be very tedious and some just dont enjoy the styleif you are a fan of turn based games then this is a game you should not missbut if you like real time then its not for youif you missed the first in the series this is a great place to jump in with no need to go back to the firstunless you feel the needthere are many who say that turn based games are deadbut this offering does a great jopb of saying quotnot soquotthe graphics are gorgeous and thats where this game really shinesalthough there have been improvements in the interface and general gameplaythe core game is still the same as the originalnot much more to add to the product reviewjust be advised this is a turn based gameto check me out just read reviews by gamespy or other reputable game sitesa  star game for lovers of the genreas of this writing this game is pretty old
however id just like to add my two cents  this is a very good turnbased strategy game
you can play either the standalone scenarios or the storybased sagas i played the latter
you can play through the sagas as any of the four races
and since the sagas are different for each race you really should play each race
also within each races saga you can play with a focus as a warrior a magician or the guild a thief
each focus will add a different twist to the way you play
plus no matter what focus you choose you can create and use five different types of heroes
only three of them warrior magician and explorer are really good for transferring from scenario to scenario
but regardless theres a huge replay value in this gamethe problems i have with this game are minor
the biggest problem is that when you transfer a hero to the next scenario you can only transfer the hero and five items
the party members youve spent all that time training dont transfer
also the spells that youve researched dont transfer either
this means that at the start of each scenario you spend a lot of time just getting your party members up to a usable stage
another problem is that you have to choose your upgrade path for your party members at a global level
it would have been really nice to have each city have its own upgrade path for the characters it generates
the last quibble that ill talk about is that the cities themselves arent of much use
capturing a city doesnt give you any inherent income or resource streams
if there are sources of that stuff outside the city and within its area of influence then you get those streams
the problem is that you can do the same thing by having a hero just plant rods at the resourcesi highly recommend this game
old as it is its still fun to playconcerning disciple  dark prophesy theres just about as sharp a division in people who like and dislike it as there was on the first disciples
and understandably so since its not for everyone
why
disciples  is a very unique fantasy roleplaying turnbased strategy game
and no its nothing like warcraft or starcraft which are realtime strategy games where you amass hordes of armies and attack in mass
sidenote if thats the gaming experience youre looking for turn to the latest and best in that genre  warcraft iii
so whats disciples  all aboutthe name of the company who made this game is called strategy first and by looking at this game one can see that their company name is also their motto
this game takes thought preparation and there are many different options to win
basically youre given an objective or quest to complete  how you do that is up to you
first you select a monarch  either a warrior mage or guildmaster each of which gives your empire certain bonuses
next who will you hire as your first general
for example if you are the human empire  of  races then you can choose the knight ranger archmage archangel or thief
they cost different amounts with each having their own strengths and weaknesses
now you must select what other    individual units will serve under that leaders command from out of  other different units types  again with varying strengths and weaknesses and at different costs
note an army of    units must be lead by a general
now what
well your groups formation is key to winning battles
once thats setup will you upgrade your capital with various buildings to enhance your armies once they reach a certain level of experience
or will you research spells
and once your generals themselves upgrade a level what extra empowerment will you give them out of several different options
etc etcthen the battles
its important who you attack and not every unit can attack every other unit
some can only fight adjacent units others can fight any and others can attack all at once
note that the characters dont walk around during battle but rather face off one in a static picture on a seperate screen
once they choose their attack they become animated but thats the extent of it
the graphics are excellent as is the artwork though id have to say i prefered disciple s artworkthink of the game like this  a chessboard
each unit has a certain value set upon it and each has their own abilities
the difference is you get to setup the chessboard with whoever you want
buying all queens would be too expensive while buying all pawns will give you numbers but no backbone
as in chess the pieces have to work together but in this game your units gain experience becoming stronger and stronger through battling or potions and spells they come acrossone thing ill also mention is the limitations on the army size
yes i also found it annoying at first that i had a minimum of four units including the general and a maximum of six after a lot of fighting
however i soon came to realize this was all part of the strategy element
finesse and tactics play a larger role here than might makes right
in fact the company thought about bumping up the min and max units to  and  in the upcoming sequel but they found that it took away to much from the strategy element
sidenote if you are interested in very detailed battle tactics  meaning taking control of every single movement and action of every single unit in every single battle  then check out age of wonders  though its not the best game in and of itselfi like not having to run around managing multiple things at once but instead i can sit back and think hmmm
now what are my options here and whats going to be the best way to win this
its strategy first as the company name implies
and if you like that sort of thing then this will be the game for you otherwise if youre looking for nonstop action go somewhere elsenote that there are  empires the human empire the mountain clans the undead hordes and the legions of the damned
i only mention this in the event that some people andor parents may have reservations about fighting with creatures like zombies or demons from the latter two empires
otherwise turn on your brain toss in some imagination and enjoyone final note this game is almost identical to disciples  yes the graphics are far far superior and there are some additional choices and units to level up as you gain experience along with some rules which have been modified but nothing drastic
so why did i only give it a 
had i not played disciples  i would have given it a  because i love this type of game
however after finding out it was merely disciples  with better graphics i found myself less enthusiatic and i never completed the whole thing though i was still glad to have made the purchasei will begin by saying what should be perfectly obvious to anyone whos played this game or any other game by sid meier
the man is brilliant
and so we have alpha centauri which essentially tells the story of what happened to the colony on the aforementioned planet that you send your spaceship to at the conclusion of civilization iimany previous posters here have mentioned that its a long game and so i will reiterate and say its a very very long game
unless youre sitting in a lazyboy or have magnificently huge glutial muscles for cushioning this game will require a whole heap of your time
this is not a bad thing though and more games should take a cue from thatthe experience should lastthe controls and basic setup are upgraded civ which more than one poster has said
in fact if i didnt know better id say i was playing civexcept for one gripe
the tech tree is astoundingly steep
my brother whos a biologist physicist and general science junkie rolled into one has played along side of me and he can barely understand the concepts that some science advances bring you
before im lambasted for this let me defend myself by saying that in civ when you researched and discovered the wheel or writing you knew what it was and basically what advances it could give you
but how the heck am i supposed to know what some of these are without a phdstill thats just one gripe and the gameplay itself is very balanced between the  factions you can play as and the ai does do a decent job of portraying the other factions as thier behavior mos suggest
the game is very addictive but i found myself able to pull away from it at night which i was and still am not able to do with its predecessor civbottom line i still play it on occasion and while its a great game its a sid meier at its heart which makes it fantastic all by itself
 it still wont replace civ for me
my moneys on civ  this isnt the first or latest or even the best real time strategy game ever made but its perhaps the best first game for those new to the genre
in rts you build up both an army and the industrial base with which to create the army
there is some valuable resource here the famed quottiberiumquot which fuels your war mchine and that of your opponent
the inherent unrealism of rts  you build the base and the army not only in real time but in a rather short amount of it  is more than compensated by the tenacity and resourcefulness of your enemy the obstacles you face and the myriad strategies you must quickly use to overcome both
quotred alertquot is actually a prequel to quotcommand and concquerquot which pit the noble  if militaristic  global defense initiative against the insidious cultish brotherhood of nod

you get to play each side and must deal with each ones respective weakenesses  the allies are better represented on sea where their cruisers and gunboats annhilate russian subs  russian migs however dominate the sky
anybody whose rts experience goes no further than quotdune iiquot  best be warned  this is more than about tankrushing
simply cranking out a dozen or so of your heaviest and most fearsome mechanized armored assets and sending them headlong at your enemys weakest point is not the single strategy
as an exmple  one mission may have you decimate the gdi base on the other side of the river
however there are no bridges at least none that last very long
so youve got to build marine transports to carry your army across  but that requires a subpen
to protect your subpen which is built on the water and the transports when theyre built youll need to crank out subs which are inferior to the enemys surface fleet but remain the only real option
also your transports can only load and offload their cargoes on sandy stretches of shoreline  and the only nonrocky coastline just happens to be occupied by the enemy
the allies may also have spies  who can walk past tanls and soldiers without being spotted only your canine units know when theyre around and the feared quottanyaquot a sexy quotrambettequot who can pick off scores of infantry like pigeons and responds with the appropriate quotkaching
quot with every kill
red alert is incredibly challenging not infrequently frustrating and quite addictive
an extensive internet community exists for those with questions or those hungering for new missions
i ran the game on my pmmx with no problems
those with more powerful systems may want to consider quotred  alertquot but theyd be missing an excellent intro to the genredk offers up a twisted slant on strategy gaming
while you do have to build different quotroomsquot for different purposes along the lines of a starcraft or warcraft you do not construct your own unitsinstead you gather forces by attracting creatures to your realm which necessitates careful construction of your dungeon
later in the game you have the capability of converting enemies to your cause
thats when the real fun begins
when you defeat enemy creatures you have the option of killing them outright imprisoning them where they will starve to death and become skeletons in your army unless you heal them and feed them or torturing them
in the torture chamber enemy creatures are tied down chained up beaten and subjected to electric shocks they submit and join your cause cough up critical information in terms of undiscovered enemy locations or hold out until they die
when you have a break in the relentless activity of attacking and defending you can watch them writhe in pain and listen to them scream
i know this sounds sadistic but its just a game folks and it is quite fun
i should also add that there are many elements of comedy thrown in from the silly little animated vignettes between campaigns to your ethereal narrators wry comments to the employment of casinos for the leisure of your minionsthe early campaigns are pretty simple so no one should have any problem getting a feel for the game interface and learning the ropes
as you proceed the campaigns get more difficult as the armies of your enemies become ever larger and more powerful at the same time your fun increases because more and more elements are added to the game such as a myriad of devilish traps you can set additional spells you can use such as lightning strikes and earth tremors and more interesting rooms you can build
sometimes you have to operate under a time constraint but usually you are able to leisurely build up your dungeon and amass a horde of creatures before attacking your enemiesi should mention that the game does seem a little buggy at times at least on my pc
at times the game crashes when i complete a dungeon mission and the game may or may not recognize the fact that i actually completed the mission after i reboot and restart and the animated cutscenes between missions also have a tendency to crash the program
all in all though the game is quite enjoyable and its still somewhat unique in its elements of gameplay and strategy
i think it holds up rather well even now in terms of graphics although it is certainly not an artistic masterpiece
you do need strategy to excel especially in the later levels but the dark comedy it offers allows you to enjoy your game even when you are not victorious
i bought this game as soon as it was released and i still enjoy playing itevery pc gamer knows of the sims and its quest to build a neighborhood fulfill a happy life or ruin it in dungeon keeper  your quest is to build an underground dungeon dig for gold for funds and thwart treasure hunters and heroes who come to slay you
you start out with a dungeon heart which is the main area if the heroes get to the heart they can destroy it collapsing your dungeon
you begin with  imps who do your dirty work mine for gold reinforce walls build sturdy floors and carry things like gold and heroes
once you have a nice size room you can make a room theme such as lairs where monsters sleep hatcheries monsters eat eggs training areas where monsters train for battle libraries where wizards go to learn spells and treasuries holds gold
there are also guard posts casinos arenas graveyards dungeons and portals
with portals that is where the monsters enter to join your dungeon
this game has a countless number of monsters not scary monsters more like funny ones trolls goblins giants wizards bees skeletons vampires salamanders angels rouges and each with a specific use
wizards study a number of spells which you can use anything from healing creating an imp to lightning striking an enemy and possessing a monster so you can see what they can see and you can control them when fighting
there are two main ways to play  ways including multiplayer single player where you go through a series of dungeons levels which have different plots to them such as slay a single knight kill a colony of dwarves invade a castle prevent an evil wizard from escaping and torture information out of someone
then there is the my pet dungeon mode where like the sims you build your dungeon to your hearts content and you control the heroes and elements which having control of the elements gets boring
the graphics are dazzling and there are cinematic cut scenes between the levels when it gives you a briefing
the big downfall is that your computer needs some real processing power for this game because of the details when your monsters are fighting the heroesin the very unlikely event that you are considering purchasing this game here are some descriptions and thoughts this is a relatively old game  thats why its cheap
it is a highly original game with a good sense for black humor
it goes as follows a real time strategytactics game where you rule a dungeon and build rooms produce units train them and fight the good guys yes you are the bad guy
the game follows a series of missions but can be played in a single scenario mode as well as varios training missions
i guess you can describe it as an underworld version of warcraft but this game definetely has its own identity
the original ideas are as followsa you have significant control over the landscape as you are the one digging through the rocks
that means that you define if you want wide open spaces if you have a large army or long narrow corridors that are heavily trapped if you are the small guy
results in the game having an entirely different dimention than most of the real time strategiesb
the game allows you to take posession of one of your creatures assume a first person look and play for a while in a first persion shooter perspective
you do that in order to accomplish a specific taskc
the ability to convert units train uints etcoverall a really great game
its age shows here and there but otherwise truly great
i am looking forward to any sequelstechnical support wise its a bit capricious in terms of video and audio cards  because the game is old your computer probably has the requirement but never hurts to check before you buy
you may also have to make special adjustments i had to disable hardware acceleration on the audio
if you have nt based windows you probably already know the drill by nowdungeon keeper  is one of the most innovative games ive had the pleasure of experiencing
it combines an intuitive interface with excellent graphics and ai and a unique setting
the interface is definitely the most interesting of these as it is a combination of real time strategy and first person action
there arent many games that attempt this and those that do were almost uniformly horrible
its great to see a game that finally got it rightas for setting dk  is pretty unique
its reminiscent of a black only black amp white but keep in mind that this game is quite a bit older
also the emphasis isnt really on advancing your creatures although there is that but on building your dungeon and wiping out your enemy
you can do godlike things such as picking up creatures and dropping them elsewhere or casting devastating spells to wreak havoc in the ranks of good
its quite amusing to see many of our favorite dampdtype heroes but this time from the other side
one doesnt really appreciate how pompous and axeheaded knights are until youre fighting them rather than playing as themabout the only complaint i have about dk  is that its old
now normally i dont complain about the age of a game
i still play red alert not  and other fabulous classics from time to time
however dk  seems to really suffer from its years more than other ones
there hasnt been an update for the game in  years and the list of possible hardware conflicts is huge
this is because much of the hardware that existed back when it came out is now obsolete and the designers didnt give much thought to the future
also dk  has some odd software quirks
in my case i have to end task everything except windows explorer to get the game running
a hint if you have trouble go to bullfrogs website not to ea games
their tech support doesnt know anything and worse all the troubleshooting links on this edition of the game will point you to themthe bottom line is despite its age dk  is definitely worth the meager cost
grab it while you cannot every video game can really offer you the thrill behind the wheel of a hot car
in fact there are very few games like need for speed that has ever been as strong on the pc
and a smash in the industry for almost a decade of the ride
i guess that is why it still is worth the wait every single time
nevertheless it just comes to be a surprise that video games arent as strong in the racing market where they can actually do a little better on the heat of the roadneed for speed iii hot pursuit is a completely amazing game that is the thrill of a lifetime
in the game you have your choice of several automobiles to choose from from classic cars like the chevy corvette all the way to devilishmade cars like the el nino and the astor martin classic cars
in the game you can run the road through  tracks including a hidden track empire city in several different styles of racing including tournament hot pursuit a wild chase trying to burn rubber from the cops through canyons and the countryside
you can also race in the difficult knockout a smaller but tougher tournament style race that will blow you awayalthough many people are more into the newer edition need for speed hot pursuit  the original is just as exciting and as tough to the bone
although many people still might want to avoid this one because it is older than the newer race games but for those who just started to buy good pc
games this is worth the wait to start the rushmy sister visited me a few weeks ago and had this on her laptop
i remembered getting it a long time ago and loved it then so i got myself a copy
it still has the same appeal and i enjoyed playing it all over again
would recommend especially with the bonus material added into the special edition version of this gamethis game is tremendously addicting and is a far cry from the original sim city
you get all sorts of extra buildings that the original did not have  school hospital prison library museum zoo and so on and so forth
the graphics are also gorgeous and with the view  set at about a  degree angle rather than directly overhead like the first simcity giving you a nice view especially because you can turn around the map to get a better view of this or that
the graphics are more varied making the buildings look more realistic like they would in an actual cityi was a bit overwhelmed at first because there are a lot of things you have to pay attention to considerably more so than the original sim city
sometimes you need to just pause the game and make sure everything is going fine  enough services for police or hospitals or the like making sure you have enough roads making sure that your water pumps and power plants are working and so on and so forth
but its a lot harder to get bored with this game than it was with the first sim city because there is just so much to do and look atone treat is the arcologies  even just one of these can increase your population by a decent amount
arcologies are fairly expensive but pay for themselves over time so if you plan your city for the eventual addition of arcologies that is a great bonus to what is already a cool game
grade  amy son like it very much sadly i bought it over a year at england and it was no much people have it this side of the ocean
with this official arrival that will changei bought this with the ambition into turning my psp into not only a gaming device but a camera on top of being a mp player picture viewer and video playbackuh eranyways the camera isnt as good as my proper sole purpose camera but for the price of   a game it was quite the dealim going to split this review into two one for the camera and one for the gamepsp cameraquality  above average  has digital editing features such as sketch and distort etc its kinda grainy at times but when the focus kicks in it actually looks pretty fair the imagine quality could be something compared to a cheap camera for a pc meaning its okay but not the best out there
it is above average though that is for suredesign  slick  not bulky or ugly at all sony did well with this onefeatures  solid  it can easily replace your average ordinary digital camera if you have a big enough memory stick ie  or gb though even gb should be more then enough space to get some decent photos and videos out ofsound video mode only good   sounds a bit to soft to me however that can easily be edited later on when transfering over to a pc laptop or ps
its good not bad or great just goodextras  surprisingly okay  it has its own menu mode like picture video and music modes with a good amount of editing and tweaking features it could have used more but i wasnt expecting some of these added options i was only expecting basic options at best these were above basic for sure
however its lacking hires options such as  x  or above the highest res is has is  x something which isnt bad but not good though its a gaming device first which i understand and a secondary device last so for what it is its goodoverall  ultimately  this bundle alone is worth it for the camera since my local gamestop walmart etc seem to be selling them solo for a high price  or higher for the camera alone and online its worth up to  for the camera
thats insane im glad i found it bundled here and with a game no less
invizamals gameplot  pokemonin real life
 thats pretty much it in a not shell it sounds stupid at first nor did i care about it when ordering it since my main ambition was to get the camera however the game isnt bad at all infact it surprised me and reminds me somewhat of the good ol pokemon days however it has elements that make it completely original on its own for example ive never played a pokemon game where there running around in your house as auraenergied freaksfor what it is it does it good point your camera at certain colors like red blue purple green yellow and so on and you get to face a new freaky thing or whatever lol its funny if anythinggameplay  basic but mildly entertaining  its basic japanese old school rpg goodness i no longer care for this type of gameplay however it was entertaining nontheless besides it offers new innovative elements like capturing creatures in im assuming over  ways that is impressive i dont care what anyone says thats alot of animationgraphics  pretty good actually
 this looks on par with some current pc games and even quite alot of wii games im actually shocked at how well the creatures textures are for a psp game i guess it must have something to do with no rendering of the backround since the backround is being rendered by reality is self
oooooooooohhsound  good music funny acting
 you can tell this games target audience is between the ages of  years old to maybe  years old
its very child friendly and unlike most games where the characters are rendered with the games engine they have actual actors in this game so far ive come across  pretty boy japanese geek dude  japanese troll gamer who lives with his mom  old british dude who acts like that one guy from the first jurassic park  indian girl and some trolls in suits i havent gotten far into the story yet but i find it to be extremely funny and will continue it if only for the horrible actingthe music is also very good to very relaxing and surreal for some reason in some tracks
theres also some epic choir music going on in here that can rival the final fantasy or world of warcraft series what the heck rightreplay value  depends really  it would depend on the person im  years old and i find this  year olds game to be somewhat amusing if only for the innovative design it has
i know for sure my cousins sisters and little bother would fall in love with this kinda game though its hip and new and would drive them crazy so if your a big brother or sister  mom or dad get this game for them with the camera if you can otherwise good luck trying to get the ridiculously priced psp cameras elsewhere at a price below  because chances are itll keep kids occupied for hours and hours because you can even interact with the animals you catch whats most awesome them virtual pets you dont have to feed or clean after
oh and you can smack around other animals tooverall   this is impressive to me i was expecting a total garbage game but now this truly was a bonus to the camera
this is proof sony can be innovative to just like with folklore for the ps and its amazing sixaxis control and flower for ps as well this doesnt rank as high as those games but boy does it rank high up therei must admit i enjoyed it the first  days
i play it constantly for  hours straight for  days
but after awhile it gets repetitive and boring real fast
i love pokemon and this game somewhat bring that feeling of enjoyment of capturing and battling pokemon
but alas this is not pokemon so there is a feeling of theres something missing from this game
but im an adult  years old so im bias
im sure kids will love it
i still recommend this game to parents who wanna buy this game for their kids or my nephewniecesi love puzzle games ive really grown addicted to them over the years thats why i have like fifteen tetris games on my wish list
dr mario may not be an improvement over past iterations but has plenty of fun to keep you entertained for a long timewhat the game is you use pills to destroy germs by lining certain sides of pills with the same colors of other pills and its highly addicting
the story is mario has had valuable medicine stolen by wario and another doctor and he pursues them
then in an rpgstyle you encounter random enemies on your journey and you must defeat themgraphics have a cartoony look and look great even today
they feel like they havent aged a bitmusic you can choose your own music or turn it off
some of the music choices are good some of them sucksounds destroying germs little yelps of joy from either mario or the opponent or groans from when someone does a move that is better than the othergameplay controls are confusing at first but generally work fine
no joystick control though its all dpad
the gameplay is insanely addicting and a lot of fun a musthave for any puzzle game fan
though i did notice sometimes matches would get difficult and your pills are randomized you dont choose them
but at least if you keep losing and restart the puzzle will always be set up differentlyoverall this would be a great addition to your n library its addicting its nutty its built like a mix of rpg and puzzle and its sure as hell fun
go play it nowthe good an rpgpuzzle mix thats nutty for its whacky story and enemies and its very addictingthe bad controls are confusing at first sometimes matches can get difficult and frustratingthis game is a tad hard for me but my wife is addicted to it
be careful because dr mario prescribes a drug that some people become addicted tothis game has a few minor flaws but in the end it is pure puzzle perfection
the gameplay is so enjoyable its almost impossible to put it down without at least one hour worth of play time
the multiplayer is a blast the only problem is that the four player mode scrunches up the screen making it difficult to see
i personally find the music quite catchy but the graphics are nothing special
also the game does not really add much to the basic dr mario formula of nes days
still this puzzle game is so addictive that it would be silly not to try itabout two months ago i was in the toy store with my two sons
my seven year old nintendo fanatic told me
quotdad lets get dr mario for mommys birthdayquot  being a reasonable and normal dad i said quotyea right your mother wants this gamequot  much to my shock after i gave my wife her present she told me he was telling me the truth
her sister had the game and she played it a ton
so when mothers day came around i picked it up for her
it is a cute game basically a tetris variant is its most basic form which is what she playsand she loved it
it is challenge and actually involves a bit of subtle stratagy which makes it more worthwhile in my eyes particularly in head to head compatition
the only problem is when i get home from work just before midnight i invariably find my wife in front of the set playing
being a good husband i sit and play with her an hour or so
she loves it and the game is fun but i need my sleep and she is constantly playing it
its worse than me with colonization
nintendo youve created a monster ok shes a really cute monsteras an owner of the last tiger woods on ps my love first began then
late nights turning to early mornings with a gang of friends who dont know how to go home at a decent hour
tiger woods pga tour is causing the same affect as the last
 friends gathering after work for a game of golf and they dont leave to go home until  or  am this game has it all as far im concern when it comes to golf for a video game
none of us has ever picked up a club before but got madd skills when it comes to tiger woods pga tour
graphics are much better and i love how this version makes you think more about what clubs to choose chips verses punches and pitches grass shots verses green shots
this is a must have for any golf head or those who wants to get a better understanding of golfonethe best golf game i ever played
graphics were good
there just wasnt anyone else for me to play against that made it a challenge
 courses and a bunch of different modes kept me busy for a while
my biggest complaint is noise
not enough
unless theres someone else in the room talking it can get errily quiet
the only other thing was i thought it was to easy to control ball flight and it didnt present much of a challenge
still worth the money though
might want to rent it firstthe gameplay is great
this game is fun to play and the controls are easy to use after a little practice
the camera angles are outstanding
but the game also lacks a lot no create your own player like kok  only three courses and only four or five cant remember real golfers
the pc version allows gamers to create their own courses
couldnt ea sports have given us the same pleasure
i hope at least when the ps supports online gaming we can at least participate in the online tournaments with the pc playersoh and the last thing this game really shows off the lack of antialiasing in the ps but the graphics are still pretty gooddarkstalkers chronicle the chaos tower for the psp a collection of all the previously released darkstalkers games mixed together to form the ultimate package for anyone who is a fan of the series
all the characters from all the games are now playable as well as all the different fighting modes
say you want to use a darkstalkers character from the third game and one from the first but with the setup from the second its now possible
the chaos tower mode is a branching path style tournament that goes up  stories
and to make sure things dont get boring the game will sometimes give you a handicap
ie no punches no kicks no blocking ect
and for going through all of that youre awarded darkstalkers character art
which is quite cool
the only real problem with the game really isnt even the games fault
the psp dpad isnt the best dpad ever made for fighing games
but you can eventually get the hang of it and its managable
and there is an easy control mode for those not into memorizing all the differnt combos for a fighting game
so needless to say if you woant a good d fighter for your psp or even a good d fighter that youre able to take with you everywhere it doesnt get any better than this
nnycw for capcom cityive been a fan of capcom d fighters since i can remember
that being said darkstalkers was probably the best title to pick for a launch game
they get to tweak the system for any future d releases could a certain fighter with the initials sf
be in the works
we can only hope plus we get to play around and get a taste of what the psp is capable of
true the controls could be a little tighter but they work just fine especially for a handheld
even better link up with a friend and take turns beating the  out of eachother with no noticeable slowdown
it makes an hour on the life cycle go by so much faster
are there better launch titles
yes
is this a must buy
only if you are a fan of d fighters or want to link up with a buddy for instant gratification
like all fighting games the replay value comes when playing against other playersi disagree with the generally negative comments from the gamespot review
i thought this was a pretty good adaptation of the frogger conceptthis game keeps the spirit of the original arcade game of several decades ago by retaining the gameplay style
froggers movements are simple and the game doesnt move at breakneck speeds
the challenge is in the maneuveringbut the update to the quotworldsquot that frogger has to get through makes the game fun and its well worth the playingfrogger is one of my favorite characters that really has not been seen much in video games for a while
i have played games that were not as good as this one
it had moments of intence excitment but some levels felt that they were unbeatable and took a long time
still this early d game is okay to buy for those who like those old challenging gameswhat can i say more than it is the board for your pc
all the fun but without the hassle of finding all the pieces of the game and setting it up
this way just pop it in and playthe legend of zelda oracle of seasons  oracle of ages both proved to make history for two reasons
one nintendo did not produce these games
they handed off it to capcom one of the most respected producers and publishers of video games
two capcom had originally produced three legend of zelda games at the same time and worked to sync them altogether as a trilogy set
however they had problems synching them so they cancelled one game and kept two in the end
what resulted was a pair of zelda games that proved to be a must own for zelda fans
not only was each game worthy of a game in its own but depending on which game you played first it had an impact on the game play and ending when you moved onto the next game
though they werent perfect the zelda game boy color games were a joy to play through back in in the legend of zelda oracle of seasons link witnessed the kidnapping of din the oracle of seasons
though you dont know why din was kidnapped you had to save him from onox the games main villain
as a result the seasons in holodrum are mixed up and wielding the rod of seasons is the only way you can change the weather and get past places that are blocked by the changes in the land the weather brought upon
for those who have played zelda games on the game boy will feel right at home
the game play is similar as are searching for items heart containers and rupees
one major new thing here was the ability to befriend animals who had abilities you can use to progress in the game
only after going through the numerous dungeons and defeating the enemies and bosses there will you reach onyx and have a chance to defeat him
once you did that you got a password to continue the story when you played the legend of zelda oracle of agesthe pros it looks and plays like a zelda game on a portable system
this time it was in color and the story was pretty good
the graphics sound effects and music are top notch
the controls are spot on and the difficulty of the enemies and puzzle solving progressively build up but not to the point that its impossible to go forward
capcom did a commendable job making the name under nintendos guidance and instead of just playing one game it was two games to play through if you wanted to see the entire story so there was incentive to buy both gamesthe cons while the graphics and sound effects are top notch youve seen them before
unfortunately they had been heavily recycled from links awakening
the layouts for holodrum and music for oracle of seasons are different than from links awakening but there are still too many similarities seen here
its not a huge knock but you couldnt ignore it from the get goin the end this was a game worth picking up and you had to tip your hat to capcom
both oracle of seasons and oracle of ages sold well despite the few flaws here
the idea of playing through two separate zelda games that connect to tell you the entire story and the game play was affected by which game you played first was new to the franchise and it worked well
it was worth buying and hopefully nintendo will consider releasing oracle of seasons and oracle of ages to the ds virtual console service in the near futureif it wasnt for the save function that the ds has for the virtual console games i would pull my hair outprobably the better of all the zelda handhelds and this is coming from a huge zelda handheld fan and after playing through links awakening and four swords adventures this is by far my favorite of the threeits a good hr game maybe  to  for the more experience zelda playercant wait to play agesthe following is in reference to the downloadable version of zelda oracle of seasons available from nintendos eshop for the ds systemthough ive yet to finish a link to the past for the gba i bought this and oracle of ages when they were on sale
now that ive finished oracle of seasons yesterday the timing for this review couldnt be betterreleased in  by nintendo in association with capcom oracle of seasons offers the classic topdown action and puzzlesolving more of the former at least that weve come to expect from the zelda series
not much in the way of a plot but the games more straightforward that way which happens to be right up my alley
youre still fighting baddies and avoiding traps while hoarding items and upgrades the most vital of which is the rod of seasons wielding the power to manipulate the environment to access new areas
spring brings flowers that you cut down to find items or use as a springboard
lakes dry up and vines grow in the summertime to help you climb up cliffs
autumn leaves fall and cover up potholes
the winter dries up trees creates snowy hills and freezes lakes and rivers
another advantage to the fluctuating climate is that you can plant special seeds in the ground now so they can grow and bear some tasty fruit lateri cant say as much for the games magic ring system
though an interesting concept on paper one can survive most of the game without ever wearing a ring
the only other drawback is that as with most nonlinear titles it can take so long to figure out the next step that youll probably stop caring by the time you reach point b from point aregardless the whole experience was enough of a challenge without working your last nerve much
and it doesnt have to end here
though you cant actually link the oracle games an added password system allows the player to unlock extras from one game in the other no matter which you complete first
the replay value this feature provides however remains to be seenthis game is rated e for everyone and features mild violencethe legend of zelda oracle of seasons  oracle of ages both proved to make history for two reasons

you had to save her because as a result the time flow in labrynna was warped beyond reality
by using the harp of ages you can go back and forth in time and get past places that are blocked by the changes in the land that time brought upon
for those who have played zelda games on the game boy will feel right at home
the game play is similar as are searching for items heart containers and rupees

it was worth buying and hopefully nintendo will consider releasing oracle of ages and oracle of seasons to the ds virtual console service in the near futurethe following refers to the downloadable version of zelda oracle of ages available on nintendo eshop for the dsds systemthe oracle series has made my summer the shortest on record
i jumped straight to ages after beating seasons in chronological order though you can play both in any order
this time around link finds himself in the land of labrynna where he must rescue the singer nayru from the sorceress veran
in terms of the look feel and gameplay this is basically zelda blue version with  key differences from zelda redto complete certain objectives you use the harp of ages to travel  years in the past and interact with different landscapes and characters
you can learn up to  tunes to travel from past to present and back again
the second key difference from seasons is while the former is more straightforward ages is more of a thinking mans game with its cryptic puzzles and infuriating minigames both of which can be mastered with enough stubborn effort and an unhealthy time investmentthe game also provides exclusive items like the switch hook which enables the player to change positions with an object or enemy and the seed shooter which fires ricocheting seeds at hardtoreach targets better suited for puzzles and minor foes than boss battles
youre also reacquainted with the magic ring system your mileage with which may varyby entering a password provided by beating either game in the series the second title picks up where the first leaves off
the plot from one title carries on to the next princess zelda makes a surprise appearance and ganon shows up as the true final boss
plus you acquire different secrets throughout your journey which you use in seasons to unlock extra content whereas in ages you just get a wooden sword and  hearts right off the batas to which of the two the player may recommend over the other that depends on hisher taste though zelda blue is definitely more challenging
but playing this and zelda red provides a richer experienceand the chance to catch all  ringsthis game is rated e for everyonenintendo have used the same link up system in zelda that they did in pokemon to boost sales
i dont know why anyone can complain though both games are excellent
you likk between the two and enter passwords to gain exclusive access in the games to finish of the game completely
both games are independant but they the concept of weapon swopping and transferingof data make this game more appealing
the games can be played in either otrder the only thing i will say is that you need to own both copies as this game is so good
as no doubt you will see when you play itthe title speaks for itself
hard but yet fun
the music score was soothing and enjoyable to go with the game
puzzles are cool
graphics were well advanced for 
like metriod it doesnt fool around for one minute
you cant mess fool around and explore like you can in mario or zelda
you gotta know what youre doing or else youre finished
i am still trying to get past the second level so i really suck
the passwords are just as hard as playing the game itself this was when passwords were a new thing in video games so make sure you jot them down correctly or get yourself an emulator
even game genie wont get you that far i know its cheating but i dont care as long as i get the satisfaction of completing the game while i get a lasting enjoyment of shooting enemies with my advanced arrowsthis game was so good that they had to mess up kid icarus reputation by creating a lame version of him on the captain n series in the early s along with lame versions of simon belmount and mega man
i gotta go and finish the second level so i strongly recomend this game for the nes or spend some wi points on it if you dont have the nes
its hard but its worth your money
same thing with the original metriodwith the release of super smash brothers brawl i was curious as to where exactly pit came from
with how many games ive played i was amazed that id never actually even heard of kid icarus
especially because it was a very successful and popular video game in the nes days where i began my gaming
it may be late but im glad i went back and played the original kid icarus
also if anyone is interested it has been released on the wiis virtual console and it should only cost you  wii points to downloadkid icarus is about pit
hes on a quest to save the world from the evil demon medusa who is plotting to kill all the mortals
just like every nes game the story is simple and straight forward
kid icarus has a lot of great gameplay elements to it as well
imagine if mario and zelda were combined to make the perfect game and thats pretty much what kid icarus is
the levels are side scrolling levels very much like mario but you can also go into doors and purchase items like in zeldathere are four worlds in kid icarus
youll go through the basic levels in mario fashion
starting with level   youll then have to explore a labyrinth to get to the worlds final boss
each labyrinth is a maze of sorts and at the end youll fight a bossthe levels themselves are fairly well designed most of them looking as though they shouldve been in metroid to begin with
youll have enemies coming at you left and right ready to take you on and all youll be able to do is blast them with arrows
there are shops scattered throughout the levels as well where youll be able to purchase upgrades and other items for pitkid icarus may be short but it is most certainly not easy
games on the original nintendo particularly in the s had a reputation for being incredibly hard
games like contra metroid and the original mega man were games you used to test just how good you were
kid icarus is much like those games
its an incredibly hard game for a number of reasons
the first being that the levels are very long
especially for an nes game
its to no consolation that there arent really any checkpoints either
another aspect that makes the game very difficult is that you cant go back and in the first three levels especially all youre doing is going up
if the screen scrolls too far up you cant fall and hope to land on a platform you already passed
youll have to accept your fate and die
this isnt all
while there are shops most of them have items that in the beginning you cant afford and youll also only be able to visit a room once
these areas however are few and far betweenthe biggest challenge with kid icarus however is actually that the levels are populated with a ton of enemies
youll be able to deal with not being able to backtrack but many of the enemies themselves appear in droves and are often hard to get by
just the same however youre encouraged to kill them to make pit strongertheres no save system present either
however there is a password system and nintendo obviously knew they made a pretty hard game as you can also access numerous cheats through the password system
but youll have to keep a pen and paper handy youll fall prey to your enemies several timesits a rewarding game to be sure its just another classic game on the nes thats unforgiving in its challenge
those who began playing video games after the nes era will be in for a rude awakeningin terms of graphics kid icarus looks marvelous for the time it was released
there are a few graphics that come from metroid and youll even spot a few familiar monsters
on the whole though its very colorful
the game also has some catchy tunes
many of which will probably get stuck in your head
theyre simple melodieskid icarus is a great game but also a very difficult one
if youre not frustrated with games too easily then kid icarus is great
itll take a long time to get through some of the games levels but at least its a very enjoyable gamekid icarus is what you get when you combine marios hops with metroids engine with zeldas rpg elements
the gameplay is fun and rather addictive and the game has decent graphics for the nes
the musical score is excellent from the bold tune on the start screen to the crazy out of whack theme of the mad reapers
however the thing that both makes kid icarus fun and completly irratating is the challenge
it is beyond brutal
level  did not even give me a chance dozens of snakes came at me before i could even lift a finger
after snakes came mad reapers which are  game overs in the form of blue pixels
they get worked up if they see you and chase you while they summon little mini reapers
soon i am riding on a typical nes game platform and nintendo actually had the nerve to place those reapers in the path
it only gets worse dungeons full of sharp blades random enemies falling from the sky a slippery block of ice that is a little too easy to fall off of
for people who enjoy challenges this should be rather fun
i enjoy it although i do not recommend it for casual gamers or kidsbefore he was convicted of sexual assault before he beat his wife half to death and before he bit evander hollyfields ear mike tyson signed a deal with nintendo to make a video game that pits a wierylooking teenager nicknamed little mac against in order of appearance glass joe von kaiser piston honda don flaminco the hippo king great tiger bald bull piston honda again soda popinski don flaminco again bald bull again mr sandman super macho man then eventually mike tyson
the bad news youre not mike tyson youre little mac
fortunately you have a chubby coach in your corner with a neversaydie attitude and a shiny pink bike who says gay people have no place in video games
so while the game isnt players and you cant fight as mike tyson its still one of the best boxing video games youll ever playcastlevania
no true gamer alive would hate this series
i mean seriously who wouldnt want to go kill dracula and play challenging platform missions
well if you dont like that then youre gay pure and simple
in this first installment we take a look at the very first game in the seriessimply titled castlevania respectivelythat was released for the nes back in the late s
how does it measure upthe goodfirst off let me say that these are some of the best graphics ive seen for the nes
very good for their time in my opinion
secondly its a fun game and you can see where the roots all go back to in the series like holy water the whip upgrades etc
practically every classic aspect about castlevania is here
the music is classic as well and has been remixed in subsequent entries especially the infamous vampire killer themeand since its an old nes cart whats that phrase again
yes this game was made back in the day when nes games were made to kick you in the  and make you love them
ive used this quote time and time again and this one of the few nes games i feel very strongly about when it comes to that phrase
very difficult and to this day i have not beaten it
the levels are insanely hard and draculas even harder once you get to him
you might think this as a bad thing but i love a game thats insanely hard so this aspect of castlevania really enthralls methe badi was put off by the lack of passwords but given this is the first title in the series im not going to rant on it for that
i feel that since this is the first title in the series i wont go overcritical on it like so many of you haveoverallthis is a definite mustown for your nes especially if you love castlevania
even with the sequels this is still one of my favorites
i think this game is overlooked because its raw andor its too hard
im noticing a pattern here after my mega man review  bah
im a big castlevania fan and i can honestly say that this game is still great after all these years
long live konami and may they bring us more adventures and vampire murderingit was an allright game fo the nes you play the role of vampire hunter simon belmont his primary weapon is the whip fighting through monsters  other spooky characters you can collect other sub weapons such as knife boomerang  more some enemies are associated with halloween like frankenstein grim reaper dracula etcthis game is awesome fun
its one of the best games on the nes
a must own if you are into retro gaminggo see the gameplay video on youtube at jbuggamer channelthe classic video game that brought a whole new nightmare to video games
you are simon belmont vampire hunter your quest is to go through five very challenging levels to finally kill dracula
armed with a whip and other weapons like daggers axes boomerangs you set out into draculas castle facing nightmarish monsters and mythical beasts like medusa frankenstien a pair of mummies and the grim reaper
this game has some fantastic graphics for nintendo and even its time
the challenge is incredible however it is rather mindless because you only have a whip and one other weapon at a time
you must use strategy and patience to defeat the five bosses or they will destroy you quite quicklythis game is very hard but very fun at the same time
in castlevania you get unlimited continues not suprisednow for the scoressound  very good sound effects for a nes consolemusic  awesome music
the music on level not stage  is my favoritegameplay  very good gameplaydifficulty  this game is a little too hard
some of the enemies can be very frustrating
like the hunchback for instanceyou cant get passwords what a shameoverall no matter how you slice it the original castlevania on the nes was a milestone for its time
great graphics music and atmosphere made this one of the more popular nes titles to get
of course it suffers in a couple of key areas particularly the difficulty
wii owners now have a chance to download this classic for  wii points and no classic controller is needed to enjoy itcastlevania revolves around the belmont clan
you play as simon belmont out to stop dracula who has been revived and is going to wreck some havoc
its the belmonts job to stop him every time he is revived and in this game youll do it as simoncastlevania is made up of six levels and theyre not really all that long
at the end of each level is a boss
getting through the levels can prove to be an arduous task however
castlevania like a lot of great nes classics is hard
very hard
along with such classics as mega man and contra castlevania ranks as one of the hardest games on the nes and its not all due to level design
your movements feel a little stiff sometimes and there are moments when things are just not fair
such as when you jump but you dont see the medusa head coming at you and so instead of landing you get knocked into a pit
you also cant control your character while he jumps
if youre jumping to the left you cant stop yourself from going left while in midair
sometimes these small quarks can be a pain but once you get used to it the game is really quite funas you progress through the levels simon has the ability to upgrade his whip
it starts off as just a normal whip but you can find an upgrade usually early on in a level to a morning star and then a third time into a bigger morning star to extend his range
there are also subweapons you can use such as knives and axes
these consume hearts which are easily replenished by smashing candles or killing enemies
for a first outing castlevania is fantasticthe castlevania series is known for having some of the greatest music in the video game industry
even back  years ago its clear that castlevania was something else in terms of its music
its gothic and dark and just all around sounds really good
this is mainly because the music of the game clearly sets the mood
you wont hear anything light here and it even gives the games already dark tone a creepy atmosphere to boot
countless tracks have been remixed in later installments
for an nes game the music is some of the best youll hear on the systemgraphically castlevania wouldve been considered a powerhouse
its extremely colorful the sprites are extremely detailed and so are your enemies
there are even things in the background that get some attention
castlevania set a bar for the nes
throughout all this the game consistently keeps its dark atmospheric look in tact
there are times when the game flickers and whatnot but this is an nes game its to be expectedthe only thing that really keeps castlevania down is its unforgiving difficulty
you get an infinite amount of continues at least but those new to castlevania will probably find themselves frustrated with it
even some people who consider themselves gaming experts will have some frustration with this game the first time through
thankfully however the game is fun and if you really are getting tortured just remember its only for six levelsthe goodgraphically impressive for the timethe music has definitely survived the test of timedark atmospheric look remains consistent and never changeseven for the first outing castlevania had quite a variety added to the gameplaythe badreally difficult gameah what a great game
who can say theyve never wanted to lay about them with a bullwhip or when that pales to do some serious buttock thrashing with a flail cw spiked ball on the endthe game is a d side scroll adventure thing in which sinusoidally floating heads of death bats mummies and all sorts of other children of the night attempt to kill you while you attempt to thrash them to death so you can go about your business in some ruined castle as one doesthe sound effects are wonderful as yet another head gets the spiked ball in the left ear or some vampire learns a lesson in keeping its distance under pain of lacerated buttocksim having difficulty keeping a straight face as i type but this was one of my absolute favorite games the third one i owned for the nesa star comes off because if you powered down the nes you went back to the start
there were no saved games in this versionquotcastlevaniaquot was one of the first games for the nes as a result you can expect somewhat stiff challenging gameplay placed in an extremely addictive formulaas simon belmont you are required to kill dracula for some reason
although it wouldnt be explained why until castlevania ii all you need to know for this game is that dracula is bad and must die
dracula knows this and so has a cast of minions at his disposal including medusa frankenstein and the mummybecause the game was made in  quite a few of the religous undertones were axed for the game
holy water is called the quotfirebombquot whereas the cross is called the boomerang
still everybody knew what these subweapons really werethe game offers detailed graphics for the time as well as absolutely amazing music and sound effects it took a lot of work on konamis part to get simon to grunt when he was hurt
the music for the first level has become a staple of the game seriesthe game however is hard
very very hard
the furthest i ever got was to the dungeon right after you beat frankenstein and igor
with no password feature this means that youll be playing the game for quiet some time before you fight draculaprovided of course you ever get that far in the gamestill a great game that deserves a place in any classic video game collectioni have not played mario party but i have played mario party  and i found it extremely boring i played this with my friends and i can say hands down the mini games are much better in this version
the one player mode in this is a snooz but the multiplayer mode is great if you have a lot of friends
i do wish though that the graphics would be improved and that the  mini games involving no skill would  be goneif youve played the other mario party games then you know how this game is played just like a board game
the duel board map is a great addition with battles and heart pieces hps and im really glad that the stupid outfits were taken out of mario party   there are also lots of new items and you can carry up to three at a time
however one problem is that the oneplayer minigame coaster or island if youve played mario party  was replaced with a retarted oneplayer quotstory modequot that takes itself way too seriously and thinks that its more of an rpg
i also dont understand why there are three save files
who needs three save files when the story mode isnt worth savingbut if you only play mario party games for their minigames youre in for a treat
there are lots of new minigames in mario party  and although some are more fun than others theyre all new and creative
here are some of my opinions on themtotally awesome new minigames quotmarios puzzle partyquot quottick tock hopquot quotthe beat goes onquot quotlocked outquot quotslap downquot quotridiculous relayquot quotmotor rooterquot quotpopgun pickoffquot quotetchandcatchquottotally retarted new minigames quoteatsa pizzaquot quotmpiqquot quotcurtain callquot quothide and sneakquot quotend of the linequot quotcoconut conkquottotally awesome old minigames that shouldve been included quotshell shockedquot quotspeed hockeyquot quotrunning of the bulbquot quotmario bandstandquot not quottoad bandstandquot quotshy guy saysquot quotmove to the musicquot quotbobsled runquot quotlook awayquot quotarcher rivalquot quotcake factoryquot quotgrab bagquottotally awful new minigames that i hope you never have to play any of the quotgame guyquot games
these games can only be won by pure luck and if you lose you lose all your coins
very annoying if you were planning on getting a star that turnmario party hopefully will be better than its predisessor which was so much fun
i have seen a un finished version at one of the computer shows but was unable to play it
the graphics seem improved on the previous two and there was an information leaflet that promised that all of the min games will be totaly new
so all in all this should be a great game for any fan of the previous two if all of thge mini games are going to be differentway too cool but its totally diffrent from  and  so look out
at leaste they got rid of those dumb costumes and lowered item prices
but it still is sweet go get itthis game only offers one thing hours on hours of fun
like the mario parties before it mario party  creates exciting new ways to play graphic visual d board games with your friends
with a variety of different maps to choose from my friends and i almost never get tired of this game
its always fun to see who can get the most stars the most coins or win the most mini games out of each of my friends
collecting stars is the main point of the game but what keeps it fun and interesting are the mini games played after each round
there are almost  mini games to play from and replaying them over and over still never seems to get old
this is a great game to play when you and your friends want to pass the time
the only down side to mario party  is that games tend to last a long time
so i advise that you only start up a game when you know you have time
other than that this game is fun and exciting
it can get a little slow waiting for other people to take their turn but the anticipations for the mini games make it all worth it
overall i would rate this game pretty high for the amount of fun it can bring to the table
the only downside is that its not a big change from the mario parties before it
so i would say that if you dont have this game still get this game because its hard to pass upfrom the swamps of naboo to the planet of corusant swsbr covers the star wars universe
lucas learning has produced the most innovative kart racer since dkr on n
all nine of the levels have plenty of eye candy like on tatooine there are sniping jawas on the cliffs dewbacks and the impressive sandstorms
also there is the option of driving all the courses backwards
i really liked the level designs instead of the usual one huge short cut per map there are several small ones and multiple routes per map
there are nine drivers to choose frombeat the galaxy circuit with anakin to unlock darth vader and each drives and handles differently
also each character has thier own taunts and special weapon like darth maul throws his lightsaber and obiwan can levitate the closest racer
there are five different modes of play
the arena mode lets eight racers compete in a free for all on one of four different arenas
the controls were very easy to get used to
you just have to learn over  different gadgets to use along the way
so what are you waiting for pick your racer and blast jar jar into oblivioni have played a demo version of this game at a computer show in the uk and i have to say that what i saw was pretty impressive
this is the th in the series and the best to date
this games sees the return to melee island when our hero entounters more puzzles and hilarious conquests
this is a must have for any fan of the previous outings as its shows with age that the monkey island series can still be new and excitingthis game kept me busy for a while
this game is set apart from the others in its new type of control system
there is a sensor in the game pak which lets you move around by tilting the game boy
you can then move around and bounce of balls collect stars and destroy enemies creating a pinball like atmosphere
this game is fun for a while but the only part of the game is the  levels and that my be easy to beat
after you beat each section of the game and collected all the red stars you then have nothing to do
otherwise this game is very good bring kirby back to gbthis game is so challenging but has good graphics i think
you will like how u have to tilt the game boy to control itits a litle hard to control kirby becase he wont stay in  spot
u have to get the right grip the right balance and the right finger movements
well thi reveiw is done
buy it on this website r go to a store if u dont want shipping and handlingkirbys newest game is probably the most innovative one in a while
you move the game boy to control kirby in pinballtype levels with all kinds of traps bonuses and fun little secrets
its fun but frustrating when a small baddie knocks you over the edge or youre playing in the car and kirby jumps which is done by flipping up the game boy right off a cliff or a mix of both
i would still recommend it for fans of puzzle gamesthis game has what you just expect from its category a lot of shooting with numerous game over screens with a load of trialanderror but thats the whole nature of arcade games pretty much
the graphics are very colorful the animation is pretty good and the controls are responsive with very good hit detection
i recommend this to any arcade fan or anyone who is curious to try out one of the neogeo masterpieces without paying an arm and a leg for the arcade home systemmetal slug x is basically a rerelease of metal slug  that originally appeared on the neo geo console system
the metal slug games play very similar to konamis classic contra series
the gameplay is somewhat linear but undeniably fun
you run around gunning down lots of enemies on a d multiplatform playing field while picking up power ups and saving captured soldiers ect
the graphics are all handdrawn and are skillfully animated each enemy has its own humorous death sequencewith plenty of color and minimal slowdown during loads of onscreen activity
the music and sound effects are a bit muffled though but one cant expect stellar sound quality from a port of an old cartridge game anyway
replaywise metal slug x provides a few interesting minigames after youve beaten it but as with all games of this type playing the player arcade mode with a friend is the only reason you will want to beat it over and over
if you are a fan of the old classics like contra and guerrilla war for the original nes you will love metal slug x i would advise those who are less acquainted with the earlier days of gaming to rent it firsthuh
whats wrong with this game
how come the characters are all so smooth  wheres the edges the corners the aliasing
hey where are the polygons
how do i control the camera
what you mean i dont control the camera
i dont need to
weird
we can understand a certain degree of confusion on the part of the modern gamer when exposed to metal slug x its a nearperfect evolution graphically speaking anyway of a genre already extinct sidescrolling shooters having fallen by the wayside years ago when some videogame illuminatus declared that the future will be owned by polygons
heavy sigh
well agetec seems unwilling to let the genre slip away quite yet
the playstation version of snks superior sequel is now available in the us and it behooves all fans of classic action gameplay to pick up a copy as soon as possible
its short its simple and its not quite the equal of the neo geo original but its still as sweet a shooter as dollars can buy nowadays
even if you dont want to make it part of your collection its one of the best rental values around
thats because despite its brilliance metal slug x is a little bit on the shortish side
the five or six levels can be blazed through in a long evening
every second is packed with action though and if you actually want to build your skills and beat the game on one credit instead of abusing the continues like a weak wimpy girlymon you could be playing through the game dozens of times
and that is the appropriate spirit in which to play a classic d shooter of which genre slug x is one of the premier specimens
the slug style is far more straightforward than something like the better contras or gunstar heroes  the emphasis is on hectic action and visual goshwow rather than complex patterns and original enemy designs  but it makes up for what some might consider a dearth of invention with a seemingly unending parade of enemies weapons and special vehicles to destroy and destroy with
if you go more than say  seconds without blowing up something really big in this game you must be doing something wrong
even if you get a little tired of the weapons selection heavy machineguns shotguns flamethrowers lasers rocket launchers a strange remotecontrolled toy and more theres always a slug to hop into be it the slugnoid slug flyer camel slug or original metal slug tank
the vehicles are all of them very cute and they provide a pleasant change from just running back and forth
the vulcan cannons mow down the bad guys like nobodys business and the sight of a hopping prehensiletreaded tank remains terribly amusing
the animation in metal slug x is better than the playstation has any right to produce
the systems ram limitations necessarily mean a loss of animation frames in comparison to the ridiculous neo geo version of the game but its still an opulent work of d art with motion and personality packed into every corner possible
your little sd commando is agile and fluid and the four different characters have all their own animations
even the hordes of faceless minions have several different expressions  they charge forward purposefully flee in terror screaming bellylaugh over fallen enemies and then jump with surprise when you pop in another credit and reappear
the backgrounds dont employ quite so much parallax scroll as some recent sidescrollers but theyre spiked with plenty of little bits of animation and theres more than enough going on in the foreground to grab your attention
even the smallest bosses fill half the screen clanking and steaming as they spew fire at you
if this is not the bestlooking handdrawn game ever which it probably isnt anyway since theres a metal slug  on the neo its very possibly the best one to hit the states given how many of the saturns best d games remained in japan
metal slugs not likely to wow you with its music tracks but the riotous effects suite plays a perfect harmony with the graphics
the sound sampling is weaker than the playstation is capable of these are likely the same sounds as the neo rom version  snk gave up on recompressing audio for its cd titles late in the systems life but the imperfections are drowned out soon enough by the boom of shotguns the chatter of heavy machineguns the scream of knifed baddies and the explosions echoing here there and everywherei remember playing tie fighter on my old  pc and having an absolute blast with it
i also remember how dissapointed i was at xwing vs tiefighter  great graphics but average gameplayand why was there no single player component
xwing alliance is the final entry in lawrence hollands xwing series of games and more than makes up for that oversightill start with the minor problems first  mission bugs
about  of the missions have minor bugs that make them almost unwinnable
for instance in one early mission you have to raid an imperial space station
even if you succeed in boarding the station it still blows up killing the rebel commandos that boarded it
i had to skip this mission im ashamed to admityou shouldnt have to use quotcheat utilitiesquot to get through a game as good as this
oddly enough when playing these missions again in the combat simulator these bugs never reappear
worse still these bugs have never been fixed even though two years have passed since this game was releasedon the other hand when the missions do work they are very effective
theres one mission where you have to save your sister from an imperial blockade
imagine coming out of hyperspace only to be faced by  imperial star destroyers and darth vaders super imperial star destroyer  its quite a shock and a thrillthe graphics are very good although not as good as freespace  although they do make good use of lens flare
youll find yourselves spending half your time gawking at the massive starships
the imperial super star destroyer is especially impressive  be careful you dont fly too close otherwise youll get shredded to piecesthe audio is also quite good
a later patch released by lucasarts makes effective use of daudio so if you have a daudio card like a creative sound blaster live youre in for a little treatin conclusion xwing alliance is a great game that couldve been a truly excellent one
some advice for anybody buying it though  download the latest patch from the lucasarts website
the patch adds a film room with which you can record your missions
it also adds daudio as well there are still bugs with some missions
i strongly reccommend downloading a mission editor from the internet if you want to do some twiddling with the aforementioned missionsdeus ex was the game that steered me away from fps and toward rpg
indeed deus ex was way ahead of its time one of those games that merge two genres almost seamlessly rpg and fps
by  standard graphic will look somewhat dated but gameplay still rocks whether you chose to run and gun or sneak and peak deus ex offers multiple paths to complete objectiveson top of the outstanding gameplay deus ex serves up tons of scifi elements mixed in with heavy doses of conspiracy theories
indeed playing deus ex can feel like immersing yourself in a noirishcyberfunkscifi novel rather than playing a gamedeus ex is not perfect which is good because personally i will have a hard time living in the real world after playing the perfect game ie
enemies ai could be better
soundwise music and voice acting is good but most of the weapons sound weak
also the main quest is somewhat linear  i wish you have a choice of which faction to side with
however there are  different endinds depend on the choice you make and trust me if you get this far youll do all  because the game intrigues you so muchafter all these times deus ex is still in a class by itself
i can only think of  other game with scifi themed fpsrpg elements that might come close to deus ex system shock  therefore if you want an alternative from the fantasy themed dungeon and dragon type rpg games  deus ex is the game to playother good scifi rpg games that i also recommend after deus ex star wars  knights of the old republic series system shock  and fallout series
if you know any other good scifi rpg games please let me knowps
although listed for windows   me deus ex runs flawlessly on xpdear gamers estimated colleagues just when i thought i wouldnt see anything better than fallout diablo and some strategies for pc  friend made me get deus ex
as i see amazon offers used discs for cheaper price even then sold out british  edition so get itwhy would you get it
it is game from  or so graphics are much better today you can play good online games like guild wars or  world of warcraft with buddies and then somebutdeus ex is a game with a story story is like fast paced ludlum and bournes identity type of novel which doesnt mean its a copydeus ex is a game unlinear you can be a butcher who does what he is told  or try to follow higher moral system of value and never take anything for granted or black and white
choices decide how others interactdeus ex is a game that can be humane why kill someone when you can just make them unconcious if you creep behind guys back and whack him with a crowbar or batondeus ex is a game that has rpg elements more you do more points you get and then you distribute them between different skills you can make yourself computer and electronic hacker or you can make flamethrowers pistols and rifles your forte if you are rambo fanwhat
i didnt hype it enough
go get it for  bucks you cant go wrong
i would even pay up to  bucks to get it although it is old and graphics is bad for todays pc best machinespsdont give up after level one you need to spend time to learn how to play but later it becomes great
ppsif i had to pick greatest game for pc since nineties i guess i would have to pick some of real time or turn strategies pirates
from  by sid meyer diablo ii fallout part one and maybe two and deus exbest pure shooters would be alice by american mcgee and clive barkers undyingsome minor spoilers and must read advices after completing gameyou have to chose between assault rifle and assault shotgun
i think shotgun is better so dont spend upgrades on rifle
later unfortunately its easier to get rifle ammowhat you really need in the game are fast legs to run away so upgrade jcs body with leg implantsdont forget to install and upgrade recovery ability its useful to turn it on with f when you fight mechs or men in blackuse rocket launcher  it opens all doors except infinite
save rockets  lockpicks bio cells and multitools and try to find nano key cartridges or codes for doors and stuff
i spent lotsa exp on hacking in the beginning then lockpicking and electronicsyou must have at least one level of heavy weapon and one level of rifleat the time it was visually stunning and massivly open ended with a weirds story line a strange game style and a funky controle system it actully managed to workthen again im just weird like thatwell for a game that uses the unreal engine the graphics are pretty disapointingthe music sound tracks are soooo coolreally cool
and the sound effects are decent
i expected more
and the physics arent perfect but the storyline voice acting and game play is great
there are five video modes available directd software rendering opengl dfx glide and s metal
well i chose opengl since my nvidia mb sdram agp geforce  mx  with latest drivers worked best and looked best with opengl mode so
fps avg on dd fps avg
there are many rts elements in deus ex and the tutorials are very helpful
i recommend this game for rtsfirst person shooter game play storyline diggerswell microsoft brings out another simulator on involving planes and now one involving trains
this sim has  trains with many miles of track
from the marinas pass in montana to the acela express in the east this game sure has featured trains from the past and from the present
my favorite is the acela express because of its unique design and the ability to go mph
there are challenges as well good activity in the gamethere are always cons to even the best of games first is the lack of a printed manual why cant microsoft afford to print manuals anymore were paying lots of money to buy these games and no manuals
except ones on the cd
also it feels like your the only human out there no people and no ai trains passing you by you are the only one out thereif microsoft would pay attention to these cons this game could have been  stars but in school terms its a bi purchased this game a couple of years ago after the initial release
for one reason or another i ended up getting rid of it
but i just had to repurchase this game
it was a little cheaper this time around considering the game has been out some time alreadymy decision to purchase this game twice should reflect how much i enjoyed this gamei personally like to play a free activity and my favorite is to take the steam engine on the northeast corridore tracks
when driving any of the trains play with full manual controls for the best effectthe steam engine has a slightly steep learning curve but its definately worth it
twisting the valves opening the firebox shovling coal all these things when done manually can lend a great sense of realism to the game
to the point where i can imagine myself sweaty and grimy sailing mph trying to keep this infernal contraption from derailing
and yes make sure you turn derailments on and switch to an external view as you realize with horror that you just cannot make that curvemy son loves trains and is an expert at them now because of this product while only being in kindergarden
but the program is so large it sometimes causes my system to crash while trying to load upi think this game is terrific but still not quotperfectquotdont get me wrong im a huge fan of trains and id loved to become a train engineer but this game lacks a bit of entertainmentwhat do i mean by quotentertainmentquot
well once your train is rolling and all signs are clear then you can comfortably go to get a sandwich and a beverage and everything will be the same
and in those quothardquot scenarios all you gotta do is to speed up and brake from time to timeapart from that nuisance the game is perfect to drive a steam locomotive like the quotflying scotsmanquot is awesome and thrillingthe tutorial is excellent and lets you catch the basics on how to run a trainive added an expansion pack of the eurochunnel and now you can be on the cabin of the tgv from britain to the continentgood choice for train fansif youre a big fan of h p lovecraft you may feel with good reason that this game uses his writing as little more than a context for standard roleplaying conventions
but it does manage to give a few chills as you wander deeper and deeper into the action
and bring to mind some of the shiverproducing moments experienced while reading lovecrafti nearly jumped out of my chair at one point when my phone rang
the game had brought me so deep into the action and the sudden unexpected noise caught me while i was expecting something to suddenly appear in the shadowy view on my computer screenthis game has good atmospheric components
ambient sounds fit the environments well
and the background music is very good  never overwhelming but never boring eitheras for danger there are very few risks involved
however when you do encounter a tricky situation youd better be prepared
and as the game progresses the chances for a bad end due to a poor decision are greaterthats to be expected
playing with dark magic and reviving the dead  i call that serious business
youd better be certain about what youre doinga couple of drawbacks as far as im concerned  there seems to be a little too much quotwander and findquot activity at some stages of the game and secondly the ingame animated videos are not always the best qualitybut they do what is needed to advance the storythis game has some of that old new england creepiness which we saw in quotthe blair witch projectquot
so if you liked that you should give this game a tryalthough this game does indeed have its flaws what game doesnt
every game has problems
the reason this game had so many problems is because dreamcatcher misjudged its audience
the target was hp
lovecraft buffs like me people that are interested in the occult also like myself and finally those who like these types of gamesheres where the first problem starts
people who play these kinds of games although they are all great thinkers they have to be that range is in fact so broad and vague that too many people wont get itthere are several big recurring complaints about this game
one its too hard
okay a fair argument this game is very hard yes
but if you are a bit educated in the occult it will not be nearly as difficult
one thing many people fail to realize about this game is that some of the secrets and puzzles in it are based on real occult information
much of it is rather simple like astrological signs signs of the days and the lik e as a hint for people playing this game look for a book called heptameron  you can probably locate an online version more than easily  or look on a website called  it has lots of occult books and authors ranging from simple to complex and theyre all free to read right off the site however when you have to perform the spirit summoning spell of eliphas levi there is a complicated ritual that you have to go through and lots of items to collect for ithowever i will vouch for the difficulty complaint be saying that there not enough hints to nudge you in the right direction
like the salts room for example
there are about  long aisles lined to the brim with shelves jugs and pots full of ashes of all different kinds
youre looking for one particular jar  there are no tips as to its location anywhere in the game  the only way to know is to already have enough knowledge of who eliphas levi is
and that again is based on real occult information littered throughout the game in very cryptic forms that the average shmuck wont understand
better yet theres one point in the game where you have to mix a special brain fluid
once again the chemical shelf is lined with all kinds of chemicals with no clues to the mixture
the only way i solved this puzzle was through trial and error  long trial and error im too stubborn to use a walkthruall that aside though this game is very good
and keep in mind lovecraft fans it isnt directly based off any of his stories
instead it takes certain elements from various stories and meshes them together very well i might add
stories such as charles dexter ward nameless city dunwich horror etc
are used
even one of the houses is designed directly after strange high house in the mist
so lovecraft fans fear not  youll get your fill
just not in the way you might imaginei highly recommend this game to anyone that doesnt mind having to do a bit of research into the occult world to fully understand whats going on
either that or look at a walkthrough
the developers definitely had their hearts in the right place with this interesting game but their minds seemed to have gone off on a bit of a tengent with the puzzlesi played this game way back in the day
its still as fun now as it was then
definitely a good buy for the moneywhen i first got my psp this was a game i bought with it
and it was worth buying it
the graphics in this game are d garhics and they are pretty good but i thought it whould have been better if they were d graphics instead
now for the gameplay when you punch your oponet you can see the exprssion on the face and there is some blood in this game to
a con have about this game is that there is no fighters to unlock
so it gets boring after a while playing it when there is no fighters to unlock
they should came up with a few more new fighters and locked them
the other con is the dpad
because of the dpad it is extremly hard to do the combo moves
overall i give this game a i like this game you already know why if youve seen my other reviews
go buy it if you like this kind of gamechances are youve already played street fighter alpha  before
and because street fighter is such a well known fighting series rather than pound into you what you probably already know lets take time to establish what this game does differently than most other fighters
it is a port but its a reworked port
not just a straight over portfirst of all there are  different characters that you can choose from
this makes street fighter alpha  max one of the most populated fighting games of all time
each character also has his or her own backstory and set of dialogue
that alone makes this game a bit more worthwhile than most other games where you basically play through the same story but with a different character
here each character has their own unique storycharacters also fight with three different isms if you will
the simple stylings of the xixms will remind you of street fighter ii while aisms give you plenty of powerful moves and visms let you use custom combosthe gameplay is about the same as your traditional d fighter
they throw in a bit more though
such as a guard gauge for players who do nothing but guard and there are also recovery moves that prevent you from taking more damage than necessaryits in the controls however where i found a bit of a problem
some moves are harder than they have to be to pull off on the psp
perhaps because instead of porting over the exact same controls theyre changed up a little
some moves require you to press multiple buttons at the same time
this sounds easy and no problem at all but mix it with the dpad and weve got some problems
for the most part its easy to adapt to and most people wont have a problem with it
but for those who were in love with street fighter alpha to begin with it takes time to adjust
to get it perfectly clear in your head that the controls arent the same
after a while this isnt much of a problem at all of coursethere are several different modes
the basic arcade mode and versus mode of course but theres also some modes that are more fun
such as the dramatic battle
this is simply a two against one battle
either youve got a computer ally or youre by yourself
the tag team mode in this game probably couldve been done a little better
it just feels like dramatic battle all over again to be honest with youtheres also a world tour mode which imposes strategy on your part
certain characters you face will have weaknesses and strengths
its pretty fun because youll gain experience and level up as you go
because of this element youll find world tour mode to be worthwhileeven better you can hook up with friends and play
thanks to the wireless support of the psp you can play against your friends really easily
however you cant go online and with a fighter as big as street fighter that wouldve been really nice to havestreet fighter is brilliant looking
its d graphics look even better on the psp
it goes to show that just because youre capable of d doesnt mean its the only beauty
these backgrounds and drawn characters look just as good as ever
theyre also really bright and colorful
so much that they draw the player in
some of it does look dated but if youre a true gamer that wont bother you too much
the sound effects and everything are fantastic too despite the fact that i couldve gone without the announcerits a great game
it always was and always will be
if you want some nostalgia pick this up
youll love it im surehowever on a closing note i cant help but admit that once again the psp has received another portrerelease
all of the psps best games right now seem to be ports and rereleases
and this is no different
its a great game
a fantastic game but is it too much to ask for an original titlethe goodclassic addictive gameplayloads of charactersthe ability to raise characters is really cool and addictiveplay with your friendsthe badsome of the controls take time to get used toono online playyou cant help but admit that its just another port
a great port but the psp needs something thats you know an original title
its a game but once again the psp is receiving a great game thats already been donei like this game alot but the combat is not all that intresting its good but you will be playing this more for the story and puzzles and just fighting when force to or when you just want to hack n slash over all it good just look at the water there is some slow downs but not that badafter beating the first soul reaver i couldnt wait for the second one to get here i was even more jazzed that it was going to be on playstation
for you soul reaver vets part  is graphically far better than the first obviouslyone of the coolest surprises about the second installment of this series is that all the abilities you obtained from the first game have returned to the second
the story line and cut scenes are pretty cool and a bit wordy but the story is what the game is all about right
this time around you are back in time before the vampires took over and killed everyone so some of the enemies you will face are actually human
the one very noticeable thing is the fighting as gotten much more difficult
its not the vampires you dont have to worry about anymore the humans are pretty challenging and if you arent careful they will beat you down
i havent beat the this game yet but i am so far not disappointed with what i have seen so far
great sequel and a great game for sr vets and first timersthe graphics at that time and storyline convoluted though it may well be set this apart from a lot of games on the market and lend it an epic and ominous feelthis is a game that could and should never be subjected to the lets make a movie out of it phenomenon because it manages to be both maddeningly nonlinear on one hand such a huge cinematic experience unto itselfthe voice acting as has been the case throughout the lok series even the disappointing blood omen  is topnotch and the game itself positively drips with atmosphere with only a few glitches and a few rather weak gameplay elements keeping this game from being very nearly perfectthe climactic showdown of the game turns into a real mindtwister which you will either love for being cruel and clever or hate for being hokey and obtusepersonally after i unkinked my brain from the implications of it i rather enjoyed iti basicely got this gamebefore legacy of kain and thought it would be good i was so wrong
when i first played i got stuck on the place where you have to get a light reaver
at least you get to steal weapons
i cant even bare to use the reaver it is so flimsey bye byeive had this game for about a year now
it took me a while to learn how to play but once i got the hang of it i couldnt put it down
ive been playing it for about sixty hours now and am probably only half way through it
i like the stages of digivilution more then the first digimon world game
you dont have to go through the in training level and you can get to the mega level
this is a long game and theres a lot of strategy in it
ive heard people ask how to get metalgreymon in the biodomain
just use the toy plane that mark shultz gives you in the tamers club
just give metalgreymon the toy plane and nothing else then he should be yours
the bad thing about this game is some digimon dont go by the traditional digivilution stages like in the television series
like gabumon who digivolves into centarumon in the game instead of garurumon
but if youre a digimon fan like i am then you will like this gamei was a little disappointed in gt
the graphics were awsome but i just could not get into it like i did the other  it just seemed too similar to mebut ter is another matter
i just loved it from the start
the racing is fast and fun
the graphics although not quite up to gt are not far off and are pretty darn goodthere is a big selection of cars which i always enjoy and alot of things you can do too them
not as much as they could have maybe
but enough to have fun withmy big problem is that i spend the money on making the car look hot and not on making it faster
the temptaion to add stickers and stuff is just too muchif you want to play something different to gt or were a little disappointed in gt like i was then give this game a lookthis game is a worthy purchaselots of rivals to race and cars to customize
graphics are descent as well as the ingame music
if you enjoyed tokyo xtreme racer  then you will enjoy this one as wellany fan of japanese cars and tuning will enjoy this game
i highly recommend it along with its successor tokyo xtreme racer this is a very cool racing game
instead of the usual pick a car track and race other cars you actually cruise the streets for opponents challenge them and if you win use the money to tune your street machine even morethere are alot of very innovative things in this game
you cruise the streets in your car and flash your headlights at other tuned up cars and challenge them to a race
this makes the game very realistic
as you cruise looking for opponents there are civilian vehicles on the road to avoid
the civilian cars are realitivly smart too if you stop in a lane and put on your hazard lights theyll change lanes to avoid you very realistic
you can upgrade your car many ways from adding ground effects to stickers to wheels and horsepower upgrades
the cars are not named like honda civic mitsubishi eclipse etc
they have numbers instead but are still recognizable to their real life counterparts
there are a ton of rival gangs to race and a variety of other modes like time attack and free runalthough the game is a great new take on racing the graphics are nothing special
when compared to gran turismo s city night scenes they look very poor
but the graphics are still above psx level and the cars are very good lookingthis is a great racing game but if i had to pick one i would go with gt
still its worth getting tokyo extreme racer zero if you are at all interested in import racingto begin with this game is unlikely to sell many copies
it is a strange mix of childrens graphics with difficult gameplay
the game is so difficult that single player mode is almost impossible and very frustrating
your fingers get tied up
 player is a far more pleasent experience although it too can be slightly jarring since you are solving puzzles while constrained for time
the control and graphics are both quite good  which are the two most important game metrics for mefinally there is really nothing else out there like this game
sure you could have doa hardcore or raymanrevolution  both of which are excellent games  but realistically purchasing this game lets publishers know that there is a market for highly original concepts
plus it is just fun to play
if you liked samba de amigo worms mtv music generator incredible crisis or any other genre bending low selling games add this to the collection
it is a keeperjust got this the other day and found it to be a fun game to play with you child
i emphasis with not against as you must cooperate with you playing buddy for either of you to move through the game
the control and graphics are great and the puzzles are easy enough to not be frustating but hard enough to present some challengeif you are reading this review youll probably love this game
it has a lot more in common with oldschool  and bit classics like bomberman ice climber wrecking crew etc
than with any modern games
if you bought ps just for madden and gt youll hate this game
cute characters wacky music weird story and wildly inventive gameplay
basically you control two characters in a race against time
you cant really die or run out of lives which is good because there are points that would be incredibly frustrating
both characters need to work in conjunction each tripping switches etc
on his side of the course to open things up for the other character
i would imagine this would be a blast two player but with just one player controlling both rabbits it gives new meaning to the word quotchallengequot
you really need to learn to watch both characters and the game demands you perfect the art of doing two things at once
once you get into the groove of it its not so bad and youll start to have fun
im really happy they are  releasing quirky games like this on the ps so early in its life
with psx we had to wait a while to get the really weird games
you can tell alot about what kind of gamer i am by the first three games i bought for ps this game fantavison and star wars super bombad racing
im way oldschool and enjoy puzzle and aracdetype games
this one was right up me alley
im guessing you are either going to love or hate this game depending on your preferences
there probably isnt really a middle groundi love this game
i had it years ago but ended up selling it and a dozen other games to pay some bills ha
but i ended up being able to buy it not too long ago and have been loving every minute of it
i love this game
my sister loves this game
my best friends love this game
sometimes we wish there were more of a mission but really that wouldnt be the point of the game right
its fun and challenging
the spacial challenges are especially fun and excitingi have played crazy taxi for  years it is one of my all time favorites cool game play great offspring sound track my only problems with this game is the cars sticking to the pavement and the cars sliding to much and i hate to upset the other reviewers but the graphics were enhanced on the ps and gamecube as well as the sound track was improved from the sega dream cast version trouble with the xbox version they keep looping the same track i like the song no brakes but be more imagineitive but the plus side is that the environments are morell open the psp version is great as well the xbox version is disappointing the graphics are weak and the sound track is also weak no xbox improvements other than achievements and avatar clothing sega defintely did not bend over backwards for this one good one sega akklaim may the studio rest in peace did a better job with crazy taxii find this game extremely fun
basically you drive around pick people up and drop them off at their destination
but its more than that
you can drive up ramps go under the ocean crash into cars and watch them do funky twists and spins if you hit them enough and basically wreck havoc in the city
the music is pretty cool along with plenty of places to go in the cities and four drives to choose from
there is one problem though there are only two cities to choose from and only four choices to choose in the cities for time arcade three minutes five minutes ten minutes  but dont let stop you from getting this fun gamefirst off the problems encountered by quotpatsfanquot are not representative of this product as a whole
he most certainly has a flawed disc andor a faulty ps unitcrazy taxi was an extremely fun arcade game and the transition here is a pretty good one
you get the classic arcade level along with the original four drivers
contrary to other reviews though you do get more
for one a second level is added to the game featuring some pretty interesting landmarks you can drive along train tracks through the city subway and over a draw bridge for one
there is also another bonus game quottaxi cubequot which sees your favorite cabbie partaking in various obstaclestylecourses
these levels are fun and do break up the monotony of the two ordinary levelsas far the the specifics of the conversion are concerned popup is not a great problem there dont seem to be any collision problems and the game trucks along at highly impressive frame rates even in the midst of the highly insane action its not called quotcrazyquot taxi for nothing
the sound is great and all of the songs from the arcade are present herethe ultimate replayability of this game may come into question after all it is only two levels long
further more it seems like a compilation release of crazy taxis  amp  perhaps on a dvd format ps disc would have been more logical for sega acclaim and sony
but crazy taxi is ultimately meant to be one thing and one thing only fun
luckily it delivers in spades
the game is quite fun and the ps conversion offers just enough extras to make this game worthwhile
plus its just plain cool to see a sega game on the playstationsure its not as good as the dreamcast version buts its still a fun game
the only real downside i saw to the game was the pop up
but its not that bad as most people make it out to be
ive been playing it all day today and ive been loving itthe concept is ridiculous but a lot of fun
the crazy box is full of mini games to help you get better at the game
the drivers stats are different so it does matter who you pick even though it doesnt show that
i would have rated it higher but the saving takes so long that  have to save after a few playthroughs
this game is why you went to an arcade to play something crazy
get it and have some fun
here we go
ya ya ya ya ya
recommendedcrazy taxi was originally a very popular arcade game and first made a console appearance on the nowdefunct sega dreamcast
in  crazy taxi arrived on the playstation  and sold enough copies to make it onto the greatest hits line
it was only a couple of months ago that i finally picked up a copy of the gamethe premise of the game is that you are a cab driver and it is your job to pick up fares and deliver them to their destination in the allotted amount of time
there are no rules only that you get to the destination as fast as possible
you can drive in whichever lane you want or the sidewalks and hit as many cars as you need to if it helps you get to where you are going
it is a fast paced game and is a lot of funthere are two game modes arcade and original
arcade mode has the san francisco level that you may have played in the arcade
original is a brand new level created just for this game
while the streets are different there is no difference in the gameplay and after a short time of playing i didnt really notice any difference between the two
on each of the two levels you have the option to play by arcade rules limited amount of time with time bonuses for delivering passengers quickly or to select a specific time limit
there is another game mode called crazy box
crazy box is essentially a training mode where you get to perfect your skills
there are initially  different challenges and some of them are quite difficult but as you complete the challenges a couple more open up and these are exceedingly more difficult
the good thing about crazy box is that it is something different from the regular game and as an added bonus i probably would not have learned some of the skillstricks in the game without crazy boxthe game is fun but it is awfully repetitive
after playing for a week or two i started quickly getting bored because there is very little variety in the gameplay and youll find that you are just bringing the same customers to the same locations and the fun begins to wear off
rather than purchasing this game it might be best to be a weekend rental with some friends
even though it is only a player game it does have the sort of party game feel to itthe four star rating is for the initial fun but it wears off too quicklyafter playing this and simpsons road rage i have to say that road rage is much better
crazy taxi is a really cool game and is lots of fun to play but it gets really old after a while
the same people the same music the same towns and you dont get anything special if you do good
in the simpsons road rage you have to earn enough money to unlock characters and different stages
it adds weeks of replay value where crazi taxi is good for a day or two
out of a perfect  heres what i give itsgraphics control sound fun factor this is a very fun game for any age
basically all you do is drive around doin taxi missions but its really fun
definately a buy for any gamerthis game is pretty cool
a must have for fans of arcade style games and fans of sega
however it was done a lot better on segas dreamcast
tends to lag on the ps as well as on the gamecube and xbox versions
sega games will always be better on sega hardware
long live sega
return to the hardware marketif youve never played a crazy taxi game go ahead and give this a try but it gets old quick
if youve played   or  then youve played them allcrazy taxi was so original when it first came out that everyone was going made over it but now i think its wearing a bit thin
i do think that bringing this game out on playstation  will give exposure to a new audience but i think that they should of held of a bit longer and just brought out number  instead
dont get me wrong i still think crazy taxi is a good game and i cant stop playing number  but i think that they are just going to be milking more money out of the playstation  owners by releasing this one
if you have the cash to spare and you want something different then this would be a good choice and it will provide you will endless amounts of fun
until number  comes outcrazy taxi is a must have for everyonekidsadultsteensi borrowed this game from a friend and i love iti plan to buy it in the futureit has lots of modes

if you never have played super mario bros  this is a must buy for youwhile i admit this isnt the best mario game it is my favorite
why
 you might ask
for one thing it gives us a break from the traditional jumpontheenemiesheadsandsucceed gameplay
while jumping on something is probably a better way to defeat things then having to have to look around for something to throw at them and im not the type who likes the idea that you have to depend on some form of item but super mario advance which is conviently  games in one pack keeps the veggies abundant and provides other ways to defeat enemies
you can pick them up and hurtle them
i will first describe the newandimproved super mario bros  then i will describe the second game which has also ben modified the mario bros arcade gamesuper mario bros  is the main part of the game
this is a noticeably better version of super mario bros  due to the giant vegetables and larger enemies that supply hearts whenever you throw them or hit them with something
though it is rare to find these giant creatures i like them
the giant vegetables take out so many more enemies at a time that i cant believe itthe game is creative in its design as each world is very rich and cartoonish though i imagine it could be more of a dream
and it turns out that the whole game is a dream that mario is having
however there are only  designs and  worlds
the designs are grass lands sort of deserts and a castle
the grass lands i prefer but i have a few favorites in the deserts
all the worlds are very rich and very beautiful especially the castle which is built on the cloudsyoud also think that theyre fairly peaceful but the number of enemies and creatures running around is insanely high
luckily you always have something to defeat them with including their allies
yes you can pick enemies up and throw them
sometimes you even have to ride on their heads to get over a platform covered with spikes
yes enemies dont get any better then thisgraphics are marvelous as far as the characters designs are and the platfomrs
the upsetting thing about the graphics is how tight the screen gets especially when youre carrying a giant vegetable or a giant enemy
also the design of the castle is astonishingly beautiful
too bad it belongs to such an evil toadeach character is differentmario   speed  power  jumpluigi   speed  power  jumppeach   speed  power  jumptoad   speed  power  jumpnow dont freak out if youre a peach fan
shes an excellent choice for almost any level because of her ability to float through the air for a short time
i used peach more then any other character
dont think that youre rare chance to play as toad is spoiled either
while his jump is noticeably weaker i wouldnt say that toads jump is really any different then marios
luigi has an annoying flutter to his jump that makes him hard to time and somewhat loose in control
luigi is still and excellent choice for most levels as long as he isnt facing a birdofinally i will discuss the enemies
shyguy is a very typical enemy
most of the time giant enemies are giant shyguys
blue shyguys are confined only to the platform that they are on
red shyguys can walk off the platform that theyre on and roam around almost anywhere
gray snifits shoot bullets out of their mouths
the blue and red rule for the shyguys applies for the gray snifits
beezos are flying enemies with forks
flurrys are iceskaters
pidgits are little birds on magic carpets
sparks circle platforms and just fly and are so annoying
phantos come to life whenever you pick up their key
they guard keys
pansers spit fire balls out of their heads
hoopsters climb on vines ropes ladders and chains
trouters are fish
porcupos are sharp cookies
albatosses carry bobombs
tweeters are great for defeating bosses s use them
cobrats are a type of snake
pokeys are layered cactuses like from super mario world
autobombs are cannons with wheels
shyguys usually drive them
ostros are also riden by shyguys
birdo is the most common boss
there are pink red and green birdos
fry guy is a flying fireball
mouser is a bombthrowing mouse with sunglasses
tryclyde is my favorite headed snake
clawgrip is a mutated crab with a passion for rock throwing
theres an unnamed creature in the game in the last level
it is a flying hawk head like the ones that eat you when you complete a level
wart is the main bad guy who hates vegetables
so why are they growing all ove subcon if hes taken overthat is my favorite super mario bros  version
sure the nes version was good but this is the bestmario bros was once an arcade game
players would jump up and bump the enemies above them and thenkick them off the screen
thats great fun but the main reason i think that nintendo put this on was to give the game a multiplayer feature
im not too keen on it but it is pretty neatspineys are turtles with spikey shells
fighter flies are hopping flies
crabs have to be bumped twice
fireballs fly all over
there are red and green fireballs
freezies freeze the platformsingle player mode is simple
you run along and bump enemies then you kick em off them screen
easymultiplayer im not going to go into
my review is long enough nowso i know this is a hard to find game
but if you want it find it used
it probably wont come with an instruction booklet or a box
i just ordered a book from the nintendo online store and i got the actual game on ebay
if you need a box im sure you can find one on nintendos online store but i just keep mine mostly in my game boy advance or my gba kit
i recommend this game if you can ignore the few problems
oh and i forgot to mention the wacky camera
its wacky but workablefor those who played the original mario  like me this will sort of be like a flash back to the past
there a little graphical improvements the sound is better but in general theres nothing really different about the game except now you can play it wherever you go
the most annoying feature is the characters voices
they just wont shut up
this can me easily ignoredwith lots of self control but it slightly takes away the fun of the game
i personally like the game mario  and i think packaging it with the original mario game is good thing or else this game wouldnt be worth it for the people who played this game before
for those who havent played this game yet youll surely not regret having it
its fun and it requires more strategy than the other mario games because its different than all the other ones
you cant kill enemies by stomping on them youll have to do more than that
im personally waiting for remakes of super mario world and super mario   those games i think are the best mario gamesits a pretty good game but i liked super mario advance  and  the best but this one was pretty cooli got this for my son he was amazed by it and had a lot of fun even though he isnt very good at it
i would recommend this onethis super mario advance is an updated version of the nes classic super mario bros  while it is still a good game this updated version is ruined in a couple of ways
 they made mario and the other characters talk which is annoying
 there are vegetables that can be picked up to throw at your enemies
they made those veggies gigantic
they take up too much of the screen
they made super mario bros  on gba a classic nes series which left the game unmodified and the same as it was on the nes system near  years ago
smb
 and smb
 should have been unmodified and classic nes series as wellyouve played it on the nes as part of super mario allstars on super nes and maybe some of you have played it when it was doki doki panic on the famicom disk system
now youll be able to play super mario bros  on the game boy advancewhat can i say
its another awesome remade smb gamethe fact that you can do multiplayer is simply awesomealsotheres the original arcade mario broswhich most people just ignorei reccomend this game  highlyhaving played smb on the nes i am appreciative of old games being brought to the gba
come on already and bring out the  zelda games for nes
and this game is no exception
having played the advanced versions of the final fantasy series i expected similar upgrades to this game and i was not disappointed
along with a save feature comes improved graphics and gameplay
i would have really liked for the original nes super mario bros to be included with this set as the arcade smb game is in this set and that same game also comes with the other mario advance games which is unnecessarily repetitive and cost this game a starlike mariolike luigiwell luigi is in this game toolike a princesslike a mushroom girlwell they are the chararcters of this gamethis is a brand new world for mariomelissai can see why some people didnt like it
the controls were a bit iffy but it was still a fun game in my opinion
then again most classic mario games arei often have been enjoying a lot of classic video games from the s that have really been resurfacing over the past few years
it really is wonderful to see older games feel fresh and newly exciting again
that truly has been the case for one lucky plumber mario
nintendo really has done a remarkable job of reintroducing mario games to the game boy advance audience
it has done very much wonders for a lot of people who are now enjoying the feeling of the most groundbreaking entertainment that has ever brought games to the home
nintendo did it originally with super mario brothers and their sequel was opposite any of the classic mario stories that had ever been toldsuper mario advance super mario brothers  is a restored version to the classic video game from the late s
the game features your option of one of four characters to control mario or luigi toad or princess toadstool
the game is located through seven dream world stages and  different levels
the gameplay focuses in on a nightmare mario has as he and his pals stop wart and his henchmen including birdo mouser fryguy and many shyguys from ruining the dream world mario is stuck in
the game doesnt feature the traditional super mario gameplay where instead you dig deep to pick up items to hurl at your opponentsyet with all the goodsides there really are a few downsides to this game
the graphics do seem a little bit out of tune unlike their original nes gameplay or even the remastered gameplay from the  super mario allstars compilation for the super nintendo
another problem is the controls
they sometimes can make it very difficult for you to hurl bombs and vegetables when need ed at your foes
sadly that does bring unfortunate problems in gameplay at timesall in all super mario advance super mario  is a great exciting twist to the original super mario brothers saga
for anybody who hasnt tried this mario game it really just is worth it for the game boy advance
it really is a surprise that just is a delightgraphics csound ccontrol bgameplay boverall bthe gameboy advance is unique in the nintendo catalogue as being a system without an original mario title
barring the abysmal failure of the virtual boy the lack of a mario title has never occurred before or since
much like a person without a country a nintendo without a mario just feels adrift and cut off from the rest of the gaming universe and real time gamer economyof course one could argue that mario is nintendo
to remedy the lack of mario instead of developing an original game instead nintendo elected to issue the super  mario advance series which are simply remakes of preexisting mario side scrollers
there were four total
although disappointing that we never got a real mario game for the gameboy advance the advance series holds its own as great portable mario fun although this strength is primaly found in the original games themselvesalthough probably not a concern now years after the fact if you have a gameboy advance and you are looking to purchase one of the mario advance titles you may be better served with one of the other longer games
if you are not familiar with super mario bros  the game is twenty levels long and can easily be beaten within an hour if you are speedrunning or even if you are taking your time
if you want longer play time then i would probably go with super mario advance  super mario worldhowever for those who love the mario series and super mario bros  in particular this is a fine remake even with all the changes from the original game
given the age of this remake unless you want to experiences the changes for yourself you may be better served picking  super mario bros  up in some other regard such as a digital form or the  super mario allstars remake for the wiibeware of one change
the voices
oh god the voices
they are horrendous
all four have been given voice acting
these sayings get grating to say the least
almost to the point where you want to play the game without audio its that bad
super mario bros  for those unfamiliar with the game is the most drastically different of the four bit mario titles
mario defeats enemies by  picking either them or vegetables up and throwing said enemyrandom vegetable at other enemies
the story is that an big green final boss named wart has taken over the world of dreams called sub con kidnapped the citizens of subcon and has taken over and styled himself as king
it is up to mario luigi toad and princess toadstool to overthrow wart and restore order
there are seven worlds total with three levels per piece and the final world having two levels for a total of twentythe enemy roster for super mario bros  were almost exclusively limited to this game in the first few years after its release with only bobombs appearing in the followup super mario bros  and ninjis appearing in one level of the snes super mario world
however in subsequent years enemies from super mario bros  have become mainstays in the mario universe and also appear in numerous spinoff titles
notably however the four bosses mouser tryclyde fryguy clawgrip and the big baddie wart have never been seen or heard from since
unlike fawful from the rpg series wart is not very distinguishable from bowser  theyre both big green reptiles
still i would love to see a return of wart and the other bossesstrangely enough to some gamespot in particular nintendos ingaural release in the advance series is a remake of super mario bros  from   yes pretty much everyone who is a fan of mario and nintendo know smb was originally released in japan as a famicom disk system title called yume kojo doki doki panic and originally featured nonmario characters it has since been revealed by nintendo that doki doki panic actually began development explicitly as a sequel to the original super mario bros even before the lost levels but they were having issues with the prototype and ultimately released the lost levels as the followup
however miyamoto and company always intended doki doki panic as a mario title
miyamoto has even stated in e  that next to the original super mario bros  is his favorite mario game
high praise indeedthat being said how does super mario advance stack up as a remake
well those looking for a straight port will be disappointed  super mario advance contains the most changes to the original game of all four advance games
we will get into the changes momentarilyfirst off you should know the game is based heavily off the version of super mario bros  found on super mario allstars
although gameplay was untouched in super mario allstars all four games smb lost levels smb and smb were given extensive graphical and audio upgrades with smb being the most drastic
nintendo has taken these upgrades several steps further touching gameplay in addition to the cosmeticslike super mario allstars the original nes title is not included
i wish they had included the original as an unlockable like they did with metroid  zero mission and the original metroid
although now available on the wii and wii u virtual console at the time of this games release that was still several years away
the only way to play the original nes title in  was either an emulator or a working neshere are the following changesin a precursor to comet and star coins found in all super mario titles between  there are five ace coins hidden throughout each level which when collected put a star on the level map and yield a upplayer begins with only one heart as opposed to the original two hearts
an extra mushroom appears in every level taking the total heart count from four to fivehearts which restore health appear much more often than in the original
hearts can also be pulled up from the earth and are called heartradishesthe intro to world  has been redesigned including a giant shyguy and a hill that bounces the player when stood uponthe jar interiors feature new music tracks and have been completely redesigned featuring shyguys riding ferris wheelssome ups have been moved from their original locations
others are encased in bubbles sitting on the ground which the player must throw three items to break the bubble and obtain the upthe game now strangely features points like the original super mario bros
if you get enough points by hitting multiple enemies with a single vegetable you are awarded an additional upgiant vegetables enemies and pow blocks are now present
carrots have also been added as a new vegetable platform but only appear in two levels and the red shells are much largerafter defeating wart two yoshi eggs appear in subcon in all twenty levels
just like pokemon you gotta catch em allthere are also numerous aesthetic changes as wellthe biggest change of them all at least in my estimation is a brand new boss called robobirdo
a robotic version of birdo this boss is a giant machine that now acts as the final guardian of world  replacing mouser
as of  super mario advance is the only appearance robirdo has made in a mario gamethis new boss is easily the best additiondeviation from the original game
notably the original second mouser battle that originally ended world  has been shuffled to world six replacing tryclyde
as a result mouser still appears twice just like the original nes super mario bros  and tryclyde has been reduced to only one boss battle which occurs in world in retrospect super mario bros  does feel as a somewhat strange choice as a launch mario title for the gameboy advance in  however the game proved to be a best seller and a players choice as well
if you love mario then i highly recommend you get this
you will greatly enjoy yourself
for those few gamers who are considering investing in the advance series and have not played super mario bros  in any of its vast incarnations most likely you will find the game entertaining as well if a tad different from the traditional mario formulai enjoy this game even though its a little difficult to play
i would recommend this to someone who enjoys the mario gamesmarios first appearance on the gba came with the first super mario advance game which is an updated port of super mario bros  for the original nintendo console
for those that dont know super mario bros  was a departure from the classic standard setting original game as mario now pulled radishes out of the ground to hurl at enemies among other changes the reason behind these is because the original super mario bros  was deemed too difficult when originally developed so another indevelopment game got a mario facelift and was released as super mario  here in the states while the other mario sequel would see somewhat of a release as super mario allstars on the lost levels segment but despite it all the game still offered some solid platforming action and fun
choosing to play as mario luigi toad or princess peach you hurl radishes and other items at enemies look for secrets and more besides
the game is pretty simple to get into and the graphics and sound have been updated for the gba but there are some flaws
the controls arent as tight as weve seen on mario games before and after this and there are moments where the game really doesnt feel like a mario game and its really not for reasons mentioned above but despite its flaws the first super mario advance is a fun diversion even though it is the weakest of the four super mario advance games that came out for the gba over its lifespan
all in all if youre still looking to get some quality triplea titles for your gba before it completely bites the dust heres one to pick up if you havent alreadysuper mario advance was one of the original release games for the gameboy advance system
a direct port of super mario brothers  from the original nintendo entertainment system super mario advance provides entertaining gameplay for those with fondness for the days of the bit gaming environment
playing as one of four characters mario luigi toad or the princess the player travels through land of dreams to battle an evil foe who wishes give everyone an unpleasant nights sleepas a part of the super mario series of games super mario brothers  is probably the least of the entire series
this version for gameboy advance does little to enhance the original
aside from slightly better graphics and sound its still basically the same game
there is a little side challenge of trying to collect these coins on each level but in truth the only reward for that is knowing that you found them all
there are no bonuses or special screens otherwise
it is still a fun game though and worth playing for those who have found memories of the old nes days
however if you are looking for new and challenging games this is probably not the right game for youwhat is there to say about this cartridge
first of all you are really getting two game super mario brothers  the snes version with some enhancements and a new upgraded version of mario bros besides the multiplayer modes and a few little extras here and there these are the same games they ever were
it might annoy people that they simply repackaged  old games but they are great games although mario bros is not quite as fun as i remember it but thats probably just me
smb is really and original sidescroller and the multiplayer games are fun and only require  cart
its not a new mario game which is disapointed but forgiveable
my main gripe is that they didnt really add much extra
a few new modes bosses an extra charcter minigames anything would have gone a long waysuper mario advance is a good game
there is an awesome multiplayer mode but if you dont have  friends with game boy advances then it loses some of its value
the fact that you can play with only  game pack is also cool
the actual single player game is a really good game but nothing really has changed since the nes version of this game
the graphics are also good and if you want a great platforming game then pick this game upthere have been a few negative reviews about this game but i love it
i know its not the bets mario game on the market but what do you expect from one of the first titles to be released
the graphics are good and gameplay is above standard and thats good enough for me
i just hope that they bring more mario games out on the gbait has been some time since i fired up my trusty old nintendo entertainment system blew the dust out of the huge cartridges and had at it
nevertheless i have recently played a few classic nes titles
here they are now with updated and improved graphics some cool new things to see and on a much smaller cartridge than the originalsuper mario advance is essentially the second of the vaunted mario bros series yes the  selling game series in history ported over to the gameboy advance
if you loved the classic as much as we all did youll love this too
if you didnt like it you are an outcast
just pretend you do so well still think youre coolthe only downside to this game pak is that if you played mario bros  so fanatically that every button press is permanently encoded into your brain as i did you might find that the same sequence still works
however you will also die several times as a result of picking up things that werent there before like the superhuge onions and the gigunto shyguys
the new things are enough to make it fun to play at least one more time and for those of you who were gasp born after the heyday of the great mario bros you will be required to play this at least once
dont complain youll enjoy every bit of it or die tryingthe gba is the newest wave in handheld video games and a sound investment for those who love the old snes games and the ability to take them anywhere with you
it also comes in verious colors but i prefer the glacieras most others already mentioned the display is not backlit
but either my eyes are exceptional or other peoples are really bad but i can see the games crystal clear
it is a trade off not having a backlit screen means that your batteries go further
anyone who remembers the game gear from sega surely can remember how it gobbled batteries up like mad
given a choice i would rather go with the nonbacklit screen
the old gameboy and gameboy color did fine without backlit screens so the gba doesnt suffer by not having onethe best thing about the gba is the gameplay
despite the small size you get amazing depth to your games
with super mario world a handheld version of the snes classic every apect of the original is preserved and the controls are like second nature
the graphics are bit but on the small screen they have the look and feel of bit
this is not a bad thing mind you but you cant expect playstation quality on a screen less than  inches tall and wide
the graphics are impressive enough but the sound quality blew me away
the music is amazingly audible and comes through with excellent claritywith an ever expanding library of games the gba is likely to live up to its older brother the gameboy and dominate the handheld video game market
despite the other complaints about the nonbacklit screen i think you will be suprised at the quality of this little system
if you can afford it buy the battery pak
youll save money in the long rungetting hold of a press pass for ects this year gave me the opportunity to play with the nintendos gameboy advanced probably the most interesting item on display on their stand they chose to show off the gamecube behind closed doors the day before
the first thing that struck me about the unit was how much it reminded me of the neo geo pocket colour which was available in this country for the last year
unfortunately snk choose to withdraw the neo geo from the western market and it leaves a clear path for nintendo to continue its domination of handheldsnintendo have opted for a silver colour for the body rather than the usual bright plastic toy colours it has been using on the colour unit for the past year
like the neo geo the machine is now horizontal with a widescreen tft lcd panel providing a very crisp display in the middle of the unit
buttons havent changed much sine the original gameboy below the screen theres the start and select button to the left hand side is the  direction joypad as with the gameboy this just isnt responsive or subtle enough to the right are the a and b buttons and two new additions are here in the form of a left and right shoulder buttonects had  games on show but due to the popularity of the stand i didnt get much chance to play them
the game i did have a go at was a fun puzzler currently going by the name of kuru kuru kururin
the object is to guide a rotating bar around a narrow maze never allowing it to touch the edges
the game is suprisingly tough requiring accurate timing and skilled control to keep your bar safe
its also highly addictive and will be a title sure to appeal to any fans of games like bustamove
the most popular game on show had to be mario kart advanced which was so crowded that i never got a chance to play
it was set up to show the  player capabilities of the unit when connected using its link cable
graphically the games impressive graphics are smooth sharp and detailed and it really shows the potential in the system
if its popularity was anything to go by its sure to be a successthough not shown here theres future promise for internet connectivity though how that will work out for the uk will remain to be seen bandai were showing off their wonderswan with internet connectivity but when i asked admited that there was no plans of a uk release for the machine
itll be cpable of hooking up with the gamecube much as the neo geo pocket can connect to the dc allowing trading between king of fighters data on the two platforms
battery life is a respectable  hours which isnt bad for a handheld and theres the handy option of a rechargable battery unit to save on cost
powered by a bit risc cpu the machine stocks a lot more power than its predecessor and any other handheld currently available
theres speculation that it may have some rudimentary d capabilities perhaps at the level of starfox on the sneswith no challenging handheld device in the western market now the gameboy advanced seems sure to win
im guessing the pricing point will be around  as the dollar price is expected to be at that price
nintendos main challenge will be pursuading gamers to upgrade but games like mario kart advanced seem a sure fire way of achieving this
screenshots from games in development at the moment all look colourful and imaginative so the unit has much promise
i think theres a lot to be said for describing this as the snes of the handheld worldthe game boy advance is pretty great
big library nice form factor etcthis doesnt have a backlit screen and takes normal aa batteries unlike the game boy advance sp
the battery life is excellent and it plays all game boy branded games although gbgbc games have a darker palette here than on the game boy color which is a little bit of an issue due to the nonbacklit screenand unlike the sp it has an ordinary headphone jack instead of needing to use the power adapter port with a converteralso gbgbc games stick out pretty far but this is true of all gbaspmicro systemsmine came in great condition little dirty from it being used but ok all buttons were working etcif you are willing to deal with the lack of a backlight an original gba is a pretty ok buy especially since they tend to be a bit cheaper
otherwise get the sp and if you really need to use headphones with it get the adapter for thatthe neogeo pocket far surpasses gba as a comfy and well designed portable but dead systems for nonimporters are just not much fun
the gba is nice but is about near impossible to see the screen unless direct sunlight is on it
some sort of contrast control would have been nice
worm style lights barely help
the game selection thus far is fairly typical of nintendo staid and for little kids
it is a good system and games like the miltary madness rip advance wars really shine on the hardware
the ability to play on multipule gbas from one cart is a great featurei give this product  stars instead of  because if you look at the picture you can see multiple colors on the screen
i thought the gameboy advance was going to be like a prototype for the ds one screen with a bunch of colors but i was wrong
you have to be by a light source like you do with the game boy and game boy color but still have the slight glare of the mentioned light on the screen
the games for the gba can be played on the ds bottom slot with a full array of color
the console works like new and plays games smoothly i just had a problem with the lack of brightnesscolor it had
it can play gb color games which is a plus if you want to play like games with a friend pokemon was my pick herei already have a game boy color snes wii and a ds for the reason that i am a big fan of nintendos line of work but for the time the gba came out i can say it was a leap forward same goes for n to the wiijom that was cool of you to buy your kids the gba and it is fun but make sure you are getting voted best mom for the right things not for buying your kids stufffancy platinum color aside the gba is great diversion to kill time with even if you are a something with kids like mei frequently end up with    minutes to kill while waiting around for something or another and having this gba around has totally taken the drag our of waitingif you plan to use your gba in this manner youll want to make sure that you buy games that are good in  minute increments and have a way to save completed levelsyoull also want a carrying case and a light since the gba is not back lit and lighting conditions vary so much from place to placebuy a nintendo title as your first game like super mario advance or super mario world
nintendo has defined this space and they definitely make good games to really get you hookedi bought this as a gift for a friend a couple of years ago
it got a lot of milliage and he used it quite a bit
still in great working condition it is now mine
my friend bought himself an gameboy advanced spnow this is a pretty good item especially if you want to use it in conjunction with the gamecube it makes final fantasy crystal chronicles quite a bit more fun
note you only use this on that game when playing multiplayer but it is necessary to have if you are playing multiplayernow for the big question is it worth  more dollars to get a cooler gameboy that is backlit
i think the answer is yes
especially if you are considering buying this for a friend or child go with spit is a great system although i always need to turn the lamp on when playing it
the controls are kind of hard to use but in a way that is a good thing because it will take longer to beat games
my ffavorite game is sonic advance
its like a regular sonic game and the graphics and music are incredible
a must have for any car ride airplane ride dorm roomhotel roometc
my parents are mad because i bought one but who caresi bought this for my youngest son it works well
came quick
thanks for ur service
i would eecommend againi can remember hearing about the gameboy advance months before its release
i waited for the release day making a point to put away money from my job so could buy it
when i bought it i was not disappointed with the system and the power it offersthe system is more powerful than the snes was
bearing this in mind one can only guess where this thought is going
the snes has one of the greatest selections of games
because of its great graphical power it was able to excel for years in the gaming market providing gamers with a wide array of beautiful games
gba offers all the snes offers and much morethe launch games for the system demonstrated its power coming to the level of the super nintendo with ease
as time has passed the games have become more intricate further utilizing the systems power
as of now april  the system offers a wide array of new games as well as rereleases of classics from the super nintendonow the problem with this edition of the gameboy advance console is that it requires exquisite lighting  which is not available at all times
however nintendo has already fixed this issue by creating the new edition of gba game boy advance spall in all i suggest the purchase of a game boy advance unit
if you have the money buy the sp console
however if you dont have the money to sink into such a purchase i still highly suggest that you buy the standard gba console
it is a buy that you will not regretthis one is much better than the gbc because the sceen is much bigger and the graphics and sound is much better
the bad things about it is that like the old one the screen is hard to see but they do make a light to put on top of it
the controls r hard to use and the buttons sometimes stick but it does wear down
i love the headphone slot so u dont have to hear anyone say turn it down
after a while the light that says how much battery life u have left gets broke so when u tap the gba or shake it the light flickers from full charge to red
the games r good on this too and there r too many to name
that is why i loved the gba for a long timeon my first review i posted fair because the game worked
but came dirty and cracked in some spots and missing a battery cover
i cleaned it up and such
they company contacted me and offer me refund but i denied it because they didnt have any new game boys so i kept the one they sent me
the reason i change it to i like it is because they did contact me to fix the issueonce again nintendo continues to prove why it is the dominant leader in the video game industry
other systems come along with more publicity or promises of flashier gameplay and titles but nintendo keeps moving along and defeated all challengers
its most recent fullsize console gamecube has more than held its own against its fancier competition of playstation  and xbox owing the superior quality of titles and better gameplaynow in the handheld arena nintendo continues to monopolize the market in a way that has discouraged any other video game manufacturers from trying to compete
with gameboy advance nintendo has managed to produce a handheld device that would go toetotoe with midgeneration fullsize consoles like playstation  super nes and all sega platforms
gameboy has been around since the late s and despite being viewed as a lesser gaming system with competitors like sega gamegear atari lynx and turbografx  it somehow managed to be the only one left standing
once again this is a tribute to superior quality of game titles and better gameplay
really the only knock on the earlier generations of gameboys was that the games they could play were limited in scope by the technology at the time
versions of the super mario games play action football and castlevania were subdued versions of their nes and supernes counterparts though i really did like castlevania  for gameboy
that problem does not exist anymore
gameboy advance now carries titles that are direct ports of original nes and supernes titles
super mario world the legendary game on which all future supernes titles were judged translates perfectly onto gameboy advance
the gameplay and levels are all identical with even a little improvement in graphics and features like a feature to save at anytime
what is even more amazing is that not only is gameboy advance perfectly regenerating earlier titles but that they are going after the big boys of modern systems
in november gameboy advance will be releasing its own version playstation s landmark game grand theft auto 
while there will have be some scaledbacked concessions made to accommodate gbas design it will still be an amazing accomplishment to port a version of that game for a handhelddespite all the gushing there is one area where gba is lacking and cost it a star rating
that has to do with lighting
the gba is not a backlit system
therefore the user will have to make sure they are in good light to play this system
there are some lighting devices available for the gba that can improve that lighting but be wary of the which one you get
i tried the wormlight and found that all it did was increase the glare on the screenbut i digress
this is a wonderful system
the current titles provide hours of compelling gameplay and the promise of future titles will keep gameboy advance at the forefront of the handheld revolution for years to comealthough we all loved the classic blackandwhite fat grey gameboy we all agreed it needed some advancements
when gameboy pocket came along the portable system actually became portable and easy to lug around
next came gameboy color which brought basic colors to the world of portable gaming
once gba came out it was all over
incredible graphics for a console of its size more than mechanical now almost melodic music and a convienient switch to a horizontal hold makes the gba an ingenious sequel to our favorite portable console
if you havent yet upgraded do so today and fab up your portable funas with the old gameboy one of the flaws is a small hard to read screen which tends toward the dark side
of course this is necessary to preserve battery life since it operates on  aaalso the battery cover breaks easy but at least thats solved by buying the spare rechargeable battery which also takes the place of the coverput it simplythis is a great edition to the nintendo franchise
advance has a great line up of games likemetroid zero missionadvance warsthe mario games and zelda games
awesome must have handheld for this year and if you dont already have it get sp then out of a great hand held to owni love game boy advance
the graphics and sound are so much better than game boy color
however i dont see much point of the platinum edition
my brother bought this version since it came out right around his birthdaypros great sound and graphics plays most game boy color game boy and all game boy advance games
i tested the game boy and game boy color if you buy the right game link cable you can connect a gba to a gbc small and portable great for tripscons burns batteries quick not much point in getting a different color unless you like silver
plain looking lack of other colorsgame boy advances are great i highely reccomend one
make your decision for this color based on if it appeals to you
unless you are a collector i dont see much point in getting such a plain color if secretly in your mind you want another color
i honestly dont like the color of the platinum version however right now for a limited time it is available with a free light which is a great deal
but you need to make sure you copy the code for the light and put it in your cartso if i like it so much why only  stars
well nintendo doesnt make any decent rechareable battery packs for gba so im mad at themi really like the gameboy advance console i had one before and it was really fun to play with yeahi remember the original game boy like it was yesterday
prone to long car trips  my father bought me one when it first came out
each set of batteries could provide more than  hours of cheap entertainmenti never replaced the original system
through the game boy pockets and colors  i stuck to the original
that hardware was meant to last  and saw action through more than a decade of changes
i never though id want or need to replace itwell  out with the old and in with the new
game boy advance is high powered hardware at a reasonable price  offering many options that make it well worth it
the  bit processor gives it the same power as a ps one
this is a huge update from the older models  which had roughly the same processing power as the original nesthe larger  full color screen is great  but also has the flaw of being really dark
even playing in well lit areas or with game lights  some games  such as castlevania  will still appear too dark
the gamelights offered can as much as half the battery life of the system as wellthe library of games includes many retro bit snes titles carted to the portable format
in addition  new titles aimed specifically for the tecnology of the gba are being released all the time
you can even play your old game boy and gb color gamesone quick downside is that six button games such as the street fighter  cart dont translate well to the four button system
this is only a problem with some games  but can be frustratingmany games for the gba are great fun  and feature addictive gameplay
the compact nature of the system  its long battery life  and gameplay will make it fun for a long timethe gameboy advance is the best pocket system ever with its fun comfertable desing and great selecton of games
it comes in many different colors has exeilent graphics and is light small and portable
the screen is a desent size though reqiuers a large amount of light and theres to many side scrolling games
other than that its perfecti tend to carry it everywhere and will quickly slip into antisocial mode as i crush opposing forces in advance wars or slam a volley ball into canadians in super dodge ball advance
i wholly plan to get mario kart and am looking forward to more quality titles on this little powerhousethe only complaint is the same one you read everywhere else no internal light
you will have to tip the angle quite a bit and sometimes your arms will get tired from holding the game boy in some contorted way to let you seebut anyway this is a great little system and well worth the investmentgood just about everythingbad i dont like the coloringwhich means it rulesgreat games and great feel
not to akward to hold and the colors are not that bad
downside screen is rather dark
positive hard to break it unless you crack the screen
sound quality is alright its not top notch but good for its day and agethe gameboy advance offers a lot more features to date than it did when it first came outoriginal featuresthe gba allows you to play all gameboy gameboy color and gameboy advance games on the one system
the graphics color and sound have greatly improved over the gameboy color
and even when you play an old gameboy or gameboy color game on the gba the graphics are enhanced unlike if you played it on the old systemthe design of the system is well done making it easy to hang onto for extended gameplay
there are also several colors to choose from platinum indigo white pink ect
also there are exclusive store colors such as red for target and black for toys r usyou can link up systems with a link up cable and play with your friends up to  players depending on which game you havealso you can hook up an ereader to your gba and slide a special ereader card through it to play even more gamesthere are even more features coming out to the gbanewer featuresa recent game that has come out boktai for the gba comes with a built in sunsensor
if you play in the sunlight your character becomes more powerful
another newer reason to own a gba is the new games coming out that require having a gba to play multiplayer on the gamecube
these games include final fantasy crystal chronicles and zelda four sword for gbamissing featuresomething i find extremely tedious to about the gba is there is no backlight
this means it is very hard to see your game screen
there are flood lights and worm lights that slightly help but not nearly enough
luckily the gbasp has changed this and added the backlightdont like handheld systems or are torn between them
so perhaps you have a gamecube and dont like the idea of handheld games but want to play all the gameboy color and advance games the stores have to offer
check out the gameboy player retailed at about 
attach it to your gamecube and now you can play all the gameboy games of your dreamsownership i own the indigo color but they are all greatin  the eggheads at nintendo had the brilliant idea of squeezing their best console titles into the small screen and changing portable gaming forever and this is the resultahead of its timeat the timethe game boy advance packs a powerful bit computer and a wide ergonomic design for not cramping your fingers while playing super mario world on the bus
its this system that was also the testbed for new gaming tech from the gamecube cable that turned the gba into a substitute controllerscreen to experimental wireless adapters that set the groundwork for what would become nintendos ds family
and one cant forget its compatibility with the entire game boy library flooding game shelves with a virtual smorgasbord
at  hours the battery lifes not bad either no power outlet thoughso the gbas most obvious detriment is its lack of screen lighting and protection
the game boy sp solves both problems but lacks a headphone jack
the game boy micros too micro and the ds plays its own titles and the gbas but not much else
i reiterate cant have it allthis system is recommended for players over if you are a racing fan this is a must have
you need to be alert and ready for difficult turns
it is a little frusterating being that the first tracks can stll be a little difficult
it is the type of game where you get sooo far and one little mess up messes the whole thing up
you know those games where you want to throw your controller across the room because you are so mad
this is one of them
the only problem is that your controller is the system itself
so if you love racing and have a good temper you will love it
if not well wrap your gba in some bubble wrap before handwell what can i say  i bought the game boy advance early at an import store and payed the rediculous cost of price two months before it came out and saw it on ebay for significantly less
but i needed a game and the one that i figured would need the least reading being a japanese imported game in japanese was this racing game
there may be some differences between this and the american version particullarly in the difficulty
the japanese game is hard
after beating the first  tournaments made up of  races on three different difficulty settings it finally gives you a new tournament and new cars which arent incredibly much better than the ones you start with
the rumoredhighest difficulty setting hasnt been reached as far as from people i know because all you get for beating the th tourney is another difficulty level
but all in all this games graphics and sound really show off the power of the system
ive seen mario advance in action but this game really blows it away
there is a lot of pixelation as things get closer but that can be expected
why didnt nintendo put a d chip in their system
well hope you like this game and keep your eyes open for sonic advancei bought this hoping for the best and it was just about what i thought
it is a very fast paced game the controls take some practice
good graphics and descent sound effects
you better excercise your thumb if you dont want to cramp upthis game is great but its really hard  sooooo it will last you for a long time tring to beat it and its great to just pop in race a few laps then go play something elsethe multiplayer is great to play with your friendsat first this game was pretty hard for meit was a little too fast at first and i wasnt used to the tracks but after a while it became sort of a breeze and i got to the last level of bishopdont worry though it isnt so easy that its boringyou still have to try to place first and the speed is pretty challengingthe graphics are in the classic f zero style and i think its actually the fastest f zero game ive playedits destined to become a classic like the f zero predecessor but it isnt the best f zero gamethat title must be put onto f zero x for the nintendo  i was  a bit disappointed that the cars in maximum velocity didnt have characters
the characters of f zero are part of its charmf zero x and f zero gx both have tons of characters and those games are a little more exciting visually than this one but still this is a great gamethe gameplay on this game is one of the best
it is very fun and there is almost unlimmited replay value because there are many ships to unlock
with some of the ships it is hard to turn while with the others it is almost impossible to turn without banging into the wall
the graphics of the track could use a little work but the ships have very good graphics
this game is very challenging in the beginning but you should get used to the difficult controls if you work at it
i would recommend that you buy this game but the price is a little high for the value
i would buy it usedthe first f zero is just classic cause you can play the first really fast racer of all time its a classic just like star fox and super mario worldits almost impossible to resist the temptation to play as anyone other than captain falconf zero on the gameboy advance is an excellent title as it has everything that you want from a game
f zero is not too easy but you have different difficulty levels anyway so everyone will be able to play on their level
you have to use the shoulder buttons to help you turn around corners which make the game more slick
there is an added feature of being able to link this game and gba with other people who own this game so you can battle it out against each other to se e who really is the bestfor starters this does not add single player missions that are quiet like the original ones not only that the virtual voyager mode does contain some bugs which happen while new decks are loadinglike freezes crashes to main menu and desktop it adds a virtual vyager of decks   and  it has  new holoprograms that are a captain proton mission klingon compound attack a garden program with boothby waling around where you get attacked by bio hulks and a program called borg slayer which is third person and is sort of a maze
single player also has a lot of stuff you can collect on different deckslike a raven plaque and elite force action figures that will all end up in your quarters
the game also has a lot of new skins modes that are a team fortresswhich is calle specialties eliminationif youre killed you dont return to the game disintergrationone shot kills and everyone with phaser rifles action heroyou are either action hero with all the guns killing other or other people trying to kill action hero to become action hero yourself and the long awaited assimilationyou are either borg queen trying t assimilate everyone or starfleet trying to kill the borg queen but sadly all of the multiplayer options can be found in the  patch with a few tweaks overallif you want to just walk around voyager even beaming into some spots and find a bunch of stuff and play some holo missionsshort and relatively easythis is for you if you expect a totally new experience and a bunch of normal alien killing sngle player missions keep waiting for elite force it is a good plot and a good game too
the end boss is very hard which is bad because if you cant beat the end boss it is very bad but you can defeat the end boss if you cheatwell i must say the elite force expansion pack is a whole lot of fun for about an hour
then it kind of gets old
sure walking the ship freely is great but the original elite force is still the best
either way i still recommend buying this if you love the gamepro brings a game boy game to the big screen without the fear of having the batteries run low in the middle of your gamecon does not play game boy color games unfortunately although it does display certain game boy games in limited color if they were designed for thati bought this game for my dad a longtime fan of the tv show
a new pc user he had no problem getting the hang of the controls in this user friendly game
i am giving this game a great rating because of how much my dad is enjoying it
the only complaint ive ever heard is that the wait between questions is longer than it should be  all that pomp and circumstance with the music and switching views
another great feature is that you can avoid question boredom and repetitiveness by downloading new questions
get it
play it
you wont be disappointedgreat gameused to own this on pcbut thats vanished and its just as good on ps as i rememberbesides the sweet mouse controlas far as fps go this has got to be one of the most indepth and most amazingly beautiful games i have played on the ps
this game is very involved and provides a well written story as well
red faction is extremely fluid and has the cool feature of being able to blow up just about anything and being a doom graduate this game is a fresh breath to fps
this game has alot to offer the only problem i had with this game was the learning curve both with the controller and when you try a higher difficulty level
it tends to be a bit steep
there is a ton of replay value as well with this game so if you dont have this one in your library go out and get this one now
you will not be disappointedi just got this game todayits great
but i was expecting  frames per second like timesplitters
but its about  and it doesnt slow down that much
the graphics are goodand about that geo mod technology you cant destroy everythingstill this game is great
some great features is the ability to save your game anywhere
awesome weapons and smart ai too
well im glad i bought thisits worth itokay i really am enjoying this game
i bought it friday  couldnt play it until late saturday was cooking on the grill all day
started playing it and was enjoying every minute of it
may be a lil easy for some but was what i needed timesplitters has really been kicking my tail on the medium levels
some part are a lil confusing  but thats because your so used to the action your not ready to take some time and think it through
i dont know who said it was slow but they were wrong the enemies are not as agressive as timesplitters but i dont think they should be
i have only made it as far as the submarine but hey im over thirty and have to go to work sometime
this was an overall worthy purchase
i didnt want to give it  stars cause i havent gotten to the ending yet so far i am enjoying it
i do believe its better than quake iiinow this is more like it
ps games of late have been plagued by the curse of brevity
after a string of incredibly short games such as onimusha zoe crazy taxi and starfigher ps owners finally have a reason to use their memory cards
red faction goes a long way towards remedying the quotbeaten in one sittingquot trend with a long storyline full of twists turns and a huge variety of environments to explore
what starts out as a revolution in the mines of mars eventually sees you raiding ultors corporate offices piloting submarines fighting huge mutant worms sneaking aboard a space ship and blowing up a huge spacestation
and thats not even the games brutal down in the trenches finale
red faction is a long game and just when you think its going to end youre surprised by yet another twist in the plot
its also a fun game and with the inclusion of a variety of vehicles and the quotgeomodquot technology a fairly innovative onespeaking of which a lot has been made about the geo mod technology
while it is very rewarding to blow the bridge out of personel transports and take out guard towers at their foundations red faction hardly capitalizes the possibilities of being able to alter the environmentthe quotrevolutionquot has also been a major tag line for this game
while that is all well and good for the storyline dont expect any of the other members of red faction to help you ala the martians in quotperfect darkquot
your fellow rebels are really nothing more than cannon fodder pretty much dying without fail seconds after you encounter them
while this isnt a huge problem a huge battle between your fellow proletarian miners and the brutal security force would have been very cool and was in fact expected based on the previewsthe multiplayer game is also somewhat disappointing but thats okay
red faction replaces the pointlessness of fpss like time splitters with a fairly entertaining story that actually rewards you for continuing on
its certainly no goldeneye or perfect dark but its definately a start for shooters on the psthis game has next to no flaws and is definately a great game
the only thing i found wrong with the game is that it seemed too short and it left me wanting more at the end
the story
you take on the role of parker a minor on mars for ultor corporation
people looking to make some money go to mars to work in the mines and are supposedly treated very well
parker arrives there to find that everything he has been told is untrue
the food is horrible the barracks is horrible and the gaurds regularly beat on the miners just for kicks
a rebel group knows as red faction stars posting flyers promoting their cause
one day parker witnesses the beating of another miner
a riot breaks out as members of red faction begin assulting the gaurds and attempting to break from ultors control
parker caught up in the chaos has one choice
kill or be killedthroughout the game you are contacted by red faction with objectives of sorts
few of these objectives require stealth however so the game is mostly just run in and blow everything up
weapons range from control batons to rocket launchers
you also have the opportunities to control vehicles during the game such as a atv a aesir fighter jet and a submarine all of which have their own unique weapons
the geo mod technology this and red faction  are the only games that use geo mod allows you to blow up almost everything and by doing so you may uncover special items
there is almost nonstop action and the frame rate never falters
the only downside to all this greatness is the game loads often quick little loads rather than huge waits
the graphics are amazazing considering geo mod is fairly new and the sound and music goes well with the gamethere is a multiplayer mode that allows  human players and  bots
if youve ever played halflife online with other people this is practically the same
its a fast paced kill fest and the only way out it to win
the only mode is deathmatch
the multiplayer isnt that great on the ps and if you want a real multiplayer experience i would buy the pc version which allows several players simultaneouslyif you like games where your objective is to kill kill kill then this is the game for you
the game is fairly short and will leave you wanting more at the end but it is definately a jump in the right direction for ps first person shooter gamesthis game sets the standards for fps on consoles
this game is nearly flawless but the few flaws it does have tend to make this game a near missthe flaws are this way too short first of all
i played this game thoroughly and religiously taking in each scene exploring and of course kicking butt
i still was able to beat this game with about  hours or so of game play
mind you that was on the easiest difficulty but i dont feel compelled to go to the harder settings because there is simply no reward or reason for doing so
that brings me to the second flawthe second flaw is a pathetic let down and super quick anticlimactic ending
there is no ending its as simple as that
there isnt even a trick like some other games where if you win at a higher difficulty then you see a better ending
this is a trend that keeps showing up
game programmers please give us players the closure and fulfillment to your games
when i beat this game  and i was shocked that i had already come to the end  that alludes to the third flaw
way too short
at the higher difficulties it takes longer because of course hits hurt you more and you are given less ammo
really i have seen plenty of ps games that are longer than thisthis game wins you over right away when you are allowed to customize the controls to a tee
its little details like that and the addition of the training room that showed me that the creators really put a lot of love and care into this game
thats why i was so stunned at the lack of ending and shortness of the game
the graphics and sounds and game play are fluid and top notch
this is the kind of game the ps needs more of in any genre
crank this thing on  and you will literally start to sweat because it sounds so real
the multiplayer is fun but a bit limited
the multiplayer levels certainly are not goldeneye or perfect dark but are adequate enough for a quick tussle
even with the above misgivings i still can recommend that anyone purchase this game without hesitation
thats how good it still is
this game is a few steps away from being a classic
its too bad they didnt give themselves another couple of months or so to polish this thing off a touch more
i cant wait to see what comes in the wake of this gameive had my ps for about  months now and honestly have not been overly impressed with anything
i dont know what i was expecting  but it hasnt kept me glued to my television and taking days off of work
this game has finally caught my attention and held onto it
if youve read any other reviews by me youll note that i loved halflife  best pc game ever in my opinion
while this is no halflife it is a lot of fun if you like fpss
the controls are easy to use the environments are amazing and the sound is great
the action is a lot of fun and the ability to blow away walls is very coolwhats it missing
its missing the suspense and tension of hl
its missing the unique enemies of hl its all variations on guards as opposed to different monsters guards and aliens
but it is still the most fun ps game out there
if you have a ps you must get this gamei dont have a lot of gaming experience and i tend to guage all fps against quotmedal of honorquot which was the greatest game id ever played
red faction ranks right up there with it
one of the things that jumped out at me immediately was the ability to save at any point in the game without having to complete a mission
this was first console game i encountered with that feature and i love it
i wish all game designers would do that
in fact this game is really a continuous quotmoviequot without true mission levels in the traditional sensethe game is engaging and addictive and fairly long and complex
im stunned by some reviews that say this game is too short 
its hard to put the controller down once you get started
on the easy level its relatively easy until later into the game but you can adjust the difficulty setting if you require more of a challengethe graphics are great although the hype over the quotgeomodquot is a bit over done
i had a little trouble at first with the controls but with practice that was overcome
i really didnt find too many flaws other than a mission or two where you have to give up your weapons and be quotstealthyquot hey i love shooting thingsthis is a good solid game that will provide hours of funnot being a fan of first person shooters i was really surprised at how cool this game is
i really enjoyed how you play in a total d all direction type of game
the new geo mod is something that is long over due with first person shooters
if you dont like going one direction you can blow holes in the walls with explosives or your rocket launcher and go another waycool story line i also really love the different type of vehicles you can use to run over or blow up the enemy
 out of  stars if you are a first person shooter fan this is a must havered faction is a new species of first person shooter fps
red faction introduces something called geomod technology
this means that you can blow up the environment with certain weapons
this is a nice addon but is not used to its full potential during the story mode
you have a full array of weapons to dispose of the hundreds of enemies that get in your way
this game is set in the notsodistant future on mars
you are parker a rebelious son who in an attempt to upset his parents joins ultor a mining station on mars
it turns out ultor makes life in the mines a living hell
also at the same time a plague is killing off thousands of miners every day
after witnissing a fellow miner get beaten by an ultor guard you decide to join the red faction a group of revolting miners led by the mysterious eos
your missions range from sabotaging an energy plant to using stealth to infiltrate the administrating area
there are also five vehicles at your disposal
each adds a cool feature to the game but like the geomod they are there just there as bells and whistles
rarely is it actually necessary to use a vehicle although sometimes they are helpfulred faction is a medium length game for an fps
it took me  hours to complete
its a fun game but isnt a huge breakthrough from any other fps
i think if you are really into fps you will enjoy this game a lot so go ahead join the red factionred faction is a first person shooter set on mars in the notsodistant future
i have two words for you  deformable terrainthe game has amazing graphics as youd expect on a ps a decent soundtrack and an involving storyline
youre in a mining colony on mars
the colony has a mysterious plague wiping people out and an underground movement is pointing out that the mining corporation isnt very ethicalso you get sucked into the revolution against the company and are being helped out by the rebels
theres really cool glassshattering effects submarines to ride in ultor corporation baddies to blow away and the plague to figure out
lots of weapons and levels to plow throughbut what makes this game so much better than its halflife siblings is the terrain
in say halflife or most other games of this ilk you shoot a wall and it gets charred
you can leave bullet holes in things or maybe shoot out the window
red faction brings this to an entirely new level by letting you modify the terrain with your attacksyes this means if someone has locked a door you want to get through you blast out the wall next to the door and go through the hole youve made
know that the room below you has something special in it
blast a hole into the floor
trying to negotiate across a room
be careful because your enemies could cave the floor in beneath youit turns what was before a go through this maze in this order kind of game into a you have this huge d space use your brain to figure out how best to reach your objectives
its amazing how much this expands the gametheres a two player death match mode and  levels of gameplay
well well worth the money  and watch for red faction  coming soonok the storys a little cheesy but its a great st person shooter and the geomod rocks
i dont need keys anymore
also the game gets harder and harder and harder
while some people would throw their ps out the window during the last few msiions i find it challenging
save often is the secret to winning this game
the bosses are godlike in this game also
incredibly hard
only problem with this game is the controls which reminded me of resident evil
ugh
oh well i got used to it after a whilethis game overal is a good game with no flaws realy exept u might get stuck when the way is right under ur nose
the story line was pretty good could of been beter but its ur basic rebelion exept its on mars
u can save anywhere u please which is good
but it felt as if something was missing it just wasnt fun enough to give it a five
i played this game once and probaly will never play it again
if u played and love first person shooters u should get this game if ur new to the gaming world this is still a good game to getmaybe its just that i just got done playing metalgearsolid  and  so it brings this game downgive it a try even thoughi never was into fps becides red faction the only fps i have gotten into was quake  for playstation but i have always wanted to play halflife i heard it was great
so far this is the best fps for ps and one of the best games for ps
what i know this game will change gaming as we know it not just for fps but all types of gaming
imagine if armored core had the geomod engine or if resident evil had geomod it would be great fun and change the form of gaming forever
the game is not totally original but i like it and i hope that other games will incorporate the geomod engine to its full extentive never really like first person shooters
this game my first real first person shooter i ever bought and completed was really enjoyable
for a greatest hits game it provides good value and good fun
i appreciated it as a learning tool yes i did it on easy and as a game itselfthere were some problems with this game though
it tried to emulate an adventure and stealth game within a first person shooter
this was done very poorly and destroyed much of the continuity
this sometimes meant annoying backtracking and pointless exploration
other times it meant that if you cant continue unless you got a certain vehicle or hit a certain button
the stealth aspect is the worse
i felt it was clumsy and completely arbitrary when a guard saw you or not
luckily i downloaded a walkthrough which reduced much of this drudgery
also the vehicles are clunky boring and take away from the flow as wellnow to the good part
while not a huge graphical achievement it was still very smooth and there was no clipping slowdown or bad camera angles
not stunning but still very polished nonetheless
the controls were a bit tough to get use to but if you havent engrained yourself to the pc controls the transition is not bad at all
the auto aiming provides a bit of ease to itthe best way to describe the feel is to think of the movie total recall without arnold or the freaks
youre a revolutionary in the mars mines fighting your way through
you travel through mines caves high tech buildings hospitals space station and through water
the scenery is sometimes chilling sometimes peaceful sometimes ruddy
it all works well with the mood of the game
the computer ai is decent eg
the dont run right into ambushes or get trapped in corners or behind walls and the weapons offer a bit of varietythere are no real levels in this game but about  load points to go through
this provides a huge area to pass
saving can be done at any place which is a huge huge plus
there are only two bosses so its good to know it doesnt rely on the old tired gaming clicheacutefinally it has difficulty levels
im new to first person shooters so i choose easy
maybe it was a bit hard at some points while it was a way too easy at most other points but its better than being frustrated beyond belief
if youre masochistic or an expert you can move up to a more difficult position
either way everyone will be satisfiedthis game also has the standard multiplayer mode
you can compete against another player or against computer players
the levels are fun and its good to get way to practice or get some aggression outin short its a very good game for everyone
if you want a fun small adventure choose easy and download a walkthrough
if you want a challenge choose the impossible level and try to figure out those little puzzle and stealthsproscontrols are not badsmooth and polishedgreat valuelarge and varied environmentsconspointless searchingvehicles clunky and forced uponstealth base action clumsy annoyingdifficulty not spread evenlytime to complete  hours walkthrough and easy leveldifficulty level varies from really easy to really hardfrustration level mediumi consider red faction a classic d fps during what i call the golden age of fpss
games like deus ex half life timesplitters unreal tournament and quake  arena were the  games that my generationn grew up on and played incessantlyat its core red faction is a rather straight forward fps
the story is a classic one man vs the world narrative set in the future on mars
parker is the player character a young guy who found a mining job on the red planet dissatisfied with what his parents have forced him to do with his life
the mining company he works for is a corrupt organization that treats its miners like slaves which prompts an uprising from a group called the red faction whom parker is a part ofthe one part of the overall story and experience is this the reason i said one man against the world is because during actual gameplay you are literally there doing all the work that the red faction group should be doing together
sabotaging this kidnapping this person control these tanks and subs flying into space and assassinating this person
it reminds me an awful lot like master chiefs role
the rf members that do appear in levels are completely worthless usually taking one or two hist from a pistol and dying
i didnt very much feel like i was from this griup
i was feeling more like a guy taking his revenge against the company and its headhonchosgraphically this was an impressive outing for its day
the character models and player weapon hand remind me of half lifes quite a bit
the world space is moderately pleasent to look atgiven the fact a large part of the game is set inside tunnels inside a red planet
colors are well balanced animation is nothing suprising
i have no issues with this game  years on besides the expected aliasing annoyance on hdtvscontrols in red faction are fairly comfortable
i think this game and many like were ttying to find and set a basic control scheme for fpss on the ps
you jump and crouch with the l buttons cycle weapons with the left and right dpad and fine aim with the up dpad
i found them suprisingly intuitive when playing not getting nervous and trying to remember how to do something in a tough spotgameplay itself is a fun ride
its one of those fast paced fps experiences made great by the unreal quake and timesplitters series
auto aim setting can really be a life saver
something that suprising that shouldnt was that there is no stealth mechanic whatsoever
you literally cannot crouch sneak from a tunnel  ft above an enemy  ft across from you without him saying come with me miner and shooting
the famous geo mod mechanic where nearly any structure ingame is destructable was a fun little addition
you never really need to use it unless to make a certain boss fight or a locked door issue easieri have to make a special section here for voice acting
i dont think ive ever heard such a difference of quality from the main character acting and everyone elses voice acting
parkers voice and dialogue are some of the worst ive heard
when someone is talking to him he literally says all the wrong things
he is incredibly awkward
his facial emotions dont help either
 into the game there is a scene that just blew my mind all from parkers lines
once you watch it youll know
aside from him the rest of the cast is enjoyablein multiplayer i wasnt expecting much and didnt get much
its all deathmatch focused with quite a few arenas to choose fron that werent really shown in the single player game
playing with  friends and bots really made me wish for more weapons since most arenas are pretty large and with lots of cover to blow upeven with a few ideas not completely fleshed out like red faction in my opinion can stand toe to tie with many of the early shooter heavyweightsi just got red faction a few days ago but it has already caused me trouble
the day i got it i didnt go to sleep when i should have and then today a few days later i was playing and got so wrapped up that i was almost late for worki was going to start this review off with the good news about this game but there is a lot of that and very little bad so i guess ill start off with the bad and work my way up to the goodthe bad news is that this is one of the first console first person shooter fps game that isnt really designed for multiplayer and since i am a huge fan of multiplayer games and not quite as much of a one player game person this was quite a disappointment
there just arent the gameplay options that time splitters or even unreal tournament have
if you are looking for a good multiplayer game go with time splittersthere are also a few other minor bad points in the game but several of those revolve around the fact that this is not really a multiplayer game
things such as the limited number of characters that you have to choose from in multiplayer when you first start off and the amount of time it takes to finish the game to get all the characters and levels something that i have not even attempted yet so i am not really sure that is what you have to dothat just about sums up the bad stuff now on to the good stuffgeo mod technology is great
if you like the big explosives if you are thinking about purchasing this game then you probably do then this game is the right one for you
imagine a huge rock platform suspended by three stone walkways
now imagine what would happen if you wer eto start shooting rockets at those three walkways
what do you think should happen
well if you were playing goldeneye perfect dark half life unreal tournament time splitters or any other fps then maybe the color of the walkways would change but in this game they blow up
and when all of them are gone what happens
it floats in the air becuse some idiot programmer didnt think about gravityfooled you
it falls down
it acctually falls down and you can see the bits and pieces of it scattered all over the placethe weapons in this game are also great
personally i dislike the outrageous weapons you can pick up in game slike perfect dark
sure they are cool and all but make things a bit ridiculous
i especially like that it is almost impossible to hit someone with a rocket and the remote mine sare big and dont throw very far
i think it would be a little tough to hit someone with a rocket and goldeneyes and perfect darks mines are just too tiny for their power and can be thrown wat too farthe only other thing i can say about this game is not good or is it bad
that is the length of the game
there are something like  areas and  something objectives in the game
if you are playing for the multiplayer portion it is bad but if you are only looking for the single player aspect it provides hours of funso if you are looking for a good single player fps for ps then red faction is the game you want
if you want multiplayer then go with time splitters or if you like red faction and you want the multiplayer options look into unreal tournament
unreal doesnt have geomod and i dont particularly like the game that much but it is similar in character and weapon style as well as having similar controls and gameplaythis game is stupid whatever you do dont buythis game it sucksgraphics   good character designs pictures backgrounds and sets
satisfying and not too blocky
one of the only areas this game fully hardout excels in is its bloody good graphicssound   great character voices as usual and some characters have neat tools like bangers or stakes which allow the sound to get carried away with a fabulous calmnessvalue   not worth playing unless your getting sick of the wwf games or crash bash
fun stuff but not for everyone
i would only buy it for a under priceoverall   fun to play with a lot of people
its is awesome to see those memorable simpsons characters in fistaction but this still has some things it needs to work on
i think simpsons wrestling needs more modes and some better designs
still it is good funif you loved rayman for playstation but wished you could play it on boring car or plane journeys then this is what you are looking for
it is exactly like the playstation game except you play it in a smaller system
if you hated the playstation version youll hate this unfortunatelydespite the age of this games original version on playstation this is still a very entertaining platform game
of course it has some significant issues which i will now talk aboutthis game first of all is not easy
there are many places during the course of the game where you may get frustrated with the difficulty of the level
its not that its hard to figure out what to do to finish the level its that its difficult accomplishing what is obviously necessary to advance through the level
while the levels can be tough to get through practice and memorizing will get you through eventuallya second problem is the fact that extra lives are very difficult to come across and once you get them finish the level and then save there is no getting them back
this forces the player to gather  tings in order to get extra lives if you cant locate the actual extra lives
another problem is the fact that i dont think there is any way to get continues back after you have used themthis game is also pretty short
while it very attractive visually this means that there was less room available to make lots of levels at least that is my own theory
this is not like super mario world where there are more than fifty if memory serves levels in the game
while short it is still challenging enough to require a considerable amount of time to completeall in all this is a very good game to buy if youre into platform games
even if you have it playstation it is worth getting a portable version
despite it problems this is still a game that should be in every gba collectionthis game is good
the only complaint i could possibly mention is the length
but what it lacks in length it makes up for in difficulty
anyone who says this game is easy is either a master fps player or theyre not playing on difficult level
why play if you play on medium or easy
you might as well just play a disney gamein my mind this is an essential element to the halflife series
mainly because you finally get that vital piece of plot that explains what was going on in the first two games
if youve never played the first two halflife games halflife opposing force id recommend playing them first as this game wont make a lot of sense without a knowledge of the events that occur in themif however youve played them before and are holding off on this game because of all the negative reviews id say just get it
the price has dropped and its certainly worth buying
buy it for the hidef pack if for nothing else youll get into the game if you tryi had to have this game
the graphics are slightly improved and the story is pretty cool but it was definitley too short and no where near as challenging as its predecessors
i would probably give this closer to   stars but because it was part of halflife which i believe is the fps ever i got it
reliving some of the things that happened in the previous games was great and brought back good feelings but it all ended too quickly
still the cut scenes and the story carried this one through
if the price would drop this woudl be a no brainerin this expansion to half life you control a security guard for the black mesa research facility named barney calhoun who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
basically you had just punched in for work when all hell breaks loose  by this i mean aliens are teleporting into black mesa and killing off everything in site and soon us marines as well as black op forces enter the scene looking to kill you and the civilians as well
its up to you to find a scientist named dr rosenburg and help him repair a miniteleporter so you can escapeif youve played half life or its other expansion pack entitled opposing force then you know what to expect in this game lots of puzzles and lots of action
you run around as barney looking through his eyes as he clutches his weapons tights and fights his way through black mesa
youll gather weapons like pistols magnums shotguns assault rifles grenades rocket launchers a crowbar and others
all these will be used to fight off dog like things that send out shockwaves vortigaunts tad pole like monsters that spit acid or whatever at you and us marines that were sent in to kill any living creature within black mesathe difficulty is a little hard and the puzzles are a bit tricky
for example to kill a us marine otherwise known as hecu soldier it takes like  shotgun blasts or  magnum shots or the puzzle where you have to complete an electric circuit but the game does nothing to tell you how to solve it and you only find out by accidently moving a barrel in between the wires and the charge goes through the barrelthe ending of the game was kind of lackluster but certainly better then opposing force
youre helping dr rosenburg and his colleauges finish charging this miniteleporter
as you wait for the thing to charge so you may flip the switch and open the portal to leave hecu soldiers come barging in
you fight them open the portal and run through
you appear outside with the scientists who note that something is wrong  your glowing green
quickly you teleport back to xen the alien homeworld
then you appear back outside where you hear rosenburg trying to figure out whats going on
just as quickly you appear in some sort of room and oyu see two hecu soldiers dragging an unconsious gordon freeman the protagonist from half life and saying things like we should just kill him now
and so on
then you teleport back outside and dr rosenburg notes that your no longer growing green that the scientists couldnt have done it without you and all of you go driving off away from black mesathe only real downfall i have is the lack of action fire fights andhow short the game was
it was incredibly shortnot on the same level as halflife but realistically what is
but a worthy entry in the halflife universehalflife was brilliant
it revolutionized the first person shooter provided hours of entertainment introduced us to a world of weapons and bizarre creatures and most importantly it unlike most video games stayed with its plot throughout the game
then opposing force came along a mission pack that was a game in and of itself the player now switching sides and playing through the military one of the enemies in the original halflife
although less plotdriven than the original its cheif weakness it still managed to create a very good gaming atmosphere even if it didnt quite match up with the first
then blue shift came alongi although a huge fan of the first two was apprehensive i felt sierra was trying to capitalize upon the success of the first two and running out of ideas was stretching things thin by having the player play as a security guardbarney calhoun
i was mistaken the game is faithful to the first with none of the weapons from op but most from the original and adds in some new thingspeople locations plotlines
it was most enjoyable to navigate barney calhoun through the waterworks and train depots of the black mesa compound and the ending was significantly different than that of the first twoi was very impressed by its simplicity and practicality
the game takes everything that was good about the original and compresses it into a smaller package but also adds several new sights and locations that lend much to the backstory of halflife and show even more of the breadth of the black mesa compound things that i appreciated very muchalthough rather short with no new weapons or aliens i highly recommend this mission pack to the halflife devotee or someone new to this family of gamesthe only reason why i give it four stars is because of the length
i see absolutely nothing wrong with this game except the length
most people would hate it because its short
but they obviously dont see that opposing force is included and an hd pack which enhances the weapons and the characters
plus the levels and voice acting are top notch
i found it rather interesting when the gman just ignores you near the beginning of the game
judging by what i wrote why give this game four stars when it could have gotten five
ill say it again the lengthwhen i bought blue shift i was really happy
i installed and began to play
the game was really good except for the fact that its  the length of half life and you hardly get any contact with other people besides the army
i would recomend that you buy this game but if you dont own the original half life buy that firstblue shift takes the player back to the lambda complex and retells the story of halflife through the eyes of one of the security guards in the research facilityi highly recommend that you play halflife and the opposing force expansion pack before you pick this one upthis was another fun expansion pack to play but i wish this game lasted  longer compared to the last expansion but if you want to enhance the graphics on both half iife  and half life opposing force  i recommend you get it and it is really fair priced now days
it makes the enemy models more detailed and the gun models kind of different because it changed the glock looking pistol to a beretta type looking pistol and the shotgun looks like a spas and the mp has been changed to a assault rifle but it still uses pistol ammo somehow lol
but the character model changes are a improvement believe me unless if you are going to play black mesa which is basically half life  remake with half life  graphicsokay i played the single player game with barney in five hours straight
was it worth 
yea just to get another fix of halflife
it was predictable not very challenging and the high definition graphics were no big deal
but i love the game
should you buy it
if you cant get enough halflife than its worth it
if the game is getting old for youmove on and spend you bucks elsewhereanother great entry for half life as the security guard
but this game was short and i beat it in  daysi have never beaten a game in  days
still very good just not very longthe first thing to mention is that final fantasy adventure is really part of the mana series secret of mana legend of mana
this is i believe the first game in the series with the sequel being the excellent secret of mana for the snes
i suspect that the reason for the name change is simply that square thought that the final fantasy name would sell more copies when released in america
this is an adventure rpgfinal fantasy adventure is similar to a zelda game in that you control a character from the top down and wander around whacking enemies with your weapon you get different weapons throughout the game
you must get clues to find where the next place to go is and what the next piece of the storyline is
it is as simple as finding and rescuing the princess but is deeper than that with side story and the mana tree
like other mana games you do end up at the tree of mana after a long adventure
when i first played this for the gameboy i was about  years old or so and i loved it
this game was a lot of fun and exploring that world was at times a small challenge but overall was just a blast
it really isnt part of the final fantasy series though you will see chocobos but this is worth playing for fans of the mana series as well as any who like old school gamesi have really enjoyed playing a series beginnings and this game is no exception
i first thought years ago that this was a final fantasy game but instead it is a mana game like secret of mana
i remember playing this game and really liking it
it has a story and the graphics are not so sparse that you do not have to pretend the blue is water and the green is land but rather when you go onto land there is texture like trees drawn and a cave opening
if you need color graphics then this and other games of this age will not be your cup of tea
i on the other hand had a great time playing iti cant tell you how much i loved this game when i first played it years ago
the gameplay is addictive the storyline is engaging the puzzles and battles are moderately challenging and the graphics are not so old that they are offputting
this is a traditional maidenindistress adventure story with swords and magic and was originally part of the mana series billed in the us as final fantasy to boost sales
a guide or faq may be useful to make sure you get all the secrets but the game should not take anyone too long to beat
it does not meet the high standards of graphics sound and story that gba games like golden sun are setting but for nostalgic quotold schoolquot gameplay this game cant be beat
buy it if you can find it and play the hell out of itfinal fantasy has quite a few games and a couple of little series spun off the main franchise such as final fantasy tactics and legend is another one
its unique in that you can customize your party and powerups work differently
personally i say that if youre starting out you want  humans one male one female and a mutant i chose male along with one monster
mutants level up on their own but you can buy stats for your humans and you can change your monster by feeding it the meat of other monsters so its a different way of playing the game but funthis game is a little short  you can finish it within one day or a total of  hours spread out however long even with working on leveling up but for a game boy game and the debut of one of the final fantasy miniseries this was actually a pretty decent game as a debut and laid out the groundwork for the rest of the seriesthe first final fantasy legend game was rather simplistic compared to the next installments but it did set the tone for the rest of the series
ff legend  improved on the first game tweaking out improvements and a more coherent storyline but with many of the same features limited use of weapons and spells for examplefinal fantasy  improved the series further with a more compelling storyline and the old limitation on weapons and magic were removed making for unlimited use of these
this was a definite boon as i wasnt too appreciative of having to buy weapons and magic after their uses ran out
ffl  and  focused on exploring different worlds moving higher and higher but this game took a different turn
there really are just two worlds
the first one is played in three different modes past present and future and you can travel between the three freely fulfilling various mission requirements before moving on to the second world pureland and eliminating the threat that would eventually destroy the first
out of the three ffl games this one is the best though the second one was still pretty good tooanother different feature of this game is that you cant choose your party members like you could in the previous two games
you get two humans and two mutants one male and one female of each but you could change them by eating the meat of monsters and if you wanted to change them back to original form you could with a feature you eventually gain later in the gamei remember really enjoying this game
the graphics are remarkably more in detail then the previous legend games
roleplaying games have something in common which is you need a pen and paper to write down stuff people say to you
i dont remember writing a lot but you see a cave you cannot get to yet then you would want to write down the grid the number of squares across and down
therefore if you do that then you will not have to worry about it so much
i remember walking around sometimes going where do i go but here again if you look back at what people have said to you then you will be pointed in the right direction
i liked the game for me the frustration level was rare
if you like older games then this will be a fun one for youfinally a new look to an absolutely hilarious classic
buy the nes version if youve got the chance
youll be rolling on the floor i guarentee itthis was actually the title that made me buy the gba
the original nes version of this game is an alltime favorite of mine and the idea of carrying around the game in my pocket was just too coolso what has changed
the biggest change is the new anime feel of the characters
this is the biggest disappointment the originals were appealing in their own way and the anime look for the most part makes all the teams genericthe important things are the same however
same gameplay
same cool power throws and more
same little angel version of character once they dieif you enjoyed the simple joy of launching a ball into the face of your opponents and watching them fly off the screen then this is a must buybought it played it beat it when i first played this game i beat tournament without losing oncethen i realized you can raise the difficulty level and then it became fun lots of different types of super throws
this game is a great improvement from the nes version if youve played the original you know what im talking about
just a fun game only not many modes of play
this got a  because it didnt included bean ball mode that was in the original bean ball mode is where you pick a character a go in a fun free for all arena with a friend and computers otherwise a must buyi am one of those diehard fans of the original game on the original nes
needless to say then when i saw a new improved version i was more than happy to see it on a portable platform
unfortunately i was a lot younger when the original came out and i found one notable flaw one player mode gets pretty boring
that said if you have  players and a link cable this cart is a must buythe basic premise is this two teams square off in a tenniscourt shaped thingy with  players from your team on your side of the court and  others waiting in the wings on your opponents side waiting for the ball to go out of bounds or to have a closer throw
your opponent gets the same setupwhen the whistle blows prepare for some elementary schoolstyle chaos
when you have the ball you throw towards your opponent trying to pelt himher in the head
if you score a successful hit a certain number of hit points are taken away from the receiver of said smack
if you are good or if you read the instruction book p you will discover how to do super throws which create some funny effects on the ball and lop off a good chunk of your targets hit points in the process
if the opponents hit points are drained to zero the player is out
get all  players on the opposing side of the court out and you win the match
never mind those other guys standing out of boundsbut beware your opponents objectives are the same as yoursi would recommend this game for anyone looking for a different spin on the sports genre
its reliving the fun and the pain of dodge ball days all over againhaving played this when it was in the arcades more than  years ago i had high expectations for this game
having played this gameboy version its nearly as much fun as the original and mostly authenticthe only negative comment i have is that its a little too easythis game is very fun and easy but after you win the special cup and unlock all the teams it gets kinda boring dont get me wrong this game is awesome and also very addictingearthworm jim is another classic game that has graced the gameboy advance
this game stays true to the original formula with tehe addition of an extra level and minigames
the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is ongoing as the levels are zany and well designed
if you want a fun game for you gameboy advance then this is the game for youpitfall the mayan adventure was good as a pc version and now with its arrival on gba its even better with sharper picture clearer sound and impressive quality
the aim is to take harry jr through the mayan jungles forests mines temples and tooms to find treasures avoid crocodiles tigers and other such nasties and basically try to stay alive
its a bit too difficult on some levels yaxchilan lagoon and toom of palenque but overall its good fun with some added surprises and goodnatured action
kill those monkeys
ha ha ha hathe original pitfall the mayan adventure was released almost  years ago for the genesis and super nintendo and i loved playing it on my genesis i played it constantly
when i heard it was being released on the gba i snatched it up and it gives me a nostalgic feeling when i play it now
however all of the problems that plagued the original are present here the tediously designed levels and somewhat uninspired gameplay but the good outweighs the bad
the graphics look better than ever the animation and control is super smooth and the backgrounds are nicely detailed
all in all this new version of an old classic is a pretty good addition to your gba libraryit is very cool that someone finally found a way to make a fighter pilot game
it has very good graphics considering the system
it is a little hard to see the enemy aircraft sometimes but the map lets you know where they are
it is very hard in the beginnign when you are masturing the flight controls because while you are trying to do that there are about a billion missils on your tail
the constant beeping to let you know that there is a missil on your tail is anoying because you always have a missil behing you
even with this is still suggest that you buy this gamewho ever gave this  video game  star probably doesnt remember that they only spent a little on this game
and for a little gameits pretty good
its a pretty simple concept with some strategy added on the side
the battles are short the blitzs are short and the tournaments are short
there is no actual end to the gamewhich in this case is sort of a good thing
just mindless fun
and heytheres multiplayer
what more could you ask from one of the cheapest video games ever made for gameboy
i should warn you thoughdont be fooled by those cute little characters on the box
this is definitely not a game for little kidsnot because of violence or anythingjust the whole concept if probably a little out of their range
recommended for people with no money or are being introduced to the gameboy advance controlskrazy racers does a good job at getting the mario kart concept down and is probably the next best thing to mario kart super circuit which comes out on august  krazy racers has chracters you probably never heard of
dracula from castlevanianinja from metal gear and goemon are probably the only chracters youve heard of but thats the only downfall really
of course im still getting mario kart but krazy racers has colorful trackscool musicpowerful items and it has a rumorboard which gives out encouragement and tips and it has a couple minigames
anyway if your bored with the current gba games and are waiting for mario kart try out konami krazy racers so you wont be bored on the wait for mario kartthere are so many games out there that it is hard to find a game that breaks the traditional mold of its genre
from the many street fighter spinoffs to the mario kart mascot racing one could say if youve played one youve played them all
not true
konomi krazy racers adds a few spices to the standard reciperacing begins just like every other mascot racer
you sit on the track  waiting for some franchised symbol to tell you when to go
since konomi does not have a major mascot you will not recognize any of the surroundings or characters
the racing engine is similar to wacky wheels pc  
as you zoom around the track you pick up  offensive weaponry
this consists of ice crystals bombs and rockets
you race around the track in a predetermined number of laps usually   this is pretty much the standardkrazy racers does mix things up by added a store where you can purchase weapons and kart upgrades prior to the race
there are also two new battle games
the first one is bomb chaser
bomb chaser reminds me of playing tag as a child
you zoom around in your kart until you crash  into someone causing the bomb you are carrying to explode
once you crash into someone you no longer carry the bomb and that person is essentially it
the other battle game is chicken
this is your basic chickie run as you zoom toward the edge of a cliff dock or whatever the stage theme is
the closer you are to the edge without going over the better your chance of winningthere really is not much to tell about the environment in this game
you have your standard kart themes open air prairie big lake if you have played super mario kart you already know the type
i was impressed by the reflection of the sky on the water
this is the first time that i have seen this done in any kart racer
it is a good attention to detaili can not complain about the game play on konami krazy racers
control fits the standard jump accelerator brake and item
this is an easy to learn racer because it does not require you to learn to jump and turn but jump is placed there simply for a defensive tactic
you can also use the jump for advance racing but the games formula does not require thisaltogether i am pleased to see a change in kart racing
i highly recommend this game to gamers of all ages
i would go as far as to say minus the battle mode featured in super mario super circuit this is a better gamefinally classic castlevania has returned to a nintendo system
the closest thing sadly enough that came close to a great n based vania game was belmonts revenge for the original gameboy
after that game a bunch of d games for the n that were pretty uncool
now though circle of the moon proves to be not only a nice throwback to the classics but step to the future as welli have heard that circle of the moon is closest to symphony of the night in regards to gameplay
ive never played sotn but i can say that circle is much like metroid was
you control whipweilding nathan not a belmont
as he quests through draculas castle in search of his lost master and to stop the evil of the dark vampire for good
rather than linear levelbylevel play you search the open ended castle much like the world in metroid going where you want and stopping at conveniant save points
of course some paths will be blocked until certain items are found thereby rewarding explorationits a great game
konami has thrown in many new tricks with the use of the magic items which gives you certain abilities and the card system which offers new weapons and powers
circle also has a rpg feel to it thanks to armorweapon powerups and character level upgrades
if you loved the old simons quest on the nes this will be right up your alley
unfortunately the graphics are far too dark to see much
it doesnt hamper gameplay but i found myself having to squint far too muchan awesome game and as a castlevania fan i am happy to say dracs backcastlevania circle of the moon was a launch title for the game boy advance back in  its been a few years since a d castlevania game was released to the public and they were hyped to hear it was coming to the gba
while it made an impact this game brought mixed results that fortunately was more good than badcastlevania circle of the moon follows a new main character named nathan graves on his quest to defeat count dracula in a brand new castle
much like every castlevania game so far you control the main character and he is armed with a whip
you can pick up weapons along the way to use against the enemies and bosses
a new feature was introduced to this game the card attribute system
you can find and acquire different kinds of action and attribute cards
when you combine certain cards together you unlock special effects that enhance your whip or weapons to deal greater damage
this comes in handy as the game gets harder
the castle you explore is huge but not every area is accessible from the get go
be ready to backtrack often because the items you need to help you progress further into the castle requires you to visit areas you cant get into before
when you need to take a break or want to continue your game later look for save rooms located throughout the castle to save your progress anytimethe pros its a brand new d castlevania game since symphony of the night and circle of the moon is a fun game to play
it continues with the new metroidvania game play style established by the pssaturn title so exploring the castle takes awhile and is entertaining as well
the controls and sounds are excellent and are perfect for highlighting what the gba was capable of doing early on in its debut to the world
the new card attribute system works well and is fun to mix and match cards to see what effects you activate there are so many that it will keep you busy trying to find them all as some are rare and others appear more often
this game is also challenging so at some points it will get hard but not to the point that you want to give upthe cons this game is darkliterally speaking
konami went out of their way to set the mood here to make this castle you explore spooky by making every area dark it worked too well because it is hard to see where you are going because of the lighting
and when your eyes adjust to it youll realize that the graphics arent that great
they are decent but not what you expect from a castlevania game
because of the graphics the animation is also lacking
while it doesnt ruin the experience you cant help to notice how they somewhat dropped the ball in these two areascastlevania circle of the moon made an excellent debut on the gba and was worth picking up as one of the launch titles for the new handheld system back then
despite its shortcomings it a fun game that carries on the tradition that is associated with a castlevania title
its hard to find nowadays and it very expensive to buy it new so you are better off getting it used
if you like action adventure games andor youre a fan of the series this game is worth investing your time innot straying too far from the castlevania mechanics circle of the moon is an excellent first for gameboy advancelet me start by saying i am personally not a castlevania fan
i was dubious as to the value of this title
the story starts like all the other castlevanias dracula the prince of darkness is unleashed in the world
this time you must stop the order of chaos from restoring him to his full strength
again you are armed with the preverbal whiplevel progression is what caught my attention
the levels are more like metroid baring  save points in key locations within a nonlinear progression
as you progress you fight several types of enemies ranging from the ever popular zombie to earth gargoyles who cause the earth to spike upward as an attack
to add a bit of a role playing element for every enemy you kill you gain experience points
these points allow you to level and grow stronger
you can also gain equip able items that strengthen your abilities and can double the ep
earned in combatfrom a control standpoint the mechanics remain the same
a jumps b whips
the shoulder buttons are used for throwing daggers and special abilities
this works nicely when performing precise movements
i was surprised to see the addition of a slide attack
i have found this to be quite useful in killing small enemies and plowing through zombies
though the game lacks a diagonal whip ability it forces your to time your jumps better
despite the rest of the controls i was disappointed with the whipping delay
to whip an opponent takes a full second
this is because they animated the draw back and forward lash
this is annoying when trying to hit enemies while jumpingi would also like to points out the exceptional usage of the gbas graphics capabilities
yes the character sprites are terrible like most other gba games but the backgrounds each have a unique feel
the save points are marked with a giant ring with a red sphere in the middle
accessing these causes the s rings to spin which was a nice touchoverall i highly recommend adding circle of the moon to your collection
take it from a nonbeliever this game is that goodtwo things i hate with the castlevania series its refusal to allow a multidirectional whip like they did in part  and when you have a lead character that does not have the last name of belmont or tepes alucard
usually when you have a whip tottin character without the belmont name the game is bound to not live up to cv expectations but then again the castlevania series needs to be revitalized and desperately
the gameplay has gotten stale over the years and thier venture into d didnt work so well not because it cant be done just because it could have been a lot better
symphony of the night for playstation was that revolution and i got it late because i had my n well before i bought a ps and so i didnt find out about sotn until much later
the formula combines the traditional cv atmosphere with gameplay elements of super metroid and it worked beautifully
the same can almost be said of circle of the moon but cotm is not without its flawsi had hoped that the tunes would be better dont get me wrong theyre great but i was expecting more and was dissapointed when i booted the game up only to hear midi music
i got spoiled by the orchistrated soundtrack of sotn and i realize there are probably some technical limitations here to consider
i had also hoped that there would be voice acting
i know that gba isnt exactly loud but come onthe real problem is that the super metroid style castlevania could get old fast
its not that this isnt a good game its great but im worried that this will become a stagnate formula to these games
konami needs to bring castlevania back into the d realm but do it right this time it can be done
this game isnt the game revolution that its predassessor was but it is still a lot of fun
now that the price has been slashed if you havent picked this one up yet do it
lets just hope that konami realizes that revolution is necissary to keep the games selling
this gameplay style could get stagnate
it isnt yet but i think they could only get away with this gameplay style one more time before they need to completely revamp the styleill skip the usual rambling
the game it first does seem dull because of how slow nathan walks and the snakes on the ceiling are a pain in the ass to get past without getting poisoned
but once you get the dash powerup and a few of the weapon cards the game starts to balance out into a decent game
the card setup within the game seems interesting but doesnt really belong
at this point i will say that the game overall was made for the castlevania fans and just about them alone the average castlevania follower has to have some patience due to the amount of enemies attacking you and waiting for a chance to get through
most people with a good amount of time on their hands and an sp will probably be able to deal with its issues but i dont recommend the game to the people with the original gameboy advancethe graphics are too darkbut with the light from the sp the picture looks good and the darkness sets a mood wellfirst of all yes this game is infamous for its darkerthananyothergba graphics
it is probably highly recommended that you play this game on a backlit gba the gameboy player or the ds
this is why i gave it the overall  star ratingnow for the actual game itself
after the great but overlooked symphony of the night due to the fact that sony and everybody else which is the audience wanting d games known for its gameplay and amazing d graphics fans wanted more so when the gba launched a month later this game came out
some think that this game wasnt as good as symphony of the night
well even though their mostly right but people have to remember that this was a game that was meant for a handheld so of course its not as pretty as that game
the gameplay is just like symphony of the night except there are a few differences
graphics are good but a bit choppy your whip is the only weapon you can use the card system is great and has a lot of experimenting the replay value is good the game is not quite as large as the other one there were  castles in the psone game the gameplay is more of as soon as you defeat this boss this is the next area to go to unlike symphony of the night in which you can have multiple paths to go make your own decision on where to go but still not every place you can go quite yet the exp system is actually better in sotn whenever you fight enemies for a long time they go from whatever exp points they have to simply  exp so your maximum level to get to is  to be exact but this game doesnt have that so you can go to level  in this game
because this is the rarest of the  gba game the other  were rereleased in a  in  cart
 some people might make their price higher than  bucks so get it while you can
this game is better than harmony of dissonance but not as good as aria of sorrow or the other nongba rpg castlevania gamesthe reason for my title is fairly simple quotcircle of the moonquot successfully pulled the castlevania series out of a dry spell that gave us the mediocre quotlegendsquot and n offeringsthe premise of the game pretty much remains unchanged with some new characters thrown into the mold basically draculas dark consort camilla decides to kick things off a little early this century by resurrecting dracula in the year   surprisingly youre not a belmont in this game you play as a character named nathan graves
as nathan youll explore draculas huge castle and collect dss cards these cards when combined with each other lead to an absolutly incredible number of special attacks
nathan will also learn special moves from defeating boss enemies such as the slide kick the high jump and the ability to break through stone blocksquotcircle of the moonquot is the hardest castlevania game since quotbloodlinesquot with healthrestore items few and far between and with a suspicious lack of any merchants nathan is going to have his work cut out for himone other gripe about the game its incredibly dark
as in you need direct overhead light to see what youre doing
i suggest playing this on an sp which has a back light or on a game boy player for the gamecubeps has finally put out a basketball game worth playing
before i had to pull out the dreamcast for the best nba action on a console with the nbak
if your a fan of hangtime or nba jam then this is the game for you
allen iverson type cross overs nys rucker park type street action enough trash talk for all  playing street players and it carries all nba teams with their top  best players and nothe lakers arent the best squad on the game
no fouls no calls just laceem up and bring on your quotaquot game
take your best game along with micheal jordan mike is back into the street mode to beat the best nbastreet teams and receive one of their players to add to your team or receive player points to create your own street super star
what trip me out the most was seeing the female pop group quotlwquot on the court making my game look real weak
the st night this game hit my home  friends came over and stayed up until am perfecting their cross overs skills and killer triple alley oop dunks
  insured the long stay the only problem i have with the game is the announcer
he sounds like a brotha from deep counrty mississippi who moved to ny and picked up some hiphop slang
quotblingblingquot they couldve left that phrase out
great game sure to keep yours thumbs sore from hours of playonethis isnt is good as the nd one but it is a good game
you could unlock street legends like stretch takashi and bonifidein the season mode when you beat a team you can take a player from their team
it has courts like rucker park and many more
i would get this game if i was youits not your traditional  on  bball simulation
its got flare and style straight from the street
ever see the and mixed tape videos
well this game captures the flashy crossovers the insane dunks in an nba jam type format but better
gameplay is easy enough to grasp as anyone can pick up the control and start playing
you pick your main team and travel to courts throughout the world challenging other nba and street legends
once you beat a team you can add some of there players to your team building your own dreamteam
though it may seem like a run and gun type game you will have to play d if you want to get far
the gamebreaker shot is a nice addition to the game as this shot keeps you in the game or breaks it wide open its all about timing
only complaint is it is not multiplayer other than that it is the best bball game on pslets face it nba live  was horrible and everyother hoops title was worse
nbastreet is a somewhat original title similar to nba jampros gameplay more than just pressing the shoot button
you need to learn special dribbling and dunk moves to make combos to earn style points sorta like a fighting gamegraphics  good for a hoops game but dont begin to show off th e pss capabilityits funcons speed its not a dvd rom so it takes long to load the games and the memory card saves inbetween everygame which takes about  minutesfeels like difficulty its too easy even on the hard settingcommentaing the announcer is a bad  of black people who repeatedly spews the same slang phrases after every basketreplay value there is nonerosters sadly there were some trades in the offseason and some free agents left to get even more millions of dollars so some rosters are incorrect
it doesnt really affect gameplay thoughoverall i bought this game along with resident evilcvx and twisted metal black  resident evil bored me to death  twisted metal frustrated me to death and nba street was just rightnba street has to be one of the most fun games ive played in quite some timeplaying much like a distant cousin of the old nba jam series nba street offers lots of overthetop playmaking in your face trashtalking and mindboggling moves
it is downright fun and contagious
one word this games entertainment value is much greater when played against another opponentessentially you get a team made up of  players from the nba team of your choice and you go from city to city taking on the best street players the city has to offer on some of the grittiest baddest street courts youve ever seen
you accumulate points by making trick moves which take some time to master
the more points you garner the more ability you gather until you can pull a quotgamebreakerquot shot which gives you points while taking points away from your opponentthere are some graphical glitches every now and then
for example i had one guys arm simply pass right through another guys head
but those are few and far between and do not detract from the overall enjoyment i hada word of warning this is not a simulation
its a basketball charicature on steroids
so if youre looking for stats and reallife basketball this game is not for you
but if you can stand a break from reality and need a game of good oldfashioned street ball this is the game you wanti went to the store in the morning got it and played it for  and a half hours and i beat it
this game sure is fun and you get micheal jordan witch was very cool but at the last level you loose him and have to play against himthis game has very easy controls but i didnt like the thing that takes away your points awaybut overall its a very good game for children the controlls are the same as any other nba game the graphics are great and you can get some really amazing
dont buy it because once you beat it you wont want to play it again so rent it beat it and thats itthis game is a great update to the nba jam style of arcade basketball
i enjoyed that i was not as ridiculously wild as nba jam which had crazy dunks and silly moves
nba street has some great moves lots of options and plenty of your favorite players
i wish the ai was a bit stronger as i found i could roll through most anyone with the right team but all the stat keeping was worth the trip
i even built a great player which gave me control over his skills
definately a worhwhile purchase if you like  on  street balllace up the tops and hoop it up quotbig stylequot
be a blacktop baller in ea sports big nba street the first fastpaced inyourface on basketball video game
crown yourself king of the hardcourts as you showoff your roundball skills
rain from the outside or school your opponent on the inside as you take it hard to the post and slam it home with authority
with quotoffthebackboardquot passes and dizzying quotcrossoverquot dribbles nba street is streetball at its best
stop  pop  dropcount it
if you dont have game then step off the courtthis game is great to any fan of nba jam looking for something new and freash ea big sports delever the goodplaya
the one player game does get repeitive but the multiplayer is something you could play endlesslythis is proably one of the best basketball games for the ps
even though it is not all that realistic like shaq shooting a three and making it
other than that this game is really good you can play two player or one player against the old school team
i would recomend this game to anyone who wants to play a fun gamebasicaly it can be only described as fast paced arcade basketball action
definately something i want to see more of in the near future
its worth the price its going for now so check it out if you like basketball gamesthis is a awesome basketball game but is extremely unrealistic thats why i love it
if you were a fan of nba jam way back when then youll love this gamegrapihcs smooth textures and d background peoplesound
okay the swooshes and the main characters talking are awesome but the anouncer is unforgivablereplay
its basketball play it againoverall fun 
with great gameplay that allows you to do sweet unrealistic dunks and controls that are a little different but great this game is definitely worth the moneyfinally the advance gameboy is here and the first wrestler available is firepro
i have heard much about the series of wreslting titles and i must say this is a good wrestling game
with a gameplay style a tad different than fighting games i am used to firepro is a title that rewards timing and patience
it comes with many wrestlers and has an extremely indepth createawrestler function
styles range from typical american pro wrestler to ultimate fighting style so the type of character you make can have quite a rangeon the downside the game has no championship mode where the player would play a quotstorylinequot mode
this seriously hampers replay value as players are left to fight oneonone matches without any serious reward
also unlike some of the other released games where you could have  players play off of one cartridge firepro demans that each player have a seperate cartridge as wellall in all a good start for the advance
a good solid wrestler that will have you learning the ins and outs for a whilethis is a great wrestling game
the best for the gba next to the second version
you have to rename all of the wrestlers you know
this is to protect the copyright issues
a few of the hints to rename athe nicknames chosen bthe names chosen and c the finishers chosento unlock the hidden wresters you must go to the edit menuselect edit superstargo to name entryon the first line type allon the line below it type stylesand on the line next to that type clearthis should unlock all the hidden wrestlersi used this thing on playstation  ten years agoalthough i prefer my keyboard and actually playing music  this thing pufs out decent quality sounds by todays standardsits decent quality music making on a budget for psprobobly the best you can get for that particular systemi gave it a four out of five because its dated but the essential tools you need are all herepercussion bass pianos guitarsetcits flippin coolif you own a gamecube i hope you enjoy the ergonomic design of the controllers as much as i do
when nintendo announced it was releasing a first party wireless controller i was very excited
this controller doesnt disappoint with the same button and stick layouts as the wired firstparty controllersyou choose a frequency to use by rotating a numbered dial on both the controller and the receiver that plugs into the controller port on the cube which allows you to use up to  wavebirds at a time should an aggressive super smash bros melee match be in your futurethe controller also has an onoff switch which allows you to shut it off and save extra battery life which is a nice touch
i also appreciate the red light on the receiver which lights up when it receives the signal from the wavebird making it very easy to tell if you are in rangethe only complaint that i have is one that nintendo has addressed namely the lack of rumble functionality
to paraphrase nintendo to add the rumble feature would have greatly shortened the battery life of the controller
for many games the lack of rumble feature isnt an issue and the wavebird works perfectly
for those games that rumble is a major part of i just use an extension cable for my wired controllerhonestly ive always loved using these controllers since they are one of the best wireless technology back then highly recommend paying for used rather than paying more than how much they are actually worthwonderful solid product
its good on batteries but i think that might have a lot to do with the omission of rumble feedback
after playing with one for a year i bought morethe gamecubes firstparty wireless controller will not disappoint
at  hours of gameplay it has an unbeatable battery life even outstripping xbox  and ps controllers
the extra bulk is hardly noticeable and actually helps if you have large hands like mine
its only drawback is the lack of rumble feature which helps save battery life
if you dont mind not having rumble feature this controller is phenomenalprosno cord to trip overcan control games from a greater distanceeasier to store than regular wired controllerconsdoes not include a rumble feature which is actually okay with me as i find the rumble to be distracting but just to let you knowmay cause interference with other wireless devicessometimes reciever does not receive your signal thus disrupting gameplayoverall i find the wavebird wireless controller to be very convenient to use but sometimes i prefer the smoother game control of a regular wired controllerthis controller rox
i wish everything could go wireless like this
it works so well
no probs at all with connectivity
the only thing this is missing is the rumble feature  but i never really cared about that anyway
the real problem is how long it took me to buy this thing
ive had my gamecube for more than a year and always thought the wavebird was too bulky looking but it actually feels better than the normal controller
its great not being limited to  feet in front of the tv
and if you pause a game  no more cheating when you leave the room to do something because the controller can come with you
bravo nintendo
when the n hits package wireless controls with itif it had the rumble it would be perfect i bought the wavebrid wireless controller because the gamecube controller wires dont reach the couch in my livingroom
i was expecting a heavy and uncomfortable design
what i got was exactly the opposite
the wavebird is in fact lighter than the original gc controllers
despite the fact that the middle space is filled up with the receptor or something it still features the same ergonomic comfort and gameplay is not disturbed at all
the absense of the wire provides a somewhat more free game experience and it eliminates the frustrationg of wire knots and tangles and having the wire pop out in the middle of a game
the channel changer is easily moved which can sometimes mess you up although it is not that much of a problem for me
although it currently only comes in two colors im sure that like the other controllers they will come out with ones with different coloring
it does lack a rumble pack but this is a small price to pay for the convenience it provides
there is a big price to pay however 
the wavebird is double the price of the normal gc controller
because of this i recommend that you only purchase one at least until new colors are released or unless they go on sale and you just cant resist the thought of having two
the wavebird is really a great controller and despite the hefty price and lack of a rumble pack and color variety it is well worth itive been using this controller for a while with zero problemsand as long as i make sure i turn it off when im done the batteries last quite a whilethe only downsides as i see it is its a bit big and theres no rumblebut then a rumble pack would likely run the batteries down too quicklyif you know the gamecube controller you know what youre getting hereexcept wirelessa few years ago i found a stock of platinum ones at my local walmart
they were all on sale for  i have no idea how that happened
my guess was that they had found old stock in the backthis was around the time the wii was still hard to find and production of the wavebirds had long since ceased
you can imagine my joy when i found them while glancing through wallys worldbut i still wanted the other color just to complete my collectionist mentality so i ordered the gray onenow some time later i purchased the white gamecube controller for the wii from amazon
at  with free shipping it seemed and was a very good deal
yes they are directly imported from japan but theres no reason youd need to be concerned unless for some reason you need the box in english
theyre fine and i believe the only way to get them was by importing anywaythe benefit of these over the regular gamecube controller
the lengthier cordbut why choose cord when you can have a wireless wavebirdthe construction quality is the same but thats to be expected from anything by nintendo
the wb is slightly heavier in that the two aa batteries in the back of the controller make it weightier
they dont come with a builtin rechargeable battery but i prefer that as i get to use my enelooopsincluded in the packaging is a receiver which you plug into the gamecube controller port
its a little longer than necessary but i imagine thats to accommodate the antenna
there are wheels on the bottoms of both the controller and receiver and these click for each number from  at least i think the last number is 
just match the numbers from controller to the receiver and youre good to gowhen i purchased the gray controller used it didnt come with a receiver but the one included with my platinum worked with it just fine so long as they matched in numberdespite being wireless and despite how rare the wavebird may appear i actually prefer the regular white gamecube controller for three main reasons  comfort  no input latency  rumblewhile the wavebird and corded controllers are identical in form and size there is a little bit of extra plastic underneath the wavebird to allow for the batteries and wheel
while it may not bother some it actually hinders me from perfectly gripping the controller
my fingers dont wrap around the handles as well as the corded controller and my unused fingers actually cramp after a whileim a  male with smallerthanaverage hands if that helps you determine my hand sizei havent come across this but some have complained about games not receiving inputs correctly because the wb is wireless
its true that having cords and a direct plugin will always lead to higher input ratio than wireless but i havent had issues with my games not recognizing my button presses
still its something to note especially if youre playing certain games where every button press and stick maneuver is crucial like ssb or mario kartrumblei love it
i need my rumblemany consider it a gimmick
sony tried to denounce it as an excuse for not having it when the ps initially came with a sixaxis controller
but ive loved the rumble feature ever since the first dualshock came out
if i have the option of using a controller with rumble ill go for ittheres my review
if you can get a wavebird for a decent price and you need wireless id say go for it
but you can get the much superiorin my opinionwhite gamecube controller with extra cord length brand new for a less princely sumand now that nintendo announced theyll be reviving the gcn controller for ssb wii u those could be another better alternativedragon ball z budokai is a good fighter that every dragon ball z fan should own
the graphics are mediocre but the animations are fairly fluid
the sound will make you feel like your watching the cartoon good smacks and character yells are here
you get a good amount of characters to choose from though not all of them are here
gameplay is simple but fun there are practice modes tournement and story modes
overall this game is fun and will provide the casual gamer a good time but dragon ball z fans will be very pleasedthis is the only dragonball z game i have played so it is the best by far
it is a good game for fans of the show as well as people who arent as familiar with the material
for one thing it allows you to see the story progress all the way through the cell saga in a very short amount of time
it may not seem that way but if you have seen the show youll know what im talking about
its a good show but it can be i dont know a little slowpaced at times
but thats another subject altogetherthere are many different modes in this game the regular story mode the tournament mode which is where most of the replay value lies and the hercule mode which can be unlocked after winning the tournament on advanced mode i think
the best feature is the ability to collect capsules and customize your fighterthe actual fighting is pretty good although the characters seem to move a little slower than i would like
doing the special moves can be a problem as well
i would usually have to resort to using one move over and over again because thats the only one i could pull off
but that is a problem with a lot of fighting games
the big thing for me was being able to collect all seven dragonballs but the prize for doing this seems somewhat underwhelming
in the show the only thing the wishes ever get used for is bringing people back from the dead so what does someone wish for when no one has died
super strength
invincibility
nope the only thing you can wish for is a capsule that will let a character be able to use every special attack in battle
that is weak and lame especially since i just noted i can barely pull off half the combos
thanks for getting my hopes up for nothingother than that this game is worth the money especially now that its on sale
pick it updragonball z budokai in my honest opinion is the most polished game out of all the budokai console games
while i say that its the most polished game that doesnt mean it is the bestthat honor lies in budokai 
dimps went above and beyond their duties to give dragonball z fans a game that captures the look and feel of the series
fans get a chance to relive some of their favorite episodes in story mode and that in itself is why i say it is the most polished
theres  dbz characters to choose from seven modes to try familiar locations for fighters to fight inas well as unlockable goodies and more
the one important feature that i think makes this game shine is the skill edit feature
with the skill edit feature players can customize their characters their fighting techniques and their abilitiessuch as healing etc
serious fighting fans and advanced gamers will definitely get into that feature i assure youstory mode while grand in its presentation could have been alot longer that it was
as it stands though it was short and sweet  left me wanting morethis first game showed alot of promise and is a game that not only fighting game fans but dragonball z fans will have fun withi played this game with a friend who was a huge fan of dbz and i played the game
it sucked
its just like street fighter or some oter figthin game
the graphics suck too
you get to play most of the charcters from the show big whoop
rent this game fristas a fan of dbz buying this game was a nobrainer and when i started playing it was fun
the problem with the game is there are times where the game could have been better but it seems the developers cheaped out
the story mode follows the anime closely so theres no real surprise but it was admittedly nostalgic fighting certain characters like friezaoverall if youre a dbz fan youll enjoy the game but it does get boring after a couple of hours unfortunatelybased on the anime series dragonballz budokai is a fighter game that includes  dragon ball z warriors
features include turning super saiyan unlocking buying and trading skills
you can also collect  dragonballs and make a wish which gives you access to all the moves of one character
this can be done as many times as you can keep collecting the  dragonballsthere are several modes in this game
you can either enter the story mode which helps you unlock characters fight in a tournament or even battle against another friend
at first you are given access to the main characters such as goku vegeta and piccolo
however these few select characters at the beginning changes quickly as you are able to acquire others such as freeza cell hercule great saiyaman trunks captain ginyu antroid  android  android  android  dodoria raditz nappa and zarbon
however despite the amount of characters you can play as  there are no characters from the majin buu saga which would include goten and buu
there is also no android  which wouldve been another great characterbudokai is a highly recommended game whether you like dragonballz or are just looking for another  on  fighting game
this game also has d graphics which takes away from the actual look of what dragonballz really looks like but the graphics are still well doneproscolorful d graphics characters to choose fromstory modetons of skills to learnconscan be too complex to learn all the skillsgame doesnt follow through all the sagasother recommendations for great dragonballz fighter games isbudokai  for playstationeven more characters are involved including fat buu kid buu goten and all the fusions such as vegeto
android  is also included
if you have budokai you can trade capsules skills between budokai and budokai   this game is also cell shaded to look more like the anime seriesultimate battle  for playstationgreat dbz fighter gameteiketsu for gba another dbz fighter worth a lookthis game is the first of the dragonball z budokai series
it features all the characters from the saiyan saga to the cell games saga
you can also go through the story of dragonball z using the story mode this is also how you unlock most of the characters
the other two characters you have to get by beating the world tournament stagecons if you dont like fighting games this is not for you
if you dont want to keep pressing the same button combinations all the time id suggest one of the later games in the series
it only goes to the cell games saga
it leaves out the garlic jr saga just in case some of you were wonderingpros its based on the show so if youre a fan youll like it
if you have some of the other games or if you are thinking about getting one of them this is a good way to train yourself with the controls
this is the only game in which you get to play as either android  zarbon or dodoria in case you wanted to know if there are any secondary characters in the game this is the only game in which the characters arent cell shaded although in dragonball z budokai  they fixed up the job a littlefinally i will end this by saying that even though i only gave this four stars this game was extremely well made
again this game is also very good at training you with the controls of the other games so if you are having trouble check it outthis game is awsome way better than the big upset dragon ball z ultimate battle  and much better than dragon ball gt final bout
this game is great it even has super sayian  to unlock super sayian  beat the advance world tournament with everyone and beat the whole story mode after that play as goku and right before the battle press x ss goku should apppearthis is the ultimate dragonballz game out there
it has  different fighting modes so you can tear other fighters apartyou can customize your fighter to be the ultimate z warrior in the world using the skills system
there are  playable characters i have them all from the saiyan sagaraditz to the cell games and you have the legendary of hercules mode which lets you recreate the part about hercules beating cell instead of gohan
its pretty funny
you can use the spirit bomb big bang attack super kamehameha and destructo disk
the only  flaws are that the moves are the same for every player except their special moves like gokus warp kamehameha and there is no buu sagamaan
there is also the incredibly cool burst mode
im tellin ya man this game is off da hook son
even if ya dont like dbz its still an awesome fighting game
move over tekkenfinally after years of waiting a good dbz game is here
final bout was okay but this game is much better
the character selection is mostly everyone from the saiyan saga to the end of the cell saga
they even have the same voices from the tv show
now im not just giving this game  stars because i like dbz it earned themthere are quite a few modes of play
there is story mode where you follow basically the same story as the tv show
then you can go back and play it again to get more characters
there is duel mode which is just  on  there is also tournament mode where you compete for money
with the money you can buy capsules to customize the fighters moves
also you can unlock harder level tourneys so you will not get too bored
last but not least legend of hercule mode
this mode is unlocked once you beat the adept tournament and buy the capsule from mrpopo
it is probably the most fun mode because you compete in the cell games and there are handicaps
hercule always has something funny to say that just cracks me up
if you are a fan of hercule or hate him you will like this mode
truly this makes the game the best
playing with hercule is the most rewarding expeirience ever
his moves make him look so weak yet they are funny and do alot of damage in the end
but you are probably wondering about the fighting
the fighting is pretty basic
you can move forward and backward or sidestep to move left and right
but you cannot jump or crouch
the only way to fly is to get knocked into the air
still the moves look beautiful and are easy to master
when you transform into a super saiyan or power up you do more damage and your icon by your health changes
but theres one thing that you have to learn its how exactly to pull off moves
the move may say to do  kicks in a row but hitting the kick button  times will probably be sufficient
this is because hitting kick once may result in the character kicking  times
once you understand it and play duel a couple times you will start to love it and it will feel natural
the graphics are beautiful
everyone looks just like the cartoon but in d
also everyone moves so fluently and dont jerk around
so the fighting is topnotchthe only big flaw in this game is that it may get old
fighting over and over can get boring
and after doing story mode it is pointless to do it again
also no girl fighters are available so the females may feel left out
one more thing there are not enough tutorials to teach you how to do things
there are some in the story but not enough
i still do not know how to charge my ki and it took me forever to learn how to side step
otherwise feel free to buy this gamethis game is great
it incorporates every thing from the tv show with all the fighting of gt for the psx
of course its no deadly alliancedragon ball z budokai for the psii is probabaly the most faithful video game adaption for dbz that ive bothered to play
at first i was weary of this game because it was developede by artari who really didnt leave much of an impression on me with driver ps or the glitchtastic movie tiein enter the maxtrix
i figured they were gonna rush this game like they did with the aforementioned game and it was gonna turn out horriblyi would be left with a bad game i wasted my money on
but to my humble surprise this game is fantastic
youll be able to play up to  or more characters from the series villains and hero alike spanning from goku piccolo the sayains and dr geros greatest creation cell
the video game menus are done quiet nicely
it looks and feels like something from japan rather than the usthe game has practice story and tournament modes to choose from
the story mode is not at all impressive
they could have just inserted some animated cinematics from the actual dbz cartoon instead they give the player poorly animated d cut scenes that are somewhat like sequences from the episodes but not at all as impressive
a lot of work needed to be done in the animation department and it was simply overlookedthe tournament mode is probably the hardest level in the game of all
your opponents will knock you around like a rag doll which means your gonna have to spend a lot of time in the practice arena unless you wanna get beat down because of your lack of skill with a character
the ai
are sheerly brutal which is a dbz trademark when their not being stupid and allowing you to beat the crap out of themyou also need to learn a lot of combos and special moves if you are to survrive either the tournament or story mode because the further you go into the game the harder it gets regardless the short battlesall the characters retain their trademark moves like gokus kamehameha wave and kaioken attack piccolos spical beam cannon vegetas galick gun and freizas death beam
to make a long review short this game is great for diehard fans of dbz
however if your not a fan and dislike dbz dont bother giving the game a second glance
however if you are give this game a chance
youll enjoy it just dont expect too much out of it
 a  out of whadaya want
theres the new wendys homestyle chicken strips the big bacon classica frosty damn im making myself hungry
oh well
its after  pm anyway
it would be cool if this game had more blood but its violent enough to be rated t
i usually just play the story mode because its cool well some very little isnt fighting so thats why i only rated it  stars overall
its so much fun
thats the one ill say when i review mortal kombat deception
i am bloooodthirsty
this game has cursed me almost as much as mk deadly alliance did
i fell in love with that game as soon as i saw some blood and guess what
i delivered the blow
whahahahaahaahahhahahaha
okay
isense ive gone too far
however the story mode is reminding me of the tv series which ended the same as this game does and its easy but iiiiitttttssssfun to play on a rainy day
ha
my personal favorite guys to be are frieza and cell
i know
elses favorite is teen gohan
who gives a flying freak
the rest of the blood is on the fighters after theyve been injured so bad they can probably barely lift a pebble
the end of the game is a little different than that
the only character i dont have is hercule
what a doink
he cant do crap on the show and ive played him before on another memory card
he had to wear a friggin rocket pack
everyone else on this game can fly
what kind of dingdong has to wear a rocket pack when he swears he can beat cell with only a poke
he acts like it and everyone loves him for it
i loathe people like that
aaannnyyhoo it doesnt matter
if you like dragonball z and want to start off the game series play this firstoh man what am i blabbin about
this is the only ps game i have for the dragonball z series
i also have legacy of goku but its just not as funim one of the great old ones in american dbz fandom certainly online
i watched the entire series in the original japanese because there was no other way to do it back in the early days
i played all the early dbz videogames
it was exciting news to this yearold geek that dbz budoukai would be released hereoverall its a decent fighting game with some neat twists but its not quotall it could bequot
like some of its more recent ancestors its missing some of the features that the older games offered and doesnt really hand us much else to replace itgood points nice movement of the characters pretty backgrounds some really quite cool animations for major combat sequences the chance to do some apparent property damage though someday theyve got to actually make the scenery really take damage so you can make craters with the blasts and then end up fighting in them etc
decent storyarc intros and animations
a couple of very nice easter eggs how you get yamucha finally
as a playable character features a visual so stunningly hysterical that i lost the battle the first time because i was laughing too hard to defend myselfnegatives obligatory dubbed voices
cmon even the battle arena toshinden people caught on and offered players a choice between hearing bad english dubbed versions of the fighting characters and the original japanese ones
this should be a nobrainer with so much space to play with on a dvd give us a choice of the original or dubbed versionssimilarly terrible bgm
the original background music for dbz was one of the most effective soundtracks on tv
why they have insisted on dumping it even in the videogames for tired stupidsounding electric guitar riffs i have no ideaonce again the powerduels have been forgotten
in the  old snes dbz games you could have the classic sequences where vegita threw a big attack goku threw his own and the two tried to battle powertopower to see who won
the more recent entries have failed to do thatone player tournament only
cmon this is stupid
any offer of twoplayer options is a good idea it permits a game to be a social event rather than a oneperson wankfest
the old snes game and the playstation ultimate battle  offered many hours of combat entertainment for whole groups as we used to choose characters and play through budoukais together
this is a major mistakei dont like their combospecial move methodology
i much preferred the old method similar to that found in toshinden and other fighters where you combined the simple punchkickenergy button with a symbolic movement on the control pad
the quotchain of punch and kick etcquot approach doesnt quite do it for meso three stars as a flatout game one extra because its dbz and i like it
perhaps budoukai  will be betterthis game may not be as difficult as the others but it is still a great game to play
as the first in the dragon ball series for the ps this game is extreemly entertaining
my friend in i go headtohead nearly every day on this game in the sweet duel mode
and with the skills edit menue you cant custum any fighter to be the ultimate fighter by winning more and more tournaments in the tournament mode and winning zenii
this is another great gamedragon ball z boudoki is the th dbz gaem to hit america
for the most part the games are not bad however each title that they release is truley nothing spectacular
however for fans this title will not disapointthe focus on boudoki is on the combat
set in d type world the game takes off with some decent results
there are multiple modes to work with to include story mode world martial arts tournament duel and practice
each one is a little unique in its own way but the fighting stays the same
lets discuss each one individuallystory mode basically tells the tale of dbz up to the cell saga what not enough time to fit majin buu
the first time through you fight as goku primarily
the only other warrior you can control is gohan at later moments
however once beaten you unlock more chapters in story mode involving other characters
eventually by doing so you unlock more guys for other modes
teh only other upside is the ability to collect capsuls to customize your own characterduel is just as it states a vs mode
the battles are only one on one and it can be p vs cp p vs p or cp vs cpworld martial arts tournament is a little more unique in the way it is set up
you pick your guy and and difficulty level the other two must be unlocked and then compete to earn money
the ways to win this is to knock out your foe or knock them out of the ring
if you win you earn money to be used at mr popos housepractice  if i have to explain this than you must be at least  years oldthere are two other customary options but nothing spectacular
you have mr popo house which enables you to purchase capsuls to customize your own guy for duel practice and wmat and than customize enables you to do that
it is nothign spectacularoverall this game is fun for a fighting game but with shallow combat and difficult to pull off special moves this game is more for die hard dbz fans which is why i gave it  stars
if i was not a dbz fan than in all honestly i would of given it  or less when you compare it to other games such as virtua fighter  tekken  and mortal kombat deadly alliance
over all this is for fans only and nobody elsethe budokai series is the best
this game is on my top ten favorite games of all time
budokai rules
i can play the game for hours
story mode is good
the controls could use a little more work but overall they are okeither your a dragonball z fan or your not
if you are a fan you will buy this game and add it to your collection
if not you can still play it and have a good time
a spectacular d world filled with the fiercest fighters the universe has ever known
test your skills against the most powerful dragon ball z heroes and the most sinister villains
every battle is more intense more dangerous and more epic than the one before
will you be the last warrior standingthis game features follow the dragon ball z animated series from saiyan saga to cell gamesface off with up to  mighty dragon ball z warriorsunlock customize and trade devastating skills with friends to create the most powerful fighters in the universefight in five epic play modesfine tune your skills against custom ai opponentsbattle at blazing speeds in the burst zonebuy itthe goodgreat news for the millions of dbz fans finaly a good dbz fighting game
with a stunning aray of characters dbz budokai far surpasses its predecessors
from raditz to cell each character has there own special flare which keeps the game fun
not to mention the ability to customize every characters skills allows you to add your own personal touch to your favorite character
but as if that wasnt enough the battle system although alittle strange at first is so fast pace and well designed i would say that this would be one of the best designed battle types ever created for a fighting gamethe badthe major problem i saw with this game was the way they made earning custom skills and dragonballs completly random
theres nothing more annoying than listening to mister popo greeting you and saying good by  in an hour just because you cant find that last dragonball or that skill capsul you need to make your fighter perfect
lastly i did praise the battle type but i beleive it would have been a bit better if you could exicute some specials by doing a more convensional move like quater back circle or somethingsummarywell im a big dragon ball z fan and that probably made my thinking a bit biased and im sure if instead of dragon ball z characters they had original characters i wouldnt have even given this game a glance
but just because they have dbz characters is a good enough reason to make me want to buy this game so show you saiyan fighting spirit and have funi actually just got this game and i  must say im pretty impressed
i didnt know the gba could process graphics like this
veru colorful stylish and fun
dreamcast fans or people that cant really afford any of the bigger systems are gonna be very pleased with this title
the reason why i didnt give it  stars
sometimes the graphics get a little scrambled especially if theres too much action going on and the cars are not as fast as they should be
other than that great gamewhen i bought this game i thought it would look better than driver  advance and the ps version
it lookes the same
but it is fun to play if you like driving games
 stars because i like crazy taxi and missing one star because it is more easier to use it on the sp
also its by thq not segawhy
tip in normal rules get  dollars or more to unlock the second citythe gamecube is another excellent system from nintendo
unfortunately third party support for the system is somewhat lukewarm
luckily as usual nintendos first party games are instant classics and must play games for people of all agesprosawesome first party games metroid prime zelda the wind waker mario sunshine mario party  wario resident evil mario kart double dash
controller while confusing at first is pretty good
the wireless wavebird is awesomeawesome accesories game boy player wavebird gba to gamecube linkcompact designcomes in lots of cool colorsits only  dollars
 controller portsconsthird party support is waning although there are still some good rd party gamesnot the best for sports gamesregarded as quotkiddiequot by older gamers so you might not want to bring this to college although resident evil is available among many other mature gamescant play dvds or cds xbox and ps can play bothbasically no online games and nintendo is not making any online gamesthe game devolper rare who made donkey kong country and banjo kazooie was sold to microsoft so no more awesome rare games for gamecubeoverall the gamecubes excellent first party games and cheap price make it a solid buy for gamers
this system is excellent for any gamer
it brings you hours of classic nintendo fun for an economical price
if you are a fan of nintendo or dont have a lot of money to spend i highly recomend this systemthis is definite improvement from its predecessor the graphics were improved dramatically and the physics of the carthe only gripe i had was interest level same with the first i got bored after a few hours of gameplay it got too repetative and predictablethis was horribleit was borining there wasnt much funthe game may look fun but it isnt rent it firstgraphics arent goodno good game modesi had very high hopes for this game judging by the screenshots and movies
when i bough mcii i was pleased but a little disappointed
first of all there are three cities totalto race in paris la and tokyo
sounds fun right
right except that you have to work your  off to earn paris and tokyo
only la is available at first
what a bummer
another problem is the opponents you face and the challenges they give you
you are always the major underdog
its like the bulls vs the nuggets in the nba except now its in a video game with street racing
dont be surprised to find yourself trying race over and over again
on the other side the cars are pretty cool and the city graphics are very slick much better than even those in vice city rockstars other famous title
twoplayer is pretty nice but i find the lack of games modes to be a train wreck
this game is way better than the first mc but it is not the best racer on the ps
need for speed hot pursuit is
overall if you are a big fan of racing titles or big city environments then you may find midnight club ii worth your investment
once you gain access to paris and tokyo the game is awesome
especially in paris the landmarks are everywhere the graphics are some of the best in a racing game and the cities become an allout funfest to explore
you wont hardly want to race anymore
it is very openended much like gta vice city
my ratingthis game by rockstargrand theft auto state of emergency is the sequel to a game i hear about mabye  times
when midnight club  was around im pretty sure thats when burnout came on the scene and burnout looked spectacularly better
however this game is extremely fun and yet frustratingyou street race
there is an incredible likeness to the fast and the furious
you can do nitro which basically looks like fast and furious and feels pretty cool too as you watch the scenery speed by you
you street race by picking cars to race with
i do not know the difficulty of any of the cars so when you start up a series of raceswith saves in between you honestly dont know what your getting into
i did this race with this guy called victor on the first area and was sorely beaten but eventually found a way to knock him off his high horse for his car
it can be frustrating doing a race several times just to memorize the map
you usually dont have time to look at your map and stay focused so you will probably play a mission about  times until you get the hang of it
then there are stupid mistakes that you do and the ai wont do
like miss a turn which screws you out of the checkpoint which will make you lose the race
or hitting a car and losing the lead
the ai never misses the turn have usually  different set routes and sometimes will screw you bad
once i was about to win and one of the enemies pulled in front of me stopped his car and didnt move for a bit
i noticed all the other racers passed me easily
then there are the people you race against
they are extremely annoying constantly telling you stuff about how your driving is terrible or how you need to stop doing something before they get mad
i raced against this guy called angel he kept saying stuff through the whole match
i get second place he gets th and he still says i am terrible at the end
even if you beat your opponent but lose to one of the other racers your opponent will tell you all this stuff about how much you  i just wanna nail them into a gas pump and watch them explode over and over again
then once you win you get their carok so besides the campaign theres other modes
arcade mode which lets you cruise around the environments youve unlocked and battle mode which has detonate or capture the flag
they alright
you cannot customize cars in this game or build your own levels
i would of had so much fun building a straight track that goes for about a quater mile with other cars lined up watching me race my sister
however all you can customize are races and things during the race
weather traffic and daylight
you can set traffic to low but it still isnt a clear path
theres online play which i dont have the card to play it so i dont know what its likeso you wanna know what i think
the game is fun cruise around
go do some battle mode
make a race and see how you do
no high scores or anything but hey youre here for the adrenaline rush
the game definetly has that and makes me feel like im in that movie fast and the furiousas an adult gamer with only a precious few hours a week to play  im usually looking for games that are easy to pickup and dont require a  hours to master but still funi love arcade racing games not realistic sims
mcii definitely falls in the arcade class  too much at times
this game is easy to get started on right to the fun
no time wasted on qualifying and tricking out your car
the ps controls are easy and work well
every one here complaining about the control is either on a different platform or didnt play the game long enough to win other cars
every car has subtle differences in their handling
like any good racing game good cornering takes practice
cars like the vortex can fly around a corner at top speed while most will spin out if you dont slow down a bit
the usual cornering technique of letting off the gas as you enter the turn and then punching it as you straighten out works finein a nutshell i love to hate mcii
the career mode is completely linear so you have to win one race only first place is good enough after the next to advance win new cars and unlock paris then tokyo
this is very frustrating since if you get stuck on any race theres not much you can do about
you can look for shortcuts or look them up but even taking the shortcuts is far from a guarantee you will win unlike ssx
the shortcuts are often difficult to navigate themselves and half the time youre better off leaving them alone
every race takes several trial runs to learn the course
since the whole game is dark well it is called midnight club and the graphics are a bit pixilated many corners and routes are difficult to make out from any distance
its better to use landmarks like signs or count intersections to remember where to turn
many races you can follow another car and then past them in the final stretch with a boostonce you unlock tokyo la and paris will be a joke not only because you will have much better cars but the difficulty increases significantly for tokyomy biggest complaint with the game is the ai
there is one primary opponent and several red shirts
this is not you against several other racers
this is several other racers against you
the red shirts will do everything they can to take you out
they will blatantly teamup against you and crash into you especially at the start
you will be driving along at top speed when from out of no where another racer or cop car will spear you from a side street
not very realistic since i dont think real street racers would sacrifice their own chances for another racer
its believable that a car alongside you would attempt to spin you out but not such blatant spearing
this is what makes the game so frustrating since you can have a perfect run going and from out of no where bad luck ruins your race
of course civilian cars are always strategically positioned to be in the worst possible place for you but the computer cars will just whip right past themat the upper levels the computer cars are basically riding on rails
they will never miss a turn even at top speed
the best strategy in my opinion is to get the jump early and try to block or wreck gaining carswith all aforementioned negatives this game is very addictive
you will want to keep trying until you win a race
then you will want to check out the next race
ive never played this game multiplayer but it seems like it would be a great twoplayer gameif you like arcade racing games and just want to get playing this is a good game
if you like customizing your car with winnings and what not leave this title alonemidnight club iionce you unlock the fastest car in the game you will see what i meanpros  graphics clean frame rate cars are beautifully detailed many shortcults and crazy jumps
los angeles paris and tokyo are compressed versions of the real cities where landmarks are placed in the correct general locationcons very difficult gets a little repetitive after unlocking everythingi loved the first midnight club and i cannot wait for this one
its main feature is online play which if executed correctly could make the series as hot as gtagraphics
thats the one thing that docked this game of the fifth star
when i first saw this game i was at my friends house
i saw the game on the screen looked down and to my surprise saw that the gamecube was on instead of the nthese are not gamecube quality graphics
i really really hated the helicopter models especially ive never seen a uh turn so flatly
but graphics aside this game was superb
the gameplay is realistic and challenging
you have to use smart tactics make good use of your squads strengths and try not to expose your squads weaknesses in order to win
individually you have to worry about ammo and health
you have to be conservative or else youre running around the desert with nothing but a little knife for defensethe game stays true to the  war against iraq
the invasion of kuwait the scuds the f strikes the victory its all therethis is also the first realistic game ive experienced that allows you to move up both enlisted and officer ranks
your squad members start out as privates except your rifleman whos a sergeant
soon your squad members become officers starting as os d lieutenants
im always eagerly waiting for a promotion after each missiondesert storm is a great game true to life and challengeinga solid enjoyable arcadestyle war simgetting straight to the pointvisuals improved from ps version with better textures and draw distanceaudio an atmospheric score swells and ebbs in the backgroundgameplay as well as action and bloodshed strategy is also a key factor and balanced well against the other facorslifespan fifteen missions and also a very enjoyable multiplayer mode
should last more than a few monthsoriginality once again the game cube sharpens up one of the previously released ps games and succeeds
the strategic realworld action is unvailed well by the game cubeoverall score and thoughtsa good balance of strategy and action
an enjoyable waroh the ironywith a look as revolutionary as a futuristic car design auto modellista stretches the imagination to a whole new visual plane
if it werent for the disappointing controls auto modellistas road to glory would be carved into auto historythe radical look is the sole highlight of auto modellista
a celshaded world where even the raindrops fall in d makes up the games eyecatching design
everything from the tracks to the vehicles is painted in this nowunique cel method so it all stands out with bright sharp colors
the addition of wind effects craftily recreates a sense of speed as you rumble down the road in everything from modern rides like the mazda rx to classic muscle roadsters like the shelby cobra
but auto modellistas gameplay doesnt match its outstanding visuals
unfortunately the driving technique at the heart of this driver doesnt perform well
more often than not youll be frustrated with each cars mechanical ineptness as your vehicle will suddenly stop at a turn with a slight press on the brakes or when you attempt to powerslide
even tuning your car to the recommended specs wont improve your onroad manners
more disappointingly bumping walls at full speed will hardly slow you or your opponents down
in fact the only slowdown in the game is the reduced frame rate as you drive through heavy traffic on turns and in rain
an annoying game voice and hohum car effects round out the unspectacular featuresif not for the secondrate controls auto modellista could have easily taken the checkered flag
still its worth renting this racer for at least an overnight thrillthe first two clock tower games on ps didnt reach many gamers due to several reasons the first was one of the very earliest games and its point and click gameplay style didnt capture the public imagination
the second one sank pretty quickly too not even released in europe so i never played it
lets hope the same does not happen to the rd because its by far the best
playing as a young schoolgirl alyssa you return to your family home to find it deserted and before you know it you are being chased through time and supernatural dimensions by crazed killers
first let me say that the graphics and animations throughout the game are superb
its also one of the grisliest survival horror games i have played i certainly didnt expect to see a little girl bludgeoned to death by a sledgehammer or a sweet old lady drowned in an acid bath but nothing is left to the imagination here
the big feature of playing the game is that alyssa cannot attack any of the foes that chase her around the various levels instead she must merely run away or utilise various oneoff escape manouveres that can only be actioned in specific few and far between locations
it sounds frustrating but it actually works pretty well and the panic of solving a puzzle whilst a maniac with an acid spray or giant scissors is breaking down the door to your room always provided plenty of entertainment for megamers who like a fighting challenge are also catered for however as at the end of each level alyssa has to fight each maniac a different serial killer is after her in each level to the death
and its here that the games difficulty suddenly shoots up
much to my approval the boss battles take a fair amount of strategy and keen reflexes as opposed to the constant running and hiding of the main levels
and just when you think youve got the boss system down if you make it through to the last stage be ready for a pretty serious challenge in the final battle
the voice acting is very good alyssa and her family actually sound genuinely british
 and the locations and mad maniacs are all suitably horrificsadly the game seems very short and the areas that alyssa explores are all quite small although there are several stages to keep the player amused including a cemetary a hospital and an ornate castlethe spirit of the first game has been kept intact especially the sudden surprises of the killer leaping out unexpectedly at you but everything is improved although sadly there are no multiple endings like in the first game only one here
i would certainly recommend this game but its not really a game for children due to the graphic murders on display
but for the rest of us its good gruesome funi wasnt too fond of the clock tower series until i picked this game up
it definately caught my attention with impressive cg the music is pretty moody for the situationoverall for gameplay expect the d look your used to seeing in resident evil
run around find items solve puzzles avoid enemies and the like
but this game does have moments that will give you a good jump
and since you cant just blow them away with a gun like other survival horror games it brings a new kind of feel to it
plus it puts a little more strategy into your movementsthis game isnt perfect though some may find the puzzles too easy the game is fairly short and after time being chased by the subordinates can get more annoying than scary
however it is worth a look if not a purchase then at least rent itthis game is visually stimulating with a pretty decent story to match
some story events get dangerously close to a buffytype game a young teenage girl with the mission to destroy possessed demonshmmwhat makes this game really terrifying is that you have no way to kill your enemies
you can douse them in holy water to stun them for a bit but thats all
the only thing you can do is hide which does get a bit repetitive after a whileits a really scary game and id buy it if you love horrorthis game is strange yet exciting
moments of fustration yet a keep going mentality that wont quit to you get it done
its exciting and fullfilling at the same time
that i cant wait till its over to  i cant stand it anymore 
play itits cooli absolutely hate this game
i gave it  stars because theres no denying that its a good game the graphics are astounding and i give the makers props for doing something origional
i just dont like it
its not really scary just graphic
you see a childs head smashed in by a murderer right on the screen which wouldnt bother me except that its a child
they usually either dont kill children or turn the camera away at the moment it actually happens
not in this game
the game gives you a severe adreneline rush
its scary to have a huge man with a sledgehammer chasing after you in a house that you dont know and your only defense is a stupid little bottle of water and a single hiding space
i have two major gripes about the game
one once a guy is chasing you you go hide and he goes away
fine
but then you have to go out and do something you have absolutely no idea what youre supposed to do i had to go online and find a walkthrough or i never would have known what i was doing and you dont know your way around the place so youre frantically searching while knowing that at any second the bad guys gonna pop out and chase you back to your hiding place
its annoying and personally i dont like that tense heart pounding feeling that it gives you
second its just boring
its kind of neat to see the different places and people and find things for the ghosts but not that neat
and i thought it would be cool trying to piece together the mystery of how everythings connected but i got over that real quickthis is definitely a personal opinion and the game is absolutely well made
but think carefully cuz its not like other gamesafter the disappointing clock tower  clock tower  is a vast improvement
this one carries a completely new plot starring a girl named alyssa hamilton not to be confused with alyssa hale in clock tower 
alyssa discovers that she possesses the power to destroy the evil that plans to plunge the world into darkness
to do this alyssa must go into the past and help the souls of victims rest in peace by finding cherished items they possessed in life
this aspect is very fascinating and successfully frightening
when you get to the end of the levels you will see a cut movie of what killed these poor souls and how it was done
these cutscenes are amazingly executed and very entertaining to watch
after the cutscene it will be up to you to take out whatever villain slayed the innocents using a magical bow and arrowdont think that the classic run and hide gameplay formula from the previous clock tower games are lost in this one
throughout the levels as you look for cherished items to save the restless souls the boss for that level will show up randomly to give you a good scare
be prepared because scissorman and ghost head look like kittens compared to the bosses they cooked up for this new installment
when these bad guys show up be ready to run and hide in classic clock tower form however its a bit more difficult because the enemies are faster and smarter to a certain degree
also it seems that hiding places are fewer and farther between so memorize them quick or else youre in for some frustrating gameplay
to make things even more difficult alyssa reacts a bit more realistically
if she is very panicked shell stumble about as she runs making her hard to control
if she becomes to frightened shell stand very still and shake until her panic meter reduces
this makes parts of the game quite difficult but not unplayablethere are a total of   bosses in this game
they include sledgehammer the corroder chopper scissorwoman  scissorman somewhat amusing cockney twinsa far cry from the original and lord burrough which the battle takes place on the clock tower by the wayvery cool
a few of these are very challenging especially the last boss
i lost count of how many times i had to replay lord burroughs fight
however id rather bosses be a little challenging rather than too easy or else you end up finishing a game too quickly
in my opinion i think this game couldve used a couple more levels
i really enjoyed the time travelling aspect and the graphics especially for the ww era were simply breathtaking
the atmospheres were downright perfect for a horror game with fog old buildings deserted streets etc
as with the first two clock towers expect to get an adrenaline rush as you try to evade your enemiesthe sound and music in this game are near perfect
i found it very impressive
in the first level you get to hear a hauntingly beautiful piece by chopin called fantasy impromptu
this was a superb choice of music for the first story
it almost brought me to tears
the vocal acting is pretty good especially the enemies whom i found rather convincing with maybe the exception of chopperhis laugh could drive you to the nuthouse i think
i got a real kick out the scissor twinsi thought they were a riot
all of the characters that i can remember have british accents which keeps a realistic feel to the game since it takes place in england after all
it was sort of a nice change of pace from the typical gameson a final note i think what really made this game something extraordinary was the plot and the cutscenes
seeing the murders of all the poor souls really geared you up for the boss battles
the plot was exciting horrifying and even at times heart wrenching
alyssas pal dennis serves as some sort of comic relief in this rather serious game
the cutscenes could get disturbing so if you dont like a lot of horror and gore you should probably pick up a different game
if you can tolerate the gore then i think youll appreciate the story behind it and get several hours of gameplay out of clock tower   there is only one ending so no need to play the game several times over which i think was a wise choice for this particular clock towerthe game starts out eerie alyssa ltyutaka in the original japanese games
comes home after her mothers phone call is cut off at boarding school where she is supposed to remain until age  mother is missing theres a creepy man clues lead to portals
it keeps suspense and terror right up until you realize that youre doing the same things over again in a way its not on the horror level with fatal frame
the characters werent grotesque and nightmare enhancing enough
from the beginning in the house on to the sledgehammer killer in past london back into the house to uncover more clues to the hamilton family secrets  which include the female teens role as a demon killer kind of like buffy
to coverups its all new and exciting
the first killer is by far the scariest in appearence and vocally then it just sends you back after a different entity killer and another until youre fighting a teleporting clown girl and then her dragqueen brother
all boss fights are at a distance and involve the stick and  or  other buttons
the final boss is so far above the rest powerwise that its frusterating
i think the levels were long enough boss fights plenty long but there should have been something extra in between to make the game longer
i did enjoy matching stones and pushing buttons to achieve clues length of the game too short is why i took off half a star
the other half was because the killers werent consistantly frighteninglookingrepeating patern
total  stars because i genuinely enjoyed this game it was original and starred a girl  yay yutaka with some fright thrown inwhy i got this game and how i feel it relates to othersi bought this game very inexpensivechoosing the rd american game clocktower  because it was ps and because i had read a review that the previous ones were unrelated point and click type games which didnt seem too modern
so thanks to all of you who included that
i was looking for a game somewhat similar to fatal frame which i rented on impulse a while ago because i love asian horror movies
iii out soon  i dont understand why this or the fatal frame seriesterrifying is compared to resident evil  i played one of them dont ask which  and running around killing zombie things bored me
i have yet to play silent hill and i did briefly play another survivalhorror with mutant beasts in a mansion with an old womenwhat was thati just finished the game and my overall impressin is that it is in general a good game
more into suspense than horrorthe nice things about the game is that other than boss battles it is not a shooting type of game where you are a hero just blasting all monsters around with uber weapons
your only defence is a bottle of limited supply of holy waterthe annoying part is that sometimes you are just trying to find out about what to do when the damn killer shows up again and you have to run to your hiding place
this happens so much that there are times when you simply get very frustrated
the most annoying though not hard to hide from is the chopperannotther annoying thing is the controls
capcom made this game and it is pretty obvious that the reused the models from re so why the hell not reuse the controls
sometimes you change camera angles and you find yourself making a mistake and runing into a wrong direction
you get sort of used to after a while but it is certainly a bad designnow what is also terribly annoying is when you die on a boss battle and you want to continue then you will have to wait for the presentation of the boss again why not put you right where it says quotjudgmentquot
talk about bad game designi also found that i needed to pull a walkthrough for those times when you dont freaking know what to do
this is specialy true for the last part of the game where you go through the castle
i walked for minutes evading the annoying scissor freaks and being able to find nothing until the walkthrough told me i had to look into the candles
sighin general the game idea is very good and the suspensescare factor is very good too unfortunately the game is very short too
thes are the reasons why i gave it  starsin generalgraphics   borrowed from re not a big thing nowdayssound  music is good but special effects are also borrowed from re series no immagination here lots of reusegame plot   good enough to keep you interestedgame controls  a total mistake they made heregame play  as i said nice scares and nice conceptscare factor   good enought to keep you tense though they abuse sometimes and make you annoyedoverall this gamescary
it made me jump from time to time when a  foot serial killer suddenly leapt out from nowhere screaming my name
but jumping as anyone would to a loud unexpected sound does not mean you are afraid
it just means you are alive and have reflexes
a clock buzzer can make someone do thatno its a cool game
fun
but not scary
first the serial killers you find yourself eluding from in each level is much too cartoonish to be anything scary
they looked like they came right out from a comic book strip
and their voices
i dont think ive heard voiceacting as laughable as the ones used in this game
they reminded me of the wicked witch of the east ill getchu my pretty and yer little dog too
this didnt scare meit more or less made me mad
yeah you wait you little  i found myself saying more than just a few times
especially after working tirelessly trying to figure out some puzzle and having my concentration disturbed by some clumsy idiot that sounds like hes been getting high on nitro helium for the better part of his life who just will not
leave me alone
oomph there goes another controller against the walltotally different platform from the first  clock towers
this game is like a little girls dreamy bedtime story told by her aunt
the world of clock tower is like the words of a fairytale erupting from its parched pages animating right before your eyes on the television screen
even the music glitters it makes one think of spiral staircases running the darkening depths of a donjon tower
ora clock tower in this casethe first level is widely appreciated how the snow gently alights upon the scattered remains of a city that felt the full destructive effect of war alive with the cries of the dead
and you the sweet innocent girl from boarding school are caught in the middle walking the inactive streets with only the sound of a piano calling you to
the hard key pounding notes is of a restless spirit too distraught to accept redemption that you must alleviate before level completionthe second level starts out really good too
but the rest of the game just got ridiculous
id let a kid play itthe graphics have much improved since the previous  clock towers and it entertains the viewer with scenes of a huge clock erupting from the roof of an old english manor parting the clouds as it rises scenes that excites the heart with violent encounters with mass murderers that will attack and open wide the flesh with their implements of torture scenes that will dampen your mood as you see into peoples past livesfrom a father at war to a young man tending to the needs of his blinded motherin your search to alleviate the spirits that still cling to this earth staggering the sphere that separates our world from the next and reliving again the memory of the blade whence they were killedi bought the game because i collect anything pertaining to the horror genre but for someone who isnt as fanatical as i am who wants to experience genuine fear then i suggest to you to rent this game
its so short anyway
if you want to experience genuine fear then silent hill  or  should benefit you better
clock tower  or  also had its moments
but this game here isnt scary at all i guess it could be to some ladies out there unfortunately it takes more than this to scare a guy
but silent hill  made me hesitant to leave the house which i wish i could say for silent hill  what is it with third games being the loose end in the chain anyway
if it works in the first place why change itclock tower  a fun but unfortunately not a horrific gamewell i have put a solid weekend into xenosaga episode one and i can honestly say that i enjoy this title
i wont comment about the plot except to say that it is top notch any spoiling of the surprises would take half the fun of the game and any rpger would be sorry to miss ithowever flaws do come to mind
for example and this is minor this game is supposed to take place thousands of years before xenogears yet many of the characters which appear there have their roots in this game eg
citan uzuki obviously descends over thousands of years  from two characters in this game and minor characters from xenogears such as vanderkampf have relatives which look identical to their future counterpart
while im sure that some gamers think theyre cool whatever for getting these ingame references i would prefer more realism lets face it  how many people in the world even asians can honestly trace their roots back even  years
i guess its cute but whateveralso the graphics are nothing to scream about
in fact they are reminiscent of squares much earlier offering final fantasy viii and are nowhere near ffx
the characters in cutscenes are static  their hair doesnt move their clothes dont ruffle etc
the actual gameplay graphics are ok howeverfinally the cut scenes are a little too much
the voice acting isnt horrible and the graphics though i complained above are ok however the first  hours or so are dominated by cut scenes i know the story is rich and perhaps difficult to develop in the gameplay but i think the developers could have tried a little hardernow that i have ranted and really these flaws are minor i should praise
the story is magnificent and will pull the gamer in even though it develops on screen rather than interactively
also the gameplay is fun the combo system returns from xenogears but it is simpler and spelllearning is handled in a clever way
also there is a random effect which occurs every turn in battle eg
the next turn will have a boosted chance for a critical hit the following turn will have a boosted ether attack etc
the developers used this in a clever way at times but ill leave it to the player to discover just how it worksalso four minigames can be unlocked during game play
these minigames are fantastic and very involved ill give away only one of these  a magictype card game in which you build a deck throughout the game in order to vie for tournament victories and fabulous prizes
the games are well thoughtout but can be complicated at timesanyway ive rambled here
in summary this is a worthwhile game to own but the flaws are noticeable
i hope that namco and company can sort this out by the time episode two rolls around particularly the cutscene problemi loved this game
i could go on and on about it but so have many other gamers
in fact i will anyway but i will dwell upon topics that everyone else forgotgame play time namco claims  hours but i finished in  hours
my friends finished in about  this all depends on how much time you want to invest in side quests and such none of which i actually took part of
 hours in very overinflated i doubt this game will take anyone more than  hours to finish this is still a lot of timestoryline and cutscenesyou can skip cutscenes at any time by pausing and pressing triangle
those who do not want to watch cutscenes dont have to
people complain quite a bit about cutscenes
i did too when i had to sit through the melodramatic crap in metal gear solid  and final fantasy x but i cant say the same here
this game is made for gamers with an aboveaverage intelligence
yes theres melodrama but theres also a very rich intelligent story
this shouldnt come as a surprise to people who have played xenogears or those that know what der wille zur macht xenosagas own subtitle is
there are a lot of cutscenes
half of the first ten hours of gameplay will be cutscenes
after that however i found that  hour dungeon crawling with  minute cutscenes were commonplace
i highly recommend buying friedrich nietzsches book the will to power its philosophy is lightly carried through within the plot of xenosaga that is if you have the capability to understand what nietzsche is sayingaesthetics this game is two years old
it took an incredibly long time to translate the massive amount of dialogue in this game
thus the graphics are polished and goodlooking but not astounding
the music is decidedly minimalistic only using music for cutscenes or dramatic scenes
this makes it feel more like a movie
instead of desert town music or shopping music youve got a sweeping cinematic orchestrated scorei can hardly wait until xenosaga episode two comes out
xenogears fans nietzsche followers and intelligent gamers absolutely need to pick up this game
this game is only  of the story the saga is only just beginning but already it will blow you awayso far i like what im seeing in xenosaga
the cutscenes are very long but help in developing the story so its not all that bad
the battle system is designed extremely well and very easy to grasp the basics within a couple of hours of gameplayif you are planning to buy this game definitely do it because its one of the best rpgs ive played this yearnow i have to say that the graphics are great throughout the game
the only downside is that i must have been watching cinema for like  minutes straight you even were asked to save between cinemas cause it was so long
the times you do play though are very difficult and challenging which is whta i love
overall it is a great buy if like that much cinemaeven more than ffx
the battle system is something new with using up to three attacks per turn and using awgsbig robots to help you out
i just think this game was concentrated alot more on graphics and cinema than gameplayok i will start by simply saying i loved this game it was a lot of fun had a complex and compelling scifi story and it had characters with depth to match the story
there has beeen an overwhelming shortage of decent scfi rpgs and im happy to say this is the best one ive played since star oceanthe second storythe layout of the game isnt complicated
the battle system is traditional turn based and each charater has a different set of special moves that you can use to attack and upgrade to cause more damaage
encounters can be dodged by avoiding enemies and there special canisters in the environments that can be used to give you an edge against opponents
it doesnt seem like a wholee lot at firrst but the turn based battle system became much more fun as i upgraded more and more special moves and soon had characteers that could devastate any enemy group
even when my characters were this powerful the game still posed a challenge
this is a place where the game strikes gold it is one of the most balanced games in termes of ddifficulty
it is sharp enough to challenge you but not so much as to have you breaking controllers off the wall
there are even some battles that you cant possibly win through brute force and some of these encounters are done with very fragile characters
in these cases youll have to use strategy too defeat your opponents and this is something the developers did very wellthe story is absolutely incredible and very compelling
the story is very complex though even i somtimes forgot what was going when i didnt play it for a couple of weeks
still it has a deep richness of quality that the market is sadly lacking
the only reason i didnt givee this game aa perfect review is that the cinematic cutscenes suffer from kojima syndrome
the cutscenes in this game rival and possibly excede the length of the cut scenes in the hideo kojima series metal gear solid
metal gear solid sons off liberty had some of the most unruly and over extended cut scenes in game history
the cutscenes in thsi game are just as long and some may be longer
with a story this complex the long cutscenes are asking you to absorb a lot of information all at once
i didnt have a problem with this since i liked the story so much but for the common gamer this is a bit of stretch
despite tthis its a worrthy purchasewhen i saw the previews of xenosaga on tv i couldnt help but want this game
everything about it looked absolutely stunning
when i purchased this game last year thats exactly what it was like quotstunning to the eyequothowever when i played through this game i couldnt help feel like it wasnt a game i was playing but an interactive movie
cutscenes were long the graphics are too gorgeous to believe and the voice overs are done well
sometimes a scene would last up to an hour but this can be avoided by pressing start and choosing to skip the scene
i was promised over  hours of game play and  mini games
the game only took me between  hours to beat and none of the minigames i really noticed to even test themtruly the game was fun but not as addicting as other rpgs offer
the battles are turn based so you can take  minutes if you want to decide on your next move
however the use of a boost ability can make or break your battlesxenosaga can be challenging at times but not enough to make it a lasting game
what still captivates me is the characters their involvements and whats to come for xenosaga iiprosawesome graphicsgreat charactersdeep storylinepart  of a game seriesalso see xenogearsconscutscenes are long which isnt bad but some get too political and boring sometimes scenes up to  hour of watch timegameplay isnt as fun as many othersoverall its a must play for any rpg fan but should be overlooked by the impatient
dont believe neccessarily what the backcover says over  hours gameplay because all ready myself and others i know have played it in  hours
and when it is claimed to have about  hours of cutscenes thats only a  hour rpg which is very short
but then again a short rpg may be perfect for someafter playing through xenogears a few times on the psx in the past i must admit i was a bit sceptical when i first started to play xeonsaga
xenogears was a great game with one of the most interesting and equally confusing plots i felt ever had graced a video game
unfortunately the game was far what i would a truely fun experence due to its sheer length and the level of player awareness it took to get the most out of itafter i started to play xenosaga all my worries dissapeared
the storyline was amazing and on par with xenogears and i was pleased to see that it was free of that cram this all this story in one game andor disc feeling that xenogears had
while half the game is easily cut scenes and the other half basically consisting battles this didnt seem to bother me as much as some peoplethe character development and the battle system seemed overcomplicated to me at first as having three kind of points to distrubute among your characters different abilities made me wonder if i could manage this but it quickly became second nature
battle itself is easy enough to learn though the fact you only obtain money from certain enemies while realistic was somewhat annoying as i had to build up my money everysooften because i missed out on some of those investment emailsthe only thing i though wasnt up to par in xenosaga was the soundtrack
now dont get me wrong there are some wonderful pieces such as kosmos fighting theme the final battle theme that violin is just soothing and the appearence the song greensleves
the rest of the music even boasting the fact it was performed by the london philharmonic orchestra on the back of the case just didnt do it for me
also consider the fact the musical score doesnt play continously during gameplay like in most rpgs as the world of xenosaga is sometimes so quiet you can hear a pin drop
the music is ok but one will quickly realize that yasunori mitsuda did more with less on xenogears wonderful soundtrackbefore i wrap this up i would really love to know how this game got a teen rating from the esrb
not that im an advocate of the esrb or anything but honestly there are some scenes one in particular involving a nonplayer character strangling a little girl that just makes me wonder how much money did namco bribe the esrb withall that aside i would recommend xenosaga to anyone that likes rpgs and has the time to kill
dont let the complex character development system and complex story put you offfirst let me begin by saying wow
this games graphics matches any on the playstation  with in game play and cut scenes that rival even the most graphically advanced games ever
furthermore the futuristic effect the game gives makes the player feel totally embedded in a world where your only limitation is the amount of imagination you haveadditionally the game offers everything to the average hard core rpg player delivering every aspect of a great rpg that the rpg player dreams about in his or her sleep all packed into one gamethis in theory then creates the best rpg ever knownhowever unless you are the gamer who has to be a part of the action in every game you play this is not a game you would do well with
the cut scenes in this game are very long and sometimes not so entertaining
although graphically beautfiul these cinematics can be the games high point and low pointthe game is very good dont get me wrong just be prepared for some watching
overall you will watch almost  hours of the game before you hit even hit the half way point
the battle system is good although a little underdeveloped
enemies are not to diverse as seen in any final fantasy there are tons of enemies and battles do not seem to come along often
at times the player may feel like he is only fighting to get to the next cut sceen because the battles are short lived and sometimes seemingly pointless
the point system however is good
you build up points to put toward each attribute which can make the average perfectionist gamer go insane with  hours attempting to max out all statsquick tip to the wise save as much money as you can because it is really hard to come buy
you only get money from fighting soldiers and machines and it is in small amountsalso the ability to jump back to any spot you have visited is an excellent idea except that the difficulty level remains the same as the first time you visited
basically most places from the beginning of the game are not challenging at all which is not too much of a surprise
the only beef anyone may have is that they might want to go back to get items they missed and gain some decent exp and skill pointsthere are some mini games and sidequests but not to many
there is a casino but the payout is ridiculously high and it is very easy to get come cool items from the prize exchangethere is a sidequest to build the ultimate agws giant robotic units much like summons in final fantasy games and equally as cool looking although maybe a bit odd and there are also units you can buy even the monster agws that costs  gold
which may take a long time
i battled in a spot with high payout for over  hours and came up with 
so finally every aspect this game has seems to be wonderful but as with every game it has a couple of down points but it is absolutley enjoyable and i recommend it to anybody that doesnt mind watching the equivelent to two or three full length movies total before completing the gamethe ending will totally blow you away and chances are you wont even know you are at the end i know i didnt and was very surprised when i saw the ending creditsprosgame has beautifully rendered graphicscut scenes are breathtakingalways keeps you guessing and is never predictablehas battle system the rpg perfectionist would drool oversquishes all aspects of a great rpg into one insanely long gameconscut scenes tend to be overly long and not too entertainingyour family might miss you because you will be addicted to the shear greatness of the gameyour buttocks may become glued to the couch or chair and require prying offi have never played xenogears
from what i hear it was an underappreciated game on the ps
despite being developed by rpg giant squaresoft xenogears didnt possess the hype necessary to pull me in
i was too caught up in other franchises to pay the xeno universe much noticehowever all that changed the first hour i was into xenosaga
 game hours later and just  minutes ago i finished it
now im hooked and very much interested in what xenogears was all aboutwhat drew me into xenosaga wasnt the convincing futuristic atmosphere
it wasnt the slick graphics and impressive battle animations
it wasnt the superb music and sound effects
no it was the outstanding story and characters
these two aspects unfold in highly entertaining cinema scenes packed with perfect amounts of humor and drama
they do a good job of keeping you interested in the characters as well as the plot
theyre so professionally done youd swear youre watching a movie not a gameand therein lies one problem
as youve no doubt heard xenosaga holds the record for longest and most frequent cutscenes in any gameever
i for one never had a problem with xenosagas cutscenes
in fact they were the reason for me to keep playing
thankfully there is a feature to skip any cinema scene at any time so no one can complain thereif you like complex customization options youll love xenosagas menu system
at first glance its intimidating but spend some time going through it and youll begin to see how things work
thats also true with the battle system which may not be what most rpg players are used toall of the music in xenosaga is done by a full symphony orchestra and it sounds stellar
i just wish there was more of it
and i wish it wasnt reused so often
the best example of this is the battle music which never changes not even for boss fights except for the final battlesound effects are perfect throughout the game
battles are riddled with satisfying impact sounds
footsteps sound appropriate to whomever is walking around the environment
its all top notchthe only nongraphicsound complaint i have has to do with the best part about xenosaga the cutscenes
i would have liked to see the characters mouths move in synch with the english voices
its distracting but forgivablebe prepared for plenty of unanswered questions by the games end
the title xenosaga is accurate
seeing as how theres going to be sixseven parts this is one ambitious game series
im already addicted and this is only episode iimagine that far in the future a small group of people is driven together by a shared interest in preserving the existence of humanity in space
strange aliens that can cross from the spirit plane to the real in a moment who have an abiding hatred for humans and their creations are the enemy
their opponents are people range from the apparently human shion uzuki to cosmos shions creation and a deadly battle android
in between is every variation of the concept of human imaginablethis turns into a battle that rambles across known space with an array of scenarios linked together by an amazing amount of lengthy cut scenes
the battle system which involves human and mech fighters and a large number of weapons skills and spells is complex and a bit frustrating as well
it is never easy to make basic leveling up and power decisions
game puzzles abound but the real focus is the fighting and everything around itdid i mention the cut scenes
they are well done and acted but there are so many that they can be tiresome if one decides to go back and refight some key battles
it is hard to criticize an rpg for having too much plot but xenosaga may be the one
especially since the real plot is still a mystery to be resolved in later episodes
for now what we get is continuity and strange hints about the past and futurecharacters are excellent
shion a young woman scientist is sublimely irritating as a heroic figure
her supreme interest is cosmos sometimes to the exception of the rest of the human race
cosmos is a beautiful and efficient killing machine who is more concerned about her looks than her body count
i also fell in love with momo another android this time built as an yearold girl with a charming smile who cheerfully apologized to dealing enemies crushing  blows
the rest of the team is equally interesting with many secrets and many of the supporting cast are allowed full development as wellon the whole the game has two flaws
the first it that it overdelivers
there is simply too much of what it does do well making it difficult to form an effective development strategy
since this keeps the game from being simpleminded it is a good thing
however novices like me find the possibilities hard to manage until well into the game
in addition despite the battle complexity and cut scenes it is still essentially a linear story with a small number of side quests that can be done out of orderthe other problem is the player interface
it may be luck of the draw but xenosaga uses several controller presses exactly the opposite from the past three games i played
if it did this consistently i would not mind but often the reversal is haphazard causing redundant and nonsensical controller moves
i was still fumbling and cursing well into the game and this contributed heavily to my problems with the gameall in all this is a very good game with a couple of minor flaws
i wish every game tried to be as much as xenosaga does
the interface which was my worst problem can be overcome
if namco maintains this level there is much to look forward to in future episodesif your rpg has a character index and terms glossary built into the game you can figure youve got a pretty complicated game
unfortunatly this doesnt always mean a fun gamethis game is a prequel in spirit to the ps rpg xenogears and features mostly the same combat mechanic of stringing together button presses to make combos
it also features long cutscenes with a heavy empathsis on foreshadowing and mentioning characters and terms who dont show up until hours later into the gamethe graphics are impressive and the music is one of the few ive heard in an rpg that hasnt made me want to cut off the sound
i wish i could turn off character voices however
theres too much leveling up and enemy imbalance though and the ending is mostly a let downdespite all that the game feels longer than the  hours it takes you to play though perhaps due to all the gambling for coin and leveling up needed
but is still a headscratching make you say huh enjoymentxenosaga is a fun game
almost on par with its predecessor xenogears namco did a great job
im glad they revived the series with something new
as for the other two sequels that go to this game uuummm no comment
but if youre looking for a little something to pass the time give this a whirl
its one of a kind
on a side note this game has a few bible references
one of the most memorable ones is straight out of the book of revelations and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works
and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire
the lake of fire is the second death
and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
also theres a character who has a mark on his right hand labeled  he is known to be manufactured in a lab according to the game
also theres a few crosses youll notice here and there
one is peters cross upside down in a church at one point of the game
also theres another church that has the catholic cross with jesus on itwhy would namco put all this in a scifi game
beats me
maybe the director is spiritual or maybe the crew felt christianity would be something that would survive all the way to a scifi setting thousands of years from now
who knows
just want to put that out there for anyone of the christian faith
ok moving on
some things i enjoyed that arent seen in too many rpgs nowadaysvoice acting they must have hired on a bunch of hollywood actors because its just amazing
youll laugh youll cry and even get the creepssidequests and a few mini games
a lot of game companies seem to have forgotten what makes a great game these days
things to do besides the main quest that award the player
xenosaga is huge on this concept theres even mini games that are  player so grab a friend soundtrack
type in miracle xenosaga in youtube search
youve most likely heard this tune somewhere and its definitely one of the best written pieces of music in gaming next to sephiroths theme
this game has a great soundtrack
although theres no music playing in towns or battlefields
lots of silence but when there is music lookout
its going downthe battle system is fresh and doesnt stray too far from xenogears
which makes this an epic winning in my book
they just added more to it like enemies on screen skills you can learn ether attacks special attacks
also theres still the feature to fight in a gear agws on the field which rocksoverall its a pretty awesome game i didnt care much for the next two installments
maybe ill try them again in the future but xenosaga by itself stands strong as an rpg
enough saidhappy gamingdont get me wrong i enjoyed this game and am waiting for the sequel
but you spend almost as much time watching the cutscenes as playing the game
and the storyline can be a bit confusing
still when you do actually play its fun
and the story and characters are quite goodif youre an hardcore rpg fan youll want this gamethats the one thing youll hear about this game all day long
long cutscences
im not talking ff kalm long i am talking  minutes at some pointsbut lets look at that a bit closer
the fmvs are masterfully done
the sound and graphics are superb and i certainly didnt mind watching any of them
the story is very well done on all accounts
namco was also kind enough to include a very handy skip option on the fmvs in case you die and start back before a long fmvso the fmvs are long but they are quality
what about the rest of the game
well it definately doesnt disappoint
the level of customization of character is great
bonus points are awarded after battles which can be used to boost stats learn new abilities improve exsisting abilities or pluck skills out of items
this really adds a lot to the game and makes all those battles go a bit easier knowing that youre building up those upgradesxenosaga also manages to add some action elements into the game
you can shoot various things in the world to damage or paralyze enemies
in one of the earlier battle encounters you have outmanuever an invincable enemy through a corrider
its not just random boring rpg battlesthere are also a number of minigames you unlock through the game
the battle game which seems pointless but is amusing theres a full card game very reminsince of magicthe gathering the good ol casino where you can win some eqiupment and items and a drilling game which also gives you items and moneyso yes the fmvs are long but they are well done and tell a wonderful story
but there is also so much more than long fmvs to this game
give it a try its a solid rpgthough i havent played enough of it yet xenosaga seems to be one of the most original rpgs ive ever played
never in my life have i played a videogame and recieved email ads about other games from the same company who produced this game
it has excellent graphics but there are some jaggies many jaggies
overall give it a try give it some time and you will like itxenosaga episode  der wille zur macht is a stunning game really
while xenosaga carries on the name quotxenoquot as in quotxenogearsquot do not expect to find a copy of xenogears in this in anywayxenosaga opens up with an extremely long cutscene very very long
that introduces a part of the plot
the game then later shifts  years into the future where youll see your lead character shion a scientists on the ship encephalon
she begins a simulator with the android she created kosmos
after shes done with the simulation her ship comes under attack and the story beginsxenosaga takes the battle system of xenogears and evolves it into something much bigger
youll string together combos and use points
theres a guage down in the lower right hand corner that shows the battle order like in grandia
the pic thats furthest to the left attacks first
itll show your enemies as well
thats for each round
you then can select to attack and string together combos to deal out some damage
as usual enemies have certain weaknesses
it isnt just an elemental weakness but a attacktrait weakness as well for example some enemes are weak against slash based attacks
the battles can sometimes be long though as the animations arent exactly fastthe field is unique as well
xenosaga eliminates quotrandom encountersquot and now youve got contact based
you can also interact with objects on the field you can blow some things up
if an enemy spots you it will give chase and some you just cant outrun no matter how hard you try
so its not bad as far as the field goesthe graphics on xenosaga are visually stunning
there are some parts that flash a bit but the d animations and beautiful cutscenes better make up for this
the flashing is minimal and not noticeable to manythe music stands above all else when we actually hear it
the game actually opens up a lot like a movie and its even got the dramatic score to go with it
but then there is music that is absent from other parts
when we watch cutscenes sometimes theres no background music at all and that makes some cutscenes boring and unentertaining to watch
the voice acting is topnotch
and while the game has a lot of cutscenes it greatly helps the character developementbut thats the problem with xenosaga
there are several cutscenes that further push the quotvideogamemoviequot trend
in other words there are tons of moments where youre watching the game and not playing it
not only that but xenosaga has it bad
some cutscenes are just too long
as i said it opens up like a movie and the cutscene is incredibily long
there are more long cutscenes where that comes from
your clock will read well over  minutes when you actually get to play and roam the field for the first time
but there is good news
you actually can skip these cutscenes
if you pause the game you can press triangle and skip them
its great that the plot can unfold through these cutscenes but the cutscenes are just too longxenosaga also has lots of minigames and sidequests
the minigames arent frustrating but they do take some time to get used to because the learning curve for them takes a lot of timethe game isnt bad but im afraid that because the cutscenes are really really really long i couldnt give it a five
a great game that id recommend to any rpgerthe goodbeautiful d graphicsgreat character developementunique battle systeminnovative original and intriguing plotthe badincredibly long cutscenesno music during cutscenes only makes them seem longerdo you like rpgs
does the thought of kicking alien butt using a curvaceous female android excite you
does the thought of over  hours of cinematics cause you to drool
how about a heavily religiouslyovertoned philosophical and moretwistedthancourtneylove plot
then fellas you have found your game
now dont get me wrong i do like a game that presents a challenge
however when you realize that some of the discussions in the game make you think that you are reading a treatise by nietzsche rather than playing a futuristic space operathemed rpg then you have to wonder about the sanity of the developersstorylinei really think that the developers of xenosaga set out to create an epic story first then developing the gameplay after they created the arc
this is not necessarily a bad thing however there are several moments in the game where you actually are asked to save after watching  minutes of a cutscene only to then proceed to another cutscene
sometimes you gain control of your character merely to walk into another room then another cutscene starts
what this really boils down to is this if you want a short bit of gaming to fill a smidgen of dead time in your schedule this is not the game to do itthe story is meant to detail how shion and kosmos get mixed up in the fight against the gnosis as well as the larger plot of an antigovernment organization called utic
it is a good story however it is told too frequently and through too many cutscenes
xenosaga is a game that places you in the roles of several characters whom you will meet throughout the story however your primary character is shion
shion is the head developer of the android kosmos
in the world of xenosaga an alien ghost force called the gnosis are invading the planets of the universe and killing off all lifeforms
recently even an entire planet disappeared
playing as shion you are charged with creating the second version of kosmos a bluehaired female android weapon used to battle the gnosisthat being said the game starts out with you aboard the military spaceship woeglinde
after a brief training session in a computergenerated world which is designed to get you the player acquainted with battle controls and the like the story then progresses to focus on the character development of other members aboard the woeglinde with shionwith all of the cinematics in the game which should really serve to clarify the action of the gameplay you would think that you have a great story on your hands
and well the story is great if you can put it all together
with the fictional names in the story such as the alien menace called the gnosis for instance combined with a lot of germanic references one spaceship is called the rhine maiden your head will spin
i used to think that final fantasy was bad but for some reason since all of the names and creatures within the final fantasy series are completely madeup i am less confusedgameplay and controlswhen you finally do gain control of your characters the game is really fun to play
large d environments which are heavily detailed are used for each area
the game also allows you to visit previous maps through an ingame umn service in case you missed anythingthis game controls a bit differently than most playstation  games the o is used to execute a command and x to cycle back through a menu
this takes a bit to get used to as in most instances the universal playstation execute button is the x
it is a minor difference really as you will get used to it quickly however it is annoying when you first encounter itduring the course of the gameplay you will sometimes control characters outside of the usual shion
shion is the main character of the game and your save function will always reflect her level regardless of whomever you may be controlling at the time of the save
the nice thing though is if the characters you are controlling gain a level shion will too
so you could be controlling ziggy for instance and he could get to level  shion may have been at level  when you saved her last however when you control her again she will be at level  this is a nice feature and does eliminate some of the grinding other rpgs may force you to do in order to balance out your partys character levelsonce you have acquired all of the characters you can switch them out in between battles
this is a nice feature also as you are not necessarily restricted to a certain character
since all of them have different attacks and abilities this helps out tremendously in some of the boss fightsboss fights in the game are insanely difficult
one fight is essentially entirely random
the boss will unleash a devastating attack against your entire party when a certain event occurs which is determined at the beginning of the fight
you have no control over the event
unless you happen to get lucky you could literally have the boss unleash his super attack against you every round entirely decimating your partyin other boss fights the levels are sometimes so much higher than your own party you do not stand a chance
their hp hit points or health levels are so high and your damage ratio is so low that you will spend literally an hour trying to eliminate one boss
when the rest of the enemies in the area are so easy by comparison this is very frustratingon the upside there are no random encounters
enemies are clearly visible on your screen and radar and will only run after you if they see you
while some fights are forced as in any rpg you can avoid others if you use the map to your advantage
this is helpful when you simply do not feel like fighting
the downside is that the enemies respawn when you leave the room and returncontrols are tight and actions are menudriven
this is a turnbased fighting system and standard rpg fare really
you are able to complete a physical attack in addition to ether magic and agws mechs
there is some strategy involved however as you can withhold an attack to gain an additional attack the next round
overall though the strategy only pays off in boss fights when the extra damage you would gain from the third attack may spell the difference between your defeat or the bossgraphics and soundgraphics in this game are colorful and beautiful
the characters are animated nicely and the d environments are large and detailed
facial animations are not really well done though and lip movements are horribly synched with the speaking
that being said the voiceovers are amazing
the english translations in this game are topnotch and each character has a distinct voice actor
whether it be shion or kosmos for instance you will know immediately who is speaking without looking at your screenthe cinematics are gorgeous
if you have ever seen the movie final fantasy spirits within the graphics are similar but the cgi ingame are lowerquality
the facial animation and hands are probably the best examples of this somewhat blocky in certain instancessound epic beautiful and not annoying
the battle music is repetitive but not so much so that you would turn it off
plus if you did you may miss a cutscene which are so frequent that they could literally spawn in between battlesoverallthis is a fun game and certainly has a deep detailed and heavy storyline
if you can deal with sitting long periods between gameplay to watch a story unfold this is a good game
if the thought of having a  minutes of playtime to  minutes of cinematics scares the willies out of you move on to another game
for those of you that take the time to get into this title it is engaging and fun
some of the attack names are quirky and the dynamics of the gameplay are frustrating but you will want to play all the way through  if only to clarify the myriad of cutscenesxenosaga is namcos prequel to xenogears an rpg released on the original ps a few years ago
what sets xenosaga apart from most traditional rpgs is its futuristic theme and deeply philosophical story
nonplayable cutscenes are plentiful though perhaps at times overwhelming in length some scenes run almost an hour without any breaks
however story is a vital component in any rpg so sitting through them isnt much of a chore if one keeps that in mind
gameplaywise xenosaga borrows some of the best elements of todays classic rpgs
battles play very similar to how one might expect with standard attacks magic ect
mechtype summons called agwss are an interesting addition as well although not all that important in the later stages of the game
there is some conflict thoughfor such a linear game in terms of the path the player is forced to follow the character and agws upgrade methods seem needlessly complex
its seems there are different types of points to earn for every attribute so it becomes easy to neglect upgrading certain aspects of your party if youre not careful
another fault i feel needs to be addressed even though i know this was intended to be episode  of a long running series the ending provides few answers to the storyline for the  hours of gameplay one must put in to finish it
xenosaga is definitely an ambitious project but those without much patience or experience regarding games of this type should probably consider a less complex rpg to start with
if complexity and a deep meaningful storyline are what youre looking for however by all means this is your gameooo my god you get to run around and watch these cutscenes that make the game more of a dvd than a game
seriously though
i got  for my bday and i wasted  of it on thisthisyeah
its booring as hell
please people do not make the same mistake i made by buying this gamepros interesting plot memorable characters memorable locations good music and sound interesting battle systemcons only rd of the series music is poorly implemented long loading times uneven difficultyother thoughts  keep in mind this is the first in a three part series  and that the second game is pretty bad
thus unless youre willing to play the bad second game and very good third game you will probably not end up satisfied in the long runi like to start with the bad and then move on to the goodthe levels can be tricky to navigate and you may waste a good deal of time trying to figure out how to proceed
the game has a slow start in that you do not get to fight a whole lot for a while
being that the game is about the quotactionheroquot indiana jones i would have included a lot more fighting and a lot less figuring out the path
bullets  of which there are not enoughdont seem to put men down fast enough and the whip is almost entirely useless against humansthat aside the fist fighting is a whole lot of funeven without slowmotion punches and kicks
the learning curve of the controls is fairly easy and the graphics are not bad at all
being that i have only played through the first  or  levels i hope the pace of the game picks up
if it does ill stick with a rating of four stars
if not i would give it three stars
i would recommend that you rent firsti finished playing through this game recently on my playstation   as a longtime indy fan i must say that i was very very pleased overall
you control the intrepid indiana jones as he makes his way through a variety of locales including ceylon istanbul prague hong kong and others
the goal of the game is to recover an ancient mystical talisman from the titular emperors tomb all the while fighting off nazis chinese thugs undead creatures and others
indy is present in pure form including the fact that he occasionally loses his beloved fedora hat during a fight and must go back to retrieve it when the coast is clear
i dont know who they found to do indys voice acting in this game but whoever it is did a great job impersonating harrison fordthe controls are intuitive and easy to master
indy comes equipped with his revolver a canteen of water for health replenishment and of course his trusty bullwhip
during the game indy will gain access to a number of other items including a variety of weapons ranging from german machine guns to a crossbow to a variety of blade weapons
i must admit though that whenever i was up against only one or two bad guys i found much more fun in just wading in with my fists or else breaking furniture and beating the bad guys senseless with a table leg or breaking a liquor bottle over their heads
indy has a number of different fighting moves so fighting enemies never gets monotonousthere are many puzzles to be solved in order to advance in the game
some of them involve finding an item to open a secret door others involve distracting a large nasty monster so that indy can quickly get across a dangerous area to safety others require indy to have a key item in his posession so he can view invisible obstacles etc etc  the actionbased levels dont disappoint either
whether you are fighting off reanimated statues dodging flamethrowerwielding nazi soldiers or perched atop a chinese mountain gondola car trying to shoot down german fighter planes intent on your demise there is always something new to defeat
i found that the various levels of the game did an excellent job of presenting new challenges and the action never felt stalehaving said all this why  stars and not 
well there were a few things which detracted a bit from the gameplay
one was a few graphical glitches such as an object that is visible from one angle would suddenly disappear when indy moved
this didnt hurt the gameplay but it was distracting nonetheless
a more serious problem was the fact that the game crashed a number of times during play including twice while i was fighting the final boss
there were a few other minor bugs although nothing too serious at least as far as i encountered
i get the feeling that maybe they should have tested the game a bit more before releasing it
also the graphics themselves just seemed a bit dated and primitive for the ps
at times i almost felt like i was playing a very advanced nintendo  titleeven though the graphics were a bit flawed i have always felt that graphics mean little if the gameplay itself is worthy
this title has plenty and more of great gameplay value
if you can get past what few flaws there are in the game then this game will deliver many hours of enjoyable playtime
highly recommended for all indy fans and anyone else who enjoys heavy doses of action and puzzlesolvingaccording to the indiana jones timeline indiana jones and the emperors tomb takes place immediately prior to the events in the movie indiana jones and the temple of doom
if you play the movie to its conclusion it fits the pieces together well
im not really a gamer but have played more video games in the last few years than any other time in my life except when i was growing up with an atari
im also a fan of indiana joneswith that said i really enjoyed playing this game
it wasnt terribly difficult but there were quests in the game that were challenging to complete
the graphics acted up every now and again and didnt appear as defined as they probably could have but i didnt have any major problems playing the gamethe games story line goes something like this  indy is approached by an asia man who wants to hire him to find an item called the dragons heart that is located in the lost tomb of the first emperor of china
the nazis are looking for the item too and mysterious employer wants indy to find it first
unbeknownst to indy this man from asia is really in cahoots with the nazis
of course indy eventually learns of the plot is helped throughout the game by a ninja lady named mei ying
indy travels from the jungles of ceylon to prague to istanbul and finally to china
along the way you get to fight and kill a ton of bad guys from ivory traders to nazis to demonpossessed chinamen shoot fighter planes from the top of a gondola spear a giant octopus and tangle with a frankensteintype monster
all for fortune and glory babyin the course of beating the game if you are successful in collecting all  artifacts there are  in each level  you can go back and replay a level to collect them later if you wish you will unlock an art gallery that displays all kinds of concept photos sketches and designs
just by viewing these pictures you can get an idea of the development process because there are several sketches or photos whole levels that can be seen which arent a part of the game
besides these missing elements it is also rumored that the character of abner ravenwood marion ravenwoods father was to have been in the game as well as a boat chase levelnow usually i dont like racing games unless its a good classic such as mario kart  or something
but usually i dislike racing games
on this however you can customizeinvent your own car and more
the gameplayracing isnt too bad itself
there is a big selection of nicegood cars such as mercedes clks toyota supers and much more
if youre a racing gamer this game is worth buying if youre like me rent it first or play the demo before you think about buying itunfortunately the problem with buying old games that used to be great is they sometimes often arent
i had memories of playing this game back in the day and though it is still unique it is not as fun as i remember it
slow boring repetitive gameplay and lackluster customizationstill found myself generally intrigued though and would still recommend to someone looking for a unique racing game with decent graphicscolin mcrae rally  is definitely one of the better rally racing games available to date for playstation in north america
whereas most rally racing games tend to lean toward the arcade side of the racing genre vrally  and especially shox being two recent examples of this colin mcrae rally  is closer to the simulation side of the racing genre
with this in mind colin mcrae rally  is definitely not a game for just casual players of racing gamesthe most noticeable aspect of the simulation style in cmr is the quotlackquot of ability to win at even the easiest gameplay level
in many rally racing games winning is practically quotguaranteedquot at the easiest levels of gameplay this is good so that those games can accommodate players of varying skill levels especially those games trending more toward arcadestyle gameplay
cmr however makes winning at even the easiest normal difficulty somewhat of a challenge
proper vehicle tuning is definitely a requirement with extremely little leeway for tuning errors
precision steering is also crucial to success meaning that the player must have an instinctive ability to read the lay of the land to determine all the possibilities for the roadways next change of direction  this occurring independent from the calls from the navigator and if activated the navigation aids at the topcenter of the screen
nearflawless racing skills in general are also a prerequisite to good performance as is proper pacing ie never overextending neither the vehicle nor the players abilities
the simulation aspect of the game is also noted in the threeseason championship mode cmrs version of a career mode
of course having nicky grist as ones navigator with the englishlanguage audio only adds yet more realism and simulation to the gamean interesting and perhaps perplexing aspect of cmrs simulation focus is in the times posted at the end of each rally
vehicles begin each rally in accordance with their points in the championship or how they ended the previous season if the first rally of a new season this quotrunning orderquot is used for the entire rally
at the end of a stage the player is shown her or his time and rank compared with those who ran the stage earlier
generally the only way to determine the players rank amongst all the participants in a rally is to wait until the next stage is about to begin the only way around this is to be in last position in the points at the beginning of a rally meaning that the player will then be the absolute last competitor on each stage of the rallyinterestingly the final stage of each rally is a super special stage
these are headtohead competitions on a parallel circuit course similar to the annual race of champions
here there are two lanes which generally run parallel to each other with minor variations and a crossing point
a vehicle completes one quotlapquot by starting on one side of the startfinish line and returning back to the same side which requires this crossing the startfinish line twice
unfortunately the player will always start from lane  the leftmost lanefortunately the player is not forced to continually win in order to unlock items in the game
winning will often reward the player with a bonus vehicle which can generally only be used in stage mode where the player participates only on a single stage
however simply finishing a rally is enough to unlock more or better parts which will often be needed in the upcoming rally
finishing a rally also unlocks that rallys opening video in extras modethe graphics and sounds are quite stunning but the main area of quotbeautyquot in cmr is the vehicle damage
the vehicles in cmr do indeed suffer damage and it can be quite extensive
virtually every dent incurred can be seen instantly
windows break bumpers fall apart the hood flies off wheels separate and the bodywork crumples like a sheet of paper
as the vehicle incurs more and more damage vehicle handling becomes trickier and trickier and can only be repaired at the next service area
the only downside to this is that there is no rearview button  sometimes actually being able to see the damage on the front of the vehicle can persuade the player to modify driving style andor reduce the level of aggression in order to complete the stage and ultimately the rallyfor those who are very very very serious about their racing games colin mcrae rally  is definitely a prime choice
for those who look purely for fast speeds without requiring a lot of finesse especially on circuits cmr is definitely not a very good choicei have been waiting for this game for a long time to come to the ps
ive tried all the others and had to get this too see if it was worth all the hype
in a nutshell id say is was
it is  very well balanced and is just real fun to play once you get the feel of the game and make your way through the racesthe main downside of this game is you may only play as colin mcrae and you must drive for ford using ford focus cars to race in championship career mode
and your codriver nicky grists voice is a downside but you can mute him
once you unlock the bonus cars you can only play them in practice or time trial which includes the suberu impeza mitsubishi lancer and some goofy ford vehiclesfor some reason they did not include the hyndae elantra or the toyota corolla 
there are only eight different contries but they all are very fun to drive through with great scenery
this game gives you the opportunity to race through usa tracks as well as japan tracks which is a rare treat for rally fans
this game does have a lot of different car settings for engine suspension breaksect as expected but there is a catch to that
you have to play through the game in order to unlock the upgrades for your car
and in order to unlock other vehicles you must have the best average time in the end of each of the  rallys
this adds a lot of repaly value and new cars to look forward toa major benefit of this game is the reality of the damage you can put your car through with outstanding sound effects of glass breaking and crunchingits really fun to just play a track to beat up your car
you can even get your car all dirty then drive through a river and come out clean
the attention to detail is incredible hereid say this is a definate buy for those rally fans who need something new you wont be disapointed
 starsi wasnt sure if i wanted to purchase this game because it got so many bad reviews from magazines amazon reviewers and gtvhowever because i love puss n boots and because of the recent price drop i decided to give it a go
well its not like final fantasy as many have compared it to
its more like gauntlet dark legacy
the graphics are really good
to address another criticism the game is not a cheap movie novelty created from left over scrapsmy only complaint is that you cant choose the characters you want for each level they are choosen for you
however you can switch from the  characters given and most of them are coolfun factorreplayabilitygraphics controlscamera anglesmostly young teens and under will enjoy this game
even if you dont like shrek this game will appeal to grims fairy tale fans like me
i got mine new from ebgames for only hurry before they are goneone of the poorest games ever developed
the opportunity to make something truly fun was missed
the graphics are poor
you essentially control four players at once
the voices are bad immitations
i could go on but you get the idea
buy it used if you buy it at allnow this game is somewhat fun from what my brother tells me
he says it  stars
now i never played the game but i watched it be played and what i can say is that its a great multiplayer game you can be shrek to many other characters and it seems like a fun game to play
downside i guess my brother is either to good or just plays too much because he finished the game in what two weeks max
so good game for multiplayer with all its other bonus things and short campaingthis game is a lot of fun and the concept behind it is simple but genius
you basicly control four characters and on the way solve puzzles get new friends defeat bosses and gat photots for your scrapbooka great game for the whole familythis game blows the n spiderman game right out of the wateri feel even more like spiderman in this onehoweveryoure a bit too much like spidermantheres people calling for you to do random jobs no matter where you goyou dont just stick to a wallyou must push a buttonyou are very very fastyou have a shedload of moves and manuvers you can performall this is well and goodbut still have to go and be peter parker tooso theres meeting mj for dinner datesvisiting your aunt maybeing a good friend to harry and taking photostheres even pizza deliveryi find spidey hard to control and do better just flailing about when fending off multiple thugsan example of a cool move is you can spot a robbery a block and a half wayrun all the way into the fray at amazing speeds and just clean a crooks clock with a devastating uppercutbut as he flies through the airyou can jump up there and boot him all around the air before he ever hits the groundits so coolthe bosses are pretty roughif not for the over complicated handling systemitd have gotten a  star ratingthis game is absolutly hugethe city is giant and you can travel across it with no loading timesthe swinging system is new and definetly improved
theres nothing like the feeling of free falling off the empire state building and catching yourself at the very last second
the grafics are great excluing the character models
the fighting is quite fun you can web up a guy fling em around your head which nocks everyone around you away then hang the guy from a  lightposti mean come on thats just fricken awsomethe only down thing is the missions get a bit repetitive
but you can spice em up by using different methods different attacksthis game has alot of substance it will keep you busy till fable and halo  so buy this game and have some funthis game is incredibly beautifully made
the graphics the physics the freedom they are truly amazing
the horizon of graphic is pretty far there are many interesting things to explorebut other than being gorgeous the game simply lacks gameplaythe missions are all very easy
the enemies are all very easy and the gameplay must have been geared to a younger group of players than me im on my early s
the only true enemy of spiderman in this game is water
all the fights are easy rhino and all of them just fall very easily and there arent even that many of the more special enemies that try to make it challenging
the only truly difficult parts of the game are the ones that involve water the duel over the statue of liberty and the final battle against dr ock both involve the constant risk of falling on water and since that kills you at once it is the only true challenge in the game
i find that annoying and frankly a bit oldthe side quests such as finding sckyscraper special locations and stuff are a good idea reminds me of grand theft auto but frankly there is no payoff
you find all of them and all you get is a medal on your status screen saying you did it
who cares
there are so many things that could have been added such as different costumes for spidey changes to peters apt and etc
again similar things have been done before for example in gtathe random missions are very repetitive by the  time a armored car was being robbed it got to be pretty boringthe game still is pretty funny though the voices are made by the actors from the movie so they are greati just wish they had spent some of the time they used making the amazing ny in the game creating some more story and gameplay insteadthe  memorial in the game was a pretty neat and sensitive inclusion thoughtitle spiderman description spidey takes to the new york skies once again in this very loose psuedoadaption of the movie
become a hero assist citizens and fight super villians
in this free dwelling new york landscape that is anything but linear
you could explore the city for hours and still find new things
descend skyscapers and take pictures bust up car jackers visit the statue of liberty and even rescue the occasional childs balloon
there is so much to doplatform xbox reviewed ps and gclearning curve  expect to invest alot of time learning how to manuver spidey
about everything on this game is timed and as such you need to move fast and you have to keep up with your wall crawler
you almost have to get spidey to be an extension of yourself
expect to spend about  hours unless your quicker to catch on than me to get the midgrade understanding on getting the most out of spideys locomotion
once you get this stage of learning through
spidey is easy to control and he is very versatile
i think players will enjoy all the possibilities with this kind of controlreplay value  there is sooo much to do in this game it would literally take months to do it all
the city is huge
there are also a ton of rewards you can work for and lots to time trails scattered throughout the city
you gotta be really fast and have spider reflexes to do some of these fun challenges
excellant indeeddifficulty  i am only guess on this one as im about about half way through the game but so far this seems a fair assumption
the game does seem hard but i think it will be defeatable to most decently experienced players
the bosses can be hard but i think once youve gotten spideys higher locomotion functions down they should prove to be no problem
the key here is finger dexterity and patience
realize you will have to do some things multiple times to get it down just right
to master this game and get everything id knock this difficulty rating up to about a 
i can be an enjoyable frustration for hardcore fans though
it is also not really necessary but the city maps helps me the most
i dont really suggest a guide unless you are planning to do everythingpros huge city map for exploration character movement versatility improved physics for added realism classic villians and bruce campbell returns to help narrate the story along with toby mcguire and alfred molinacons some times the controls get choppy i gotta problem with spidey wanting to spring off of buildings instead of latching and the wall sprint could have been easier if it didnt share the grab button
i understand they had to blur building detailing to speed the graphic engine for swinging and web zipping but it creates a generic feeling to buildings in the distance
saving people on sinking ships and getting buoy tokens  i added this just because i hate doing this
spidey always seems to overstep and land in the water
time expected to invest a month to beat the game with the majority of neat stuff accomplished 
i expect it will take  months to get everything
suggested purchase price this guy is worth the full purchase price to fans but curious gamers will prolly want to mid  dollar cost frameoverall  unlike most movie games this one is good
this is far better than the first spidey and i enjoyed it
i recommend this one for purchase
i think after you get the hang of it youll enjoy this title is much as i amthe short go anywhere anytime in a full version of manhattan
crawl buildings or swing all day stop random crimes or take on the story
similar not to gta but true crime but too unique for direct comparison
not as horribly difficult or badly acted as ive read but it could use more variety in some areasthe long when i was first debating buying this game i kept seeing comparisons to grand theft auto
i will immediately tell you this is misleading
you dont steal cars you cant beat up civilians and theres no big series of missions to take from different people
it has a couple similar elements to gta but in fact the game plays more like true crime
like in that game you can co anywhere at any time your missions revolve around random street crimes and aside from a main storyline the bulk of the games fun is coming from exploring and building up your records
this isnt to say spider man  isnt fun on its own because it is
and its different enough from most other games to really stand outthe game starts you off as spidey and guides you through a brief but helpful and humorous tutorial delivered by none other than the man bruce campbell himself
after that its up to you
swing from the rooftops stop random crime help citizens in distress or take on the main storyline
its all fun thanks to the great graphics and controls
the games gravity and speed system gives you a very proper sense of weight and control over spiderman and its a definite blast to just zip around through the rather large cityfight controls are in my opinion good as well
like a true comic book hero spidey does all kinds of goofy leaps and flips mixed in with the fisticuffs
you can literally run and knock an opponent fifteen feet into the air jump up and kick him down then throw a web to catch him before you land and throw him against the side of the building
its wild and although you can simply beat guys up with one button the joy is in all the different flourishes and moves you can execute
and after seeing the films again last week i was surprised by just how many specific moves they took from the movie for inclusion into the game
still theres also a sick humor in just grabbing a mugger webbing up to the top of the empire state building and hurling him off
yes the game lets you do this
and yeah its funthe random and distress crimes are fun enough as well but their downside is that like true crime they boil down to the same core missions when its all stripped down
it doesnt matter if the enemies are robbing a bank or stealing a purse itll still come down to you chasing down the baddies and beatin em down
theres some variation that involves spideys particular skills like rescuing hanging construction workers and people from sinking boats but after a while the crime stuff does get repetitive
in all honesty i didnt have a problem with it until a good week after playing and finishing the game but some will tire more quickly of the lack of variety in the actual objectiveswhich leaves the storyline which can pretty much be followed at your own pace although most of spideys coolest moves will be unlocked this way
the actual story mode follows the general course of the movie but throws in much substance and characters for filler and can probably be beaten in about a dozen hours for a casual player
some like egm magazine have made the boss battles seem ridiculously impossible but i hardly had a problem with any of it
the toughest spot for me was a sort of obstacle course i was forced to participate in pretty early on but this type of story mission occurred only once and the rest to me was just fine
the voice acting was perfectly adequate as well with no one sounding particularly worse or better than they sounded in the films again egms review notwithstanding
the same cant be said for the citizens though who sound quite dumb but in a fun somehwat conscious waybut if all the rest of this stuff doesnt grab you theres still loads of optional goals to complete
there are literally hundreds of icons to collect in the city as well as races to try to win and small secrets to uncover minor spoiler dont expect too much other than pride if you expect to collect all the green info tokens
this is one of the more wiseguy jokes ive seen in a game and youll either laugh or cry after all that work
so heads upin my honest opinion spider man  is a hell of a game
its just plain fun to rush around the city while web slinging crawl to the tops of skyscrapers and swan dive off and beat up countless thugs with crazy moves
i put in about  hours and a lot of that has been spent just exploring and collecting
its good enough in the substance that it borrows from true crime and its unique and well made enough on its own to really stand out
i really enjoyed itwelli know absolutely nothing about this game except that it is gonna come out sometime
but since it is going to be the sequel to an already good game ill say this the first one had good graphics good gameplay decent fighting and a load of web slinging moves
plus it was a really long game and it had that cool metal gearesque training mode and all that extra stuff art movies previews so in all reality it would be absured if the developers went and made the sequel crappy so this game is most likely going to be great
i predict better graphics better gameplay more moves tons of extras and boom there it istop line great game and the best spider man game everenvironment  out of  manhattan is perfectly recreated
people walk by chatting and yelling stuff like quotgo spideyquot when you pull off something cool or quotmenacequot when you swing over their head
cars move around and you can surf on top of themkids will lose balloons and you can deliver them back to them thiefs will attempt bank robberies ships will sink and you can have your say in setting things rightgraphics  out of  while the city is perfect characters are sort of weak
in upclose shots you will notice how people look like a ballon with a human skin attached to itphysics  out of  great stuff
the best part of the game is just swinging around its so cool you will almost get dizzy on it
moreover you can pulloff some style combos while flying around and this will get you energy back and make you have even more fun
its like having an ssx game put into a super hero gameplot  out of  the game follows squarely the movie adding however a bunch of side quests
side quests do get sort of weak after a while thoughthe bottom linethis is truly a well done game
buy it if you are by any means a comic fan or a spidey fan if you saw and enjoyed the movie if you like action games with awesome physicsi bought the game yesterday july  and i have been playing it ever since
it is gta without carjacking meets thug without skateboarding meets the spiderman comic book
this game is amazingly fun to play if youre playing the missions or just taking a spidey tour of the big apple
this game does not stick to the storyline it adds characters in such as mysterio shocker and black cat
it does use the storyline of the movie as a plotline basis though
the one problem that i have with this game however is the graphics
i feel that they can be much better than they already are but in a game as fun as this who caresi buyed this game mainly to have ms pacman and dig dug at the palm of my hand by the way its a kind of relief that there are adults like me that like to play those classic games and have their gba because sometimes i feel weird playing this thing at the lunch time in the work d the ms pacman and dig dug are beautiful translation from the originals and they are as adictive too the gala
games are not my favorites i prefer the space invaders and if its the space invaders from the atari much better
but they are fun to play and adictives nonetheless the pole position is not so good is hard to play and there are a lot of games better than this one but is a nice additionthe only and fatal i may add flaw of this collection is the absence of batery backup to save the scores i dont understand this because the goal of all of the games from the golden era of the videogames is to make as much points as possible and challenge your friends that they try to erase your record but this is a great game for the olders like me and the nostalgia of those games are undennyableits like having my own portable aladdins castle
if you dont know what that is youre too young to truly enjoy this collection
this is a great games
ms pacman digdug and most importantly galaga
if you used to shovel quarters into these games as a kid you wont be disappointed with this cart
the only reason i didnt give it  stars is that there really should have been more games on the cart
cmon you expect me to believe that the simple pixels that make up these games take up all that memory
i suspect this will not be the only quotmuseumquot cart that namco puts outbut ill probably buy those as well
i was also surprised at how addictive these games still are
my wife tapped me on the shoulder last night and said quotdo you realize that youve been playing galaga for  hours straightquot
cant get enough of the classicsnamco museum ports five classic games over to the gameboy advance ms pacman dig dug pole position galaga and galaxian
if you grew up playing these games theyre timeless classics
younger audiences probably are expecting more out of a game than the limited technology of the s allowedthese games are recreated very well with only a couple of minor issues largely due to the adjustment made going from an arcadesize screen to the tiny gba
the sounds are crisp and faithful reproductions of the bleeps and blips from our childhood
the graphics arent jazzed up in any way instead celebrating the bit glory that was the golden age of the arcade
the biggest port issue comes with ms pacman where you have the option of playing on a shifting screen  the gba screen doesnt compress each maze very wellthe biggest drawback to this game is the inexplicable lack of a battery backup for high scores
the game records high scores as per normal but those scores are immediately reset when the power goes off
points did matter with these games and its nice to see how high a score you can record
unfortunately namco decided to skimp on this feature
that decision is disappointing but the games themselves are still worth playing to those who grew up playing on their ataris
after all theres nothing wrong with nostalgiaim a  yearold arcade fanatic and happily recall my days in the arcades even if i didnt play for long or play all the games
the classics never go out of style hence the term quotclassicsquot and namco museum is no exception
sound is crisp and clear with near authentic sound effects and gameplay just like the arcade versions
im a nitpicker though so here are just a few gripes in pole position the quotqualifyquot voice message is different and a few of the signs are not the same as the original
galaxian and galaga are finally together i finally get to see the difference between the two
the only gripe with this is you need to play in sunlight or a light adapter or you cant tell the diff between passing stars and a missile
these are just minor gripes and im sure pole positions changes are just customized alterations to get used to
so whether youre home or on the go play gba namco museum housing nicely restored classics on that surprisingly small cartridgethe game is only  so if you do buy it its not like your spending  for a game you wont like
i thought this game was really enjoyable although i have played many games with far superior qualitythe games are all pretty interesting and they all have their flawsbut when i learned that these games were invented so long ago i cut them a little slacki didnt grow up playing these games so its not a walk down memory lane for me but they are still fun gamesthis was also the first game i got for gba and personaly i think its a good game to start out on because the games are simple and easy to follow and the controls are relativly easyits especially good for kids who are not quite ready for hard and indepth games yeti also like the fact that its not just one classic game but pacman is my favorite gamebut its a little hard to beatthere are two things that really get on my nerves about this game oneyou cant save any high scoresso there is absolutely nothing to beat in this game and twoin galaga the screen is only half the size of the gameboy screen they could have put the scores at the top and had the screen be double the size that it isbut overall this game is very fun when you just want a little something to keep you entertainednamco museum for the gba is a really good retro game
individuals  years and older will remember these games well
for those individuals who are younger than  namco museum provides an opportunity to play some of the classic videogames that started the whole video game frenzy
namco museum consists of  games
ms pacman galaxian galaga dig dug and pole position
ms pacman everyone knows about
galaxian and galaga are space invader type games dig dug is a unique digging and destroying enemies game and pole position is the classic arcade steering wheel racing game
all games are great fun for a quick pick up and play
the lack of a battery save feature for high scores reasoning for  stars is sort of a disappointment but writing scores down is not that tedious of an ordeal
overall namco museum is a great port of the arcade classics that can be popped into the gba for a quick  minute game between class meetings or a lunch break and is a good addition to everyones gba librarythis game could have been better
at least the graphics arent like the video paks
theyre like the arcade
i like how they put in  versions of ms pacman
the sound though is slightly inacurate
try comparing the level themes in galaxian and dig dug and the start theme from ms pacman to the original arcades
i know they did it in the original namco museums but they fixed it in namco museum th anniversary
the game is fun and i love pole position and dig dug but i think it needs more
the question is why not pacman
well they included it in pacman collectionthis game i got for a bargain
 for this game and it was worth it for me
it lives up good games mrs pacman dig dug galaga galagar and that racing game
all are good except for  thing it cant save
all my high scores in mrs pacman gone
but still its good for inbetween classes like break time
it is really great
overall  stars to this cuz it cant save
but that is it
the rest is all in heaventhis version of namco museum includes all of the arcade games that were in the nintendo  version with the exception of the original pacmanthe games included are ms pacman galaga galaxian pole position and dig dug
all of these games contain simple gameplay but it is very addictingoverall its a neat collection but you might overlook it for something like super mario advance due to the fact that the arcade games are the only things on the cartridgeits rather disheartening to see the quality of sega games going down the gutter these days the only good game to come out in awhile was condemned  bloodshot
the golden compass was hailed as garbage iron man was also reviled by all critics sonic has been in a downward slope for years and the new hulk game didnt receive great reviews
but when you revisit classics like these on the genesis saturn and dreamcast youre reminded of the good times plus quite a few good games on the ps and xbox
vectorman is one of those games that for some reason or another sega never revived it neither in console nor handheld form like many of its fellow sega brethren
i have not played the first vectorman but this sequel is highly polished and rather solid for a sidescrolling shooter with platforming elementswhat the game is when vectormans ship gets shot down he crashes on a planet and must escape and defeat numerous enemies
so in good old sidescrolling form you shoot lots of enemies and jump onto platformsgraphics it has the dd look
the environments are designed quite nicely and the game is rather pretty
i like the enemy exploding effectsmusic it has a quiet haunting feel to it
it is nice music that goes along with the gamesound shooting enemies dying your character dying sometimes and his onelinersgameplay the controls function quite well and feel very responsive and reliable
the game can be difficult though and you can die
also sometimes certain platforms are tricky to reach and there are times when you miss them and fall to the ground
but these flaws are easily overcome by the addicting gameplayoverall if you own a genesis you should pick up this game and demand that sega does a rerelease of this game
its a highly polished and exceptional sidescrolling shooter thats fun for anyone
now sega along with rereleasing this title you should also think about digging into your saturn and dreamcast catalogue of titles and reviving them if you hope to survive as a publisherthe good great gameplay good music good graphicsthe bad platforming can be trickyive always viewed ultimate mortal kombat  as the last of the original mortal kombat games
the mortal kombat series after ultimate mortal kombat  would change so drastically and branch off into so many unique dimensions such as mythologies sub zero that the series would become virtually unrecognizable from the original series whereas the first installments on the bit systems mortal kombat mortal kombat  mortal kombat  and ultimate mortal kombat  all have a likeness to one another even if they all possess noticeable differencesi have always felt that the box and logo for ultimate mortal kombat  had the best art
the black light  ultraviolet purple light cast on the realistic skeleton bones always seemed to be a bit more on the brooding side and a step up from the traditional dragon logoone major disappointment of the original mortal kombat  was the characters
subzero was changed to an unmasked character which corrupted the mystique of the original subzero
also scorpion  and reptile were completely left out of the game which many fans hated since the masked ninjas were favorites
kitana mileena rayden and baraka were replaced by the likes of sheeva sindel kabal nightwolf stryker sektor cyrax and robot smoke
brought back were sonya blade and kano after being left out of the second installment
so how did the mortal kombat series improve off of these mistakesthey included everyone
every mortal kombat character was now playable
every character that got slighted from the third mortal kombat was now included and given new fatalities friendships animalities etc
on top of that characters like jade and human smoke which were secret enemies and hadnt been playable before were now playable
masked subzero was brought back and naturally scorpion was given a slightly different appearance and was also again playable
ultimate mortal kombat  even went ahead and took it a step further by throwing in the likes of noob saibot and ermac
ermac was the legendary mortal komat  hoax that proved to be nothing more than an error message with no actual screen shot as proof
new masked ninjas chameleon and rain were even now playable
the list of selectable characters was really pushed to the limit in mortal kombat  in fact because of the sheer magnitude of the list this title truly deserves its namei do not recall the arcade nor the console release being a runaway hit
while i do remember the social ramifications and raging success of the first mortal kombat the incredible hype and success of the second installment plus the success of the third as a console release ultimate mortal kombat  seemed to be viewed as a tired afterthought as other fighting games were starting to really enjoy the scene as well
the street fighter series the chief rival of the mortal kombat series was enjoying good success and other new fighting games with their own unique gimmicks such as dinosaurs fighting in primal rage and the ultra cool ultra combos of the killer instinct series were sharing more of the fighting game genres booming success
ultimate mortal kombat  despite having so many characters and appearing to be the mortal kombat game that fans were supposed to be in love with it just didnt reach that levelthe super nintendo port is of course superior to the genesis port
better sound better graphics and enough buttons on the controller make it a nobrainer as to which copy is more enjoyable to play
personally i like this game a lot
in fact i would venture to say that if this game had come out instead of mortal kombat  fans would have loved it more
or if mortal kombat  didnt have so many new characters and so few old characters fans would have enjoyed it more
instead we have mortal kombat  which is the black sheep of the original series and ultimate mortal kombat  which is just a copy that corrects the mistakes of the same thing that makes this game great is also its greatest weakness
there is just too many characters
no one could ever master every character because each has their own set of special moves combos and finishers
its just too much
it kinda makes you wish that some of the newer unnecessary characters had been puposefully left out so that more of a game could have been made out of thisin the end i suppose it is better that we have all these characters to choose from because if some had been purposefully left out it would have aggrevated someone who loved that character
ultimately this is a great installment of the series even if it is the only one that collected dust during its dayi agree that it didnt live up to the arcade version but i kept in mind that the arcades era had far surpassed the  bit realm when this game came out saying that i think the genesis did a decent job carrying umk and i am happy with it i am a sega genesis collector myself as well as a mortal kombat collector as well while its no mkii for x it was a enjoyable game and not a bad arcade to genesis port considering what year it was portedi used to play this as a child so it was a must have for the collection but didnt come with casethis game was not a final fantasy but much like today a bunch of wanna be final fantasies are released why to sell a game that might not have sold otherwise
it doesnt really matter if this is saga or secret of mana final fantasy adventure the fact is that its still a square title
plus if you were looking for an rpg when this game was out final fantasy and zelda were all you had for gameboy
this game kept my interest it wasnt until gameboy color tho that portable rpgs existed in the mainstream so given time and place a good gamethis game is definitely a improvement over the first
the first was like many other first game in any series  simplistic etc
this installment is definitely smoother and more polished with more of a story and more world to explore and the graphics are a bit smoother than the first decent for gameboy
once in a while you have an additional character join your party temporarily but for the most part its just you and three other players you choose
you can choose between humans mutants male and female robots and monsters
personally i went with two humans one m one f a male mutant and a robot
like in the first game your weapons have a limited use usually  times and your magic books also have limited use
this can be really annoying but is fairly manageable
overall definitely worth tryingi liked playing this game as much as the previous legend game
i remember that with each game i was pleasantly surprised that the graphic was getting subtlety better
i really like roleplaying games so graphics is not everything to me as long as i do not have to make something up myself to continue the play
hum was that water i crossed
no i do not want to do that and you dont in this game
seeing the beginnings of a series you really like can be a cherished experience and in turn a wonderful memory
therefore if you do not mind simple graphics and like roleplaying games you will like this gamei really liked this game when i was littlethis is the only godzilla game or anything to feature bagangodzilla vs destroyah was supposed to be godzilla vs baganmy only complaint is that when regular godzilla goes threw buildings he gets hurtthis game can be taunting and hard but the actual gameplay will keep you wanting more
plus this was the first and only game godzilla ever became super godzilla
the battles are well thought out and the story is decent
the grphics are way advanced for a super nes game
overall if you like godzilla and none of the next gen games are proving fun pick up this titlethis was a really awesome game but it is very difficult game
the person who sold it to us was very reliable and the game was in good shape
it is a one hit youre dead game but thats okayit just makes you addicted to it and makes you want to come back with a vengence against the aliens
would i recommend this game
yes because it is fun and challenging in an addicting waythe sequel for the arcade smash hit was pretty good on the sega genesis
for one thing the gameplay is topnotch and the graphics arent terrible the fatalities are pretty cool and the stages are done well except living forest and the tomb ill get to that laterthe game is really tough so you better have quick reflexes and lots a patience all of the characters from the arcade are selectable along with a couple of secret characters called smoke and smokin
hot babe jade
there are a few things though that really bring this port down thoughprobably the biggest is the sound instead of having crystal clear roars and unique sounds that made the mkii in the arcade ground breaking are not present here unfortunately
the music is also pretty wierd it sounds like a drunk dude trying to jam out on a satar and a drum machine wierd i know lol
stages like the living forest the trees dont roar and also when you select your character their names arent announced like in the arcade in fact there is very little speech in this game all togetherhonestly if you want a really good version of this game grab the snes or the rarely talked about x version that is also really awesome
there is also a port of this game on the saturn and the playstation and those are good toothis sega version of the mortal kombat sequel again fails to compare to the super nintendo version
this time around the graphics are much better and the fights are much more fun to play
if you still have the genesis and wanna own a great early mk game this is the way to go
you surely wont be wasting your money on this gameafter failing to conquer the earth realm through tournament battle shao kahn decides to get straight down to business and send quotoutworld extermination squadsquot to north america
thats the short version of the main background story for mk
naturally a new crowd of fighters along with some of the old lineup gather to either put a stop to it or encourage it
there are fourteen fighters to choose from
old favourites like shang tsung liu kang kano sonya jax subzero and kung lao return
the new fighters include sindel shao kahns quotqueenquot herself sheeva the first playercontrollable fourarmed character kabal a weird warrior with a mask cyrax amp sektor two quotautomatedquot ninjas from subzeros clan stryker a batonweilding cop and nightwolf your typical culturepreserving red indian
the gameplay itself has changed from mkii
now theres a quotrunquot button and new quotauto combosquot the fighting has been speeded up quite a bit and the fatality time is very reduced
mk reduces the strategic approach of the previous games and is more geared towards button mashing
the basis of auto combos is choosing the right button at the right timesince mk takes place mainly in north america there are no more shaolin temples
the character and background graphics are quite good in the snes conversion
the graphic resolution has also improved a notch from previous mk games
in a couple of stages performing an uppercut on your opponent sends him through the roof of that stage and the fight will be transferred to the stage directly above
thats a tad innovative as fighting game ideas go
aside from fatalities babalities and friendships mk introduces the quotanimalityquot which requires quotshowing mercyquot towards your defeated opponent before it can be performed
as for the fatalities they are fun to watch like liu kangs quotmk dropquot and kabals quotugly facequot and gory at the same time though not as much as mkii
for the first time in the series the player had the choice of three paths to take either novice warrior or master
music and soundwise its okay as far as mk games go
fluid controls too though they shouldve made some of the finishing moves a bit easier to perform
the computer ai artificial intelligence is quite aggressive even in the quoteasyquot modeif you have the previous mk games dont hesitate on this one
though not as original as mkii if you got tired of its slow pace and want more diversity in the finishing moves mortal kombat  is for you
to get the most out of it however you should play with the cheat codes on
mk also marks the period when williams entertainment instead of acclaim started developing and distributing the mk gameseither you get mortal kombat  or you dont
this installment really shook up the formula from the first two so much so that even fans of the originals werent sure what to make of it
fan favourite characters have been removed to make way for newcomers and many returning characters have changed appearances
backgrounds in keeping with the games evolving storyline are now more gritty and urban
there is a run button and the combo system is preprogrammed rather than free form
even the harsh edge of the fatalities seem to have been toned down
theyre still gruesome but also more tongue in cheek and outrageous than beforeits not a bad game at all and can be pretty addictive and rewarding once youve mastered all the moves and uncovered all the secrets
its just a style of gameplay thats harder for newcomers to get into and a large departure from other series such as street fighter king of fighters etc
but considering it became the basis for the rest of the d entries in the series umk mk trilogy its a gameplay style players will need to get used to
certainly the snes version does nothing wrong with sharp graphics control and sound that are faithful to the original arcade
if you like brushing up on your old d fighters now and then mortal kombat  is worth checking outbetter know those codes or know where to find them otherwise awesomeif you are going to get the game genie then make sure it comes with the book because i had to buy it separate at a flea market are you can go online and get a lot of codes for the newer games that dont have codes in the book yetmost know of the history and the sega saturns fate
the system was extremely popular in japan
however a high price point over inflated ps specs and the big dumdum himself bernie stolar the saturn never took off
finally after  years i finally purchased one
one thing about the saturn it is the most reliable practically bullet proof system
although the ps had better d the saturn was better at d
the gap between the two systems d performance was small but the problem was tapping into the saturn multiple processors
also the saturn had more ram and better sound than the ps
the system launched for  the reason the high price point
well upon learning of the ps specs mainly its d capabilities
sega at the last moment had to add additional processors to at least give the system some d performance
this drove the price up of the system
sega misread the then publics affinity for d gaming
however this wasnt entirely segas fault no one could predict this at the time
at the time when d fighters where still the rage
also dumbdumb bernie stolar didnt want any rpg games
stating that the west never really cared for them
at one point the imbecile stolar said well the saturn didnt have many good games
i mean geez like seriously thats like a music label saying well his cd didnt have any good songs
also another major sega screw up they released the system as a surprise
this seriously backfired on them and many retailers didnt want to deal with sega after this
essentially the sega name was already tarnished at this point and this bought up a huge struggle for sega next system the dreamcast
both system are still loved by many loyal fans
even though many of the games areor been released on xbla and other such mediumscompeting against the ps the saturn didnt stand too much of a chance
sega had killed their reputation with the sega cd and the x they had made a machine that was hard to program for and sony had a machine with better d hardwarethat doesnt mean the saturn isnt any goodthe good built in save memory
no need to get a separate memory card although it was recommended great library of arcade style games especially firstparty sega arcade ports like virtual on and fighting vipers
 easy import support just use an import cartridge or an action replay plus no soldering needed
 excellent controller
the saturn controllers are considered some of the best digital controllers ever
 quiet
unlike say the dreamcast the saturn barely makes any noise when in operation
even when the disc is being heavily accessed it has a very low noise output
 excellent d visuals
d games with saturn and ps ports tend to have better quality graphics on the saturn although this isnt a completely solid rule
but in general this is the case
 considered to be durablethe bad the save battery needs replacing after some years and when it dies your saves get wiped
best to invest in a save cartridge which is expensive or an action replay plus which can backup saves but you cant save or load it during a game only from the action replay menu
 the lr buttons on the controller feel like crap which is odd considering how nice the rest of the controller is
 loads of the best games are import only and you may need to import to get some games cheaply such as burning rangers
 limited developer support
 d graphics tend to be worse than on the ps
not saying that the saturn couldnt compete but this is a fact the saturns difficult to code for architecture was a hindrance to its visuals
later game releases tend to match better against ps visuals
 no proper sonic game
big problem for a sega console
sure you could play the classics with sonic jam race with sonic r or play what is pretty much an isometric version of flicky in sonic d blast but r and d blast arent too good and sonic jam is just a compilation
 the cases nonjapanese games come in are disgustingly fragile
theyre gigantic jewel cases
 early sega game ports tended to be a bit of a mess such as the first virtua fighter glitchy polygons and daytona usa choppy framerate and horrid popin
later ports drastically improve though such as with virtua fighter  buttery smooth fps and i resolution and daytona usa championship circuit edition with better graphics higher draw distance etcverdictits a good console in its own right
it has its exclusives like panzer dragoon and nights its a great system for anyone who wants more pickupandplay arcade games and as a whole its rather nice
with one of the best controllers ever and a unique library picking up a saturn might probably be quite a good ideaokay so first ups had a little glitch
they apparently cant read as the apartment number was right there on the box
because of that it ended up being a day later than the tracking info said but still half a month before the edd
so far the system is in fairly good condition
ill have to superglue a couple of plastic pieces back in on the casing but thats not that important
though ive had the system for a couple of hours and it has gone back to the control panel midgame twice on me
not sure why but im looking into it
all things considered however this was an excellent purchase and id highly recommend the sellersega saturn a game console that could and likely shouldve been far more sucessful then it ended up being at least outside of japan anywayits a console that is both insanely well designed and incredibly poorly designed depending on how you look at things
its certainly one of the most remarkably sturdy consoles of all time which condering when it was brought to market and against which systems from its era it really is remarkable
you just try and find an early model platstation that is still functional and play it for an extended amount of time cause if it isnt busted or half busted it soon will be
the saturn on the other hand is a tank surely some of them can and will break down and die overtime but if you have a saturn and take care of it at all youll likely be covered for a system indefinately
they are whisper quiet run cool and are exremely well constructed with an insanely high build quality both for the system and its controllers
personally i believe had sony playstation had similar build quality that they wouldnt have been  and beaten the sega saturn on price which was a major factor in the playstations early success which is how it gained such momentum
i know that had i known how fragile a ps was back then that i wouldnt have dropped my money on onethat being said in terms of giving developers a good console platform to work on the sega saturn missed the mark badly at least for d gaming and that sealed the systems fate when paired with the systems higher pricetag it just looked like a poor value with a higher pricetage and games not looking as good in d and developers complaining openly to the media about how difficult it was to make d software on the system early on
now in time sega would develop better software for the platform to show it could compete and give developers better tools to make game with but the damage was doneas if that wasnt enough trouble for the platform it was also derailed by very poor management choices from that era that chose to release the x genesis add on basically as the saturn was coming out in japan which burned retailers gamers developers and sega themselves as nobody benefited from its release accept maybe sony
then after that fiasco cost many people in sega their jobs they hired a man in bernie stolar who had no interest in saving the platform but only interest in moving on with what would end up being the sega dreamcast now he did a good deal of good in pushing sega to make good choices in its design of the dreamcast but he basically killed the sega saturn with his choices not to localize many of the systems best software from japan where saturn was in a viable and fairly successful second placehe then took it a step further by telling the press at a major event e  that the sega saturn wasnt segas future which was the death knell for sales third party support and caused many retailers to pull the system from shelves altogether
now maybe the system still wouldve failed to limp its way until the dreamcasts launch anyway but his actions made damn sure it didnt and keep in mind it did make the finish line in the other two markets
no matter which way you look at it he is the reason why so many of the best saturn titles are so expensive and or have to be imported from overseasi dont know how much different things wouldve been if grandia panzer dragon saga shining force  vv burning rangers etc wouldve been availible here but i cant see how it couldve been that a man running an arm of that business thought it wasnt worth trying to supply a game console with its best availible softwarewhy do i post a review about this in  with all these details about the system and why it was what it was in the mid s
it makes collecting games for the system in todays world much more expensive then it ought to be
the expected issue with collecting for a disc based system from the s would normally be finding hardware that still functions or controllers that arent shot to be a the issue but alas sega made fantastically durable hardware in fact id wager its got a lower failure rate than that of a couple of nintendos cartridge based systems nes and n but the rarity and cost comes from the games especially the great ones that normally would be quite cheap on other systems as the best games tend to not be raresadly that isnt the case here on the sega saturn
system is a tank controllers model  especially are outstanding and not hard to come by but its best games
you might have to resort to modding the console or being quite rich in order to buy them and play them its really a damn shame tooit works well as i brought it for a friend
i knocked a star off as the battery for saving dies rather quickly despite how often you change itthe sega saturn achieved much success overseas but it never really took in america thanks to sonys playstation
originally designed as a replacement for the aging sega genesis the saturn was to be designed to be the ultimate d system that was until sega learned of sonys plans
however there are a lot of good qualities about the saturn the game library features over  games the saturn system itself is the most trouble free system ever made the d analog controler which was an early prototype of the dreamcast controler was the best on the market the best conversions of d games are on the saturnit was the first system to introduce online play and its library of rpgs is fantastic
all in all the saturn may have not been the best system but it was pretty goodgreat sports game because it combines the action of basketball with its own sense of fun irreverence and personality  the gameplay is amazing the announcer is hilarious the hip hop soundtrack is tremendously good the players and their abilities are precise and unique and the ai serves up plenty of surprises
plus you can create your own characters mine is fat with a huge afro and he dresses like a bum but hes great at long range shotsi dont play many sports games
theyre great and all but im more of a gta devotee  i like shooting i like driving i like blowing stuff up
still the weekend after someone loaned me their copy of this game i had to buy it it was just too much fun and even a year later continue to pop it in and play awaythe game is the best
it got street legends like strech bonifide and biggielittle
it also has bill walton magic johnson and even larry bird
it has a pick up game nba challenge where you try to beat every nba team and legends and it has to be a legend where you create a player and try to make him a legend
it has a lot of new courts too
if i was you i would buy this gamethis game is great and is one that you can play for a few hours
it doesnt take long to master the controls since they show you what everything does before playing the game
the modes are pick up game nba challenge be a legend and street school
pick up game is a quick exhibition game
nba challenge is where you play against the nba teams according to region
be a legend requires you to create a player and chose some other rookies with terrible skills
street school helps you master tricks and dunks like off the heazy and dunkaliciousin this game you can also play as some oldtime nba stars like majic johnson michael jordan larry bird jerry west moses malone etcthe controls are o to shoot square to crossover triangle to jump or rebound and x to passthe best team combo is tracy mcgrady allen iverson vince carter paul pierce and chris webber
although you can only use three of those five any three will do and dont ask about kobe because he couldnt cross over some shoelacesthe score goes up to  and there is a shot clock
this can be changed if you use pick up game
for tips on this game go to cheatcccomthis game is most definently worth buying
you wont get tired of it reviews before this one  people against one of those is a review from someone who didnt even play the game and one reviewer had a few good points but to rate this game  star
i dont think so i think the majority of  and  stars is the ones you should be readingi have not played the first version of this game and some say vol  is the better game but i am a big michael jordan fan so how could i pass up on this version that has not only michael jordan in it but  michael jordans
one being the current to the release michael playing for the washington wizards the next being the  michael jordan on the legends team and a  rookie micheal jordan that you can unlock to play as by either buying him to unlock or entering a simple cheat code to unlock himthe gameplay is much like nba jam
in particular nba jam  on the ps
its  on  basketball and you have a various selection of courts to choose from as well as a tonne of nba players nba legends and street ballers to choose fromthe control are pretty much the same as nba jam you shoot you pass and you have a turbo button as well as a trick button
but what makes it different to nba jam is that there is  turbo buttons r r l l and depending on which one you use when shooting or passing or dunking will determine what move you pull off
plus you can also use   or all  turbos to do different moves as well
when using the trick button along with no turbo  turbo all turbos your player will do what moves are given to him it might be a crossover dribble a behind the back spin move ankle breaker and so on with shooting it might be a rainbow shot a one handed fade away etc and then the dunks well there is too many dunks to mention them allon the defense end of the court it is much improved over nba jam games as this time you can block or use turbo and block for a better one but if you use two turbo buttons to block you get a super block move where you dont swat it away you just grab it with two hands like a rebound and keep the ballthe modes in the game are exhibition defeat nba stars and become a legend
exhibition speaks for itself the nba mode allows you to take on  teams for a specific region of the nba like east west north east etc you play through  teams to a score of  then you can play a legends team that will also allow you to unlock those  nba legends if you beat themin be a legend mode you play street ball against mostly street ballers there are a few nba players along the way but i am not sure if any of these street ballers are real people made up or just the ea staff members or something
you begin playing in new york playing a few pick up games just to get your reputation up  and as you beat teams you can also choose to recruit someone from the other team if you want to
you eventually unlock tournaments and challenges to play all leading up to taking on dr j and his boys at rucker park
during tournaments you cant recruit players and it works in a way of a playoffs board do determine the winners to the tournament
the challenges are things like playing nba scoring rules only dunks count etcsomething i forgot to mention is there is a thing called the game breaker
when you earn enough gamebreaker points from doing tricks and what not the screen goes blue and you have a chance to hold two turbos and either shoot or dunk to preform a move that will give you one point and take away a point from the other team if it goes inyou can also press select to store the gamebreaker and try to build up another game breaker which will give you a gamebreaker  which allows you to do a move that is unblockable and takes  and gives  points
if dunking it can do a cool  player dunk where one might bounce it off the backboard the next guy grabs it and bounces it off the backboard and then the rd guy slams it home
there are variations of these moves and it depends if all  players are in position to do such a thing other wise it might just be  of them doing itthere is also an option of rewards where you can unlock any of the street ballers nba legends jerseys and created player attribute increases
i wouldnt go wasting your reward points on these things just go play the nba and legend tournament its not hard and if there is something you do want for your created player go to gamefaq dot com and see how to unlock it with a cheat code they are pretty lousy things to waste money on to unlock so save them for attribute points and new moveswell ive been pretty positive so far now onto the consin gamea few times my player got stuck in a defending mode when all i was trying to do was head to the opponents ring to attempt a goal tending which is legal in this game but instead heshe wont move and the computer blows past me for a dunkthe commentary becomes as annoying as some of the music in this game so they where turned off for good after a while and it made the legends mode a bit boring to play after a while as you keep doing the same thing over and over again and by the time i had completed everything i was pretty bored of playing the gamehmmm i think thats it for in game complaints so that wont tip the scales much as this game is still awesome on two or more playersthe rest of my complaints are just with the create a baller
its really limited to what you can create
you start off by choosing man or woman then a face which also determines your skin color that i hate
then you choose hair and like just about every other basketball game you can create a player in there is no long hair i aint no rapper or street thug and i cant understand why long hair is never an option just because its rarely seen in the nba
the closet to it i could find was a mullet so my created player of myself looked more like that star of the show east bound and down
next up is your clothing which is not a choice of top and bottom and accessories its all a predetermined look you have choices of colors for some but the nba jerseys are one color and only the number of the player its designed fori always like to be a chicago bulls jersey with number  but you can only chose  michael jordan jerseys with  on it why couldnt we pick our own numberyou can buy shoes a waste of time and reward points if you ask me then you can select your attributes but dont expect many you get enough to be  point up on each category of shooting dunking etc there is no  pointer option its just part of your shoot attributes
you select a name but you cant select a nickname a nickname can be earned through legends mode but you have no choice what it selects for you i got something like awesome which is something i would never pick and i dont even know if the commentator says that name because i got so sick of him so much he had been turned off forever
plus i hate rap and techno music so all the music in the game is annoying to meoh one more complaint i nearly forgot
unless someone can tell me otherwise there is no way to delete a created player
i made one character and made him too short by accident but you cannot edit his height faceskin color or name again wtf
now i have a created player i made wrong that i am now stuck with having on the game
if there is a way to erase him please let me know but for the time being im saying i dont think there is a way to delete or change itof coarse more features in the game would always have been nice as one of the  star reviewers said there is no dunk contest  point shoot out or anything which i dont think would be any fun in this particular game but it could have used a practice mode which i guess is training school in a way or a  on   on  mode maybe even  on  heck we could be here all day writing down what we wish where in the game but the game is released and finalized now so there is no way of changing it unless a hacker can make a rom or pro action replay cheat to do sooverall been a fun game it got boring in legends mode but still a great and recommendable game for basketball fans but i would recomend skipping the legends tournament and just use the cheats to unlock everyone and all bonus itemsthis game is way better than the originalmuch more features for create player
new movesbetter graphics
new playas
u can do nba challenge or be a legend to unlock all the playas
do pick up game  fun  or  players
the only drawback is u cant put  memory cards in wit diff info and play wit themoh well this game still rocks hardps
its much easyer than other sports games ull love itthis game is pretty good
its deffinetly not as good as nfl street though
in the game you have a very wide selection of nba players from michael jordan to larry bird to shaquille oneil
the graphics are pretty bad to tell you the truth
thats one of the main flaws in the game
i like the idea of be a legend
its cool
the gameplay  is waaaay over the top
none of this stuff is believable
i mean they defy the laws of gravity
its cool and all but completely unrealistic
i would reccomend this game for basketball fans and fans of nfl street
otherwise you may not even want to rent this game
personally though i like this gamenba street volume  is an improvement from the first
for instance in vol theres rockin beats from nellyredmanmc
lyteand manymany more
and the ballers
theres bonfide ludacrisbiggie littlelilbowwownelly and the stlunitics and of coursestrech
not to mentionthe old school ballers like mjwiltscottiebig omagicbird and the star player drj
now the courts
theres the lincoln college court theresjackson park courtthe cagethe rucker park court and plenty more
now lets rate these puppies so we can get finishballers they can really shot some hoopsbeats nellys my favoriteso is redmancourts i like the cage and rucker parkgraphics couldnt get better
almost lifelikeoverall gameplay simply the besti think you should get it while its hot cuz when its gone its gone
byethe new movie looks great the toy is very cool and the first daredevil video game is also quite fun
this game has very good graphics with vibrant colors and detailed backgrounds depicting the streets of hells kitchen
play as daredevil utilizing his super senses radar acrobatic ability billy club and fighting skill to take down enemies ranging from your common thug to bullseye or the kingpin himself
the game will lead players through what is a loose adaptation of the movie story implenting some comic book elements as well
the controls are good and the game is fun
a worthy preview of the movie
i dont know if youre willing ot on it though
its a somewhat short ride and probably suited more to fans of the movie or of daredevil
its a fun game but think before you buyi rate this   starsthis game is just great
the graphics run at  frames per secondwith no slowdown whatsoever
no pop up either
seems like this game is antislowdown
but the graphics have some jaggieskind of like ridge racer v  and th eyre a little cartoony
the sound and controls are greatalthough you cant customize them
you can pull off crazy tricksits really cool
you also get a good sense of speedunlike midnight clubthat runs at  frames
i wish there was more weapons
you have a limited time to use a weapon once you pick it up
i gave it   for the jaggies and limited weapons
but still great game
if your a racing fan buy this
if not rent and buy if you think its worth itwhen you first play rumble racing you will notice that only half the game is available to you
to unlock the meatier cars and tracks you will have to finish the championships
doing this can be very frustrating as the oppenents ai is excelllent
this means that you will be doing the same race for ages not goodthere is also one other tiny flaw within the game and that is the most incredibly annoying commentator in history
when you land a particularly good stunt or blow one of the other cars into the air the commentator will say quotwoah you rawkquot or in the worst possible case quoti bet you feel as happy as a squirrel on a nutfarmquot
this is one thing i hope that ea will rectify for the sequel and the next and the next as is always the case with ea games
overall if you are a racing nut consider this essentialthis truly is ssx with carsif you are looking at this game right now you know that it has come down  dollars in price
let me tell you paying  for this game is worth itthe game play is very addicting fast paced and it being a ps game has fairly fast load timesthe tracks are all fairly original while a few may seem familiar to other tracks
finding the shortcuts in each track is fun and a must to do because the faster the cars go the smarter the ai getsthe best thing about this game is the frame rate
there is no slow down whatsoever on this game
while the background graphics are a little on the weak side you are going too fast to notice it
the cars though look very detailed and the license plate on the car you are diving will put the players name on the back of itthe powerups for the game are incredible
the twister is just a joy to throw if you are sitting in last place
throwing bombs and sonic blasts are a joy to watch
it makes for some spectacular crashesso if your looking for a game thats highly addictive and very unrealisticyou will have chosen the right one
i gave it four stars for lack of background graphicsa pretty interesting arcade style racer with good crashes and nice speeds
if you are a racing fan and have money and you dont know how to spend it consider spending it on thisquotthpsquot for gba is vry awesomelooking that is
the game is similar and in a way not similar to the psone and n versions except some option have been omited skater and park creator and the levels are a bitodd
the graphics are very nice and thats why i gave it an extra star instead of  stars
but the controls are a bit akward and the camera view is a little hard for most quothawkquot fans and nonquothawkquot fans
the lighting needs to be brighter because sometimes you cant even find where your skater is
on top of all the cons thps is very awesome for the gbawell first thing i must say its a skate bored game whats new
well it was the first d gba game to come out good graphics
well like i have said before ive had this game for a while and it was a fun game for the first   weeks but then the novelty wore off cause i beat with all the guys then i tryed to get all the gaps which was really hard cause there every where
and line gaps are really hard to findsoundthe sound is ok its werid trying to make punk sounding on a gba gamegrahpicsare dope like i said d the bestgame playrocks for a few weeks but the down fall of thps is no multiplayerthats why i think you sould buy this game used or wait till thps comes which i think comes out march  and thps has multiplayerbut all around its a ok game i had fun with it till i beat it and now its just sitting in my room and im about to sale it  oh yeah it last a bit longer than most the games on gba i couldnt make up my mind  or  stars its  and a halfthis game was very well made
the angle that you watch your tiny skater is a little aqward though and it is hard to see object that you are aproaching at sometimes
they graphics besides the small skater are extremely good
i guess i cant rip them on the tiny skater part very much because afterall it is a very small screen
if you look carefully you can actually see your skater pulling off the tricks
this game is very cool and an essential buy for a fan of the series
if you are not a fan of the series i recommend that you dont buy this and go borrow your friends or somethingthis game really amazes me
this games graphics are very good the levels look like  version quality but the skaters themselves are d but they dont even have faces and arent that detailed
there are  modes of play career its just like pro skater s career mode except new levels free skate just pick a level and skate to your hearts content sinlge session this is career mode without the level objectives
the game was the first i ever bought for gba its a very well done and fun game
this obviously isnt the best pro skater game and there isnt any multiplayer this is why it got a  one more thing is that you dont get as much feeling of getting big air as you do in the other versions because of the camera angle and distance from your skater but you cant help but smile when you land your first  point trick i did mine on the school levelgraphicsfun factorgameplaycontrol takes some getting used to but once you learn them its as easy and as simple as walking well not reallyvarietyoverallgreat game period
be sure to read my other reviews just click on see more about me by my namethis was one of my first gba games and let me tell ya this is among the best so far
its fun fast and good looking
the graphics are really good for a handheld the sound is fair and most of all its fun
id never expected a skateboarding game to be this good for handheld that is
thps is perfect for trips too and for the people who get carsick like myself dont worry the music is not as annoing as the gbs and gbcs
so youll be assured not to regurgitate for at least an hourthe game itself is awsome you have plenty of skaters to pick from with a large number of levels goals and so on
although not as good as the playstation version ofcourse it is worth the money especially if you like the tony hawks pro skater gamesthis has got to be the best gba launch title everits play controlgraphics and nearly endless trick combonations make up for the games limited selection of levelsthis is one of the best games yet for the gba
the graphics and animation are some of the smoothest and just plain best especially compared to games like dexters deesaster strikesalthough the game has been toned down from the play station and n versions it still retains some really great playabilityi rented this game on a whim and was completely surprised at how hooked i became on it
the game is basically a suped up pokemon game with different classes that do different damage against other classes which have different powers
in this however you have a team that competes and it really helps equip them properly and use different characters in the varying fights
sounded a little boring to me
after a few hours of game play though i really enjoy it
the main thing that i dont like about this game is that when fighting large battles against two other teams of  or more
it takes forever to get through everyones turn
i would definitely try this game out for a weekend
youll be surprisedthe graphics on this cartridge will make your jaw drop and its just a first generation advance title the graphics are so well done it even has night tracks
the controls are simple to master and follow the gran tourismo theme of building up cars and skills
an overload of tracks and cars also add to the game
buy it play it and dont overlook it at the stores because you will be the one missing outi already have my copywhen the game boy advance launched in  it had a batch of great launch games and bad launch games
gt advance racing is in the upper section of the okaygood launch games
while there are a few things that keep it up from being a great racing game buying it up will still warrant you a fun timewhen it comes to gt acr it breaks down to a few things pick a car pick a track win your race and see what you have unlocked
there are three different circuits that climb up in difficulty curves
to unlock each stage in each circuit you must finish in at least rd place
but if you finish in st or nd place you unlock car parts and new cars
you can use car parts to enhance the overall performance of the car you choose
new cars obviously have better stats and better control than the cars you start out with
there are over  cars and numerous car parts to unlock
to save your progress youll need to take down the password it gives youthe pros its a good racing game and is one of the better launch games to play back then
the presentation is solid graphics and music are pretty okaygood and the effects are plentiful so no two cars sound alike
you can link up two gba to take advantage of the  player mode so there is some re playability
lastly its challenging so you will be kept busy for awhilethe cons the graphics and music
while gtac and gta pr feature better graphics and music it is okay at best
the stages have nice backgrounds but are flat so dont expect to see bumps hills or any special effects
the music is pretty good but to really appreciate it youll need headphones as the gba speakers make it sound less than it really is
i guess thats the case when its a launch game though its not a deal breaker
what is almost a deal break is the password system
this game needed a battery to save your progress and the passwords here are long
one wrong character and youll have to start all over againgt advance racing is a good racing game and not bad of a choice when it comes to gaming on the gba
despite its flaws it is still fun to play
its hard to get a copy of this game so unless you come across it and its really cheap get gt advance  or buy the  game compilation that includes    and moto gp where you use motorcycles instead of carsthis game has very good graphics
it is the best handheld racing game on the marketreasons to buy this item good gameplay awesome graphics good cars and tracks to choose fromreasons not to buy this game  letter password to type in everytime you want to load somethingpeople say that the music and screeching noise is annoying but there is an option to turn off the music or to just turn down the volumeto clear all the tracks and bonuses type in the followingvmn t nrr vmrthis is guaranteed to worki hope that this review was helpful to youit is a great game that is fun to play but it only has  minor flaw in my opinion
and then it has a minor minor flaw
the minor flaw is the password thing as opposed to saving your game
the minor minor one is the annoying music
other than that it is really goodcombine half life rogue spear and delta force and youll end up the operation flashpoint
this game is like no otherthe realism is what stands out the most
this game brings you into the world of combat instead of throwing you into a quotget killed restartquot learning method as most games donot to run a spoiler but one of the first missions drops you in a conflict zone for the first time
youre leader is yelling at you the radio is clogged with voices screaming and yelling explosions are going off near and far bullets whizzing by your head and hitting soldiers near youi could go on and on
also the sight of a battle in the distance is remarkable
you could just stand there and watch but another great thingif you dont take cover youre fair game for a sniper no matter where youre standing
take cover
the pace is outstanding and this game is no cakewalk
be prepared to learn how to avoid getting killed even if it means hiding in the bushes for a long time and crawling everywhere via commandosthe reason i gave this game only  stars was the fact that sometimes the game can overwhelm itself
too much going on can tend to lag the system temporarily
im hoping for a new patch
i have a p with  ghz
hard to slow that one downthis is the  game of the year
get use to iti went to the store one day just feeling like buying a computer game
what caught my eye
i soldier with a sniper rifle on the front cover of the operation flashpoint box
i bought it but to my dismay it didnt work on my old comp
so around christmas i bought myself a present
a shining brandnew dell  desktop computer
ofp worked liked a charm on this bad mofo
soon i was emersed for hours at a time in a war fighting for my country against those damn dirty commies
the game is so realistic you wouldnt believe
it even starts you out with boot camp to train you for war
then one night youre shaken awake in your barracks the night before youre going back home after your army reserve training
youre sent out on a mission as a grunt to liberate a town
from this mission on its turned into a full scale war
fighting and fighting
then your squad and its commander go down in a helicopter crash while evacing one of the islands
youre left alone and get picked up by the resistance forces and have to fight with them until the us comes to get you
then you command your own squad on a series of battles
stopping temporarily to play a few missions as the roles of a tank commander helicopter and plane pilot and a specialops soldier called a blackopyou absolutely have to stay with your squad otherwise you will die
one or two shots kill in this game sometimes rarely if youre lucky it will take three shots to kill youyou can put your weapon on your back and even salute or sit down when youre not fighting but just waiting around
the models of the soldiers are amazing
and you dont automatically have binoculars to look through
only the leader of your group does
in some missions a truck has to take you somewhere and you get to sit in the back while someone else drives
there are several single missions as well and plenty to download off of the internet
theres very realistic recoil of the weapons especially the machinegun which is kind of hard to get the hang of with its big recoil
firing from in a bush or something
dont stay there too long or the enemy will see your muzzle flashes and lay down fire on you
get wounded very badly
you cant walk anymore and have to crawl until you find a medic or first aid tentcenter
afraid of the firefight thats getting too intense outside
go hide in a house or shoot out of its windows
the enemies arent idiots in this they actually think
on veteran mode they are crack shots
so watch out
when soldiers are idle you can watch them checking and cleaning thier weapons if theyre sitting
the sound is extremely realistic from explosions and gunshots right down to bugs buzzing and bird chirping
the death animations are kind of lousy though
not enough blood for a huge war like this in my opinion but whatever
theres also a map editor
its very difficult to learn how to use but once you learn how the scenarios you can create are endlessupsidewarning possibly considered the most extremely realistic war game ever
graphics are amazing
sound effects are awesome
map editor provides endless createable missions
several premade single missions
tons of military equipment
and for once you can be a grunt
woot
woo hoo
downsidemultiplayer is iffy
hard to get the hang of some weapons
hard to get the hang of tank command
hard to get the hang of troop command
cheasy death scenes
ie very little blood soldiers dont flinch when theyre woundeddonnydgamereview official reviewerjust after commanding a tank column i snuck into an enemy base and blew up the aa guns
this was so that the next mission i could fly my huey cobra gunship against the ts that were stationed therethis game is completely dynamic
if you fail your missions tough luck cuz the computer will move you to the next mission with those results you can replay them but you lose alot there cuz there are no second chances in combat
as you move through the campaigns there is a campaign editor you may gain rank enough to eventually command your own squad or flight or wahtever is appropriate
and instead of one character you play  or  infantry black ops helo pilot tank commander a pilot i havent done this one yetits a  interactive environment
run over a sapling with a tank and you can hide behind it when you evacuate your burning tank
one mission my black ops character stole an enemy helicopter
the landing was less than perfect but then what did you expectif i had only word to say about it quotbuy
quot  but since i am allowed more than that quotbuy buy buy
quotthis game is good but not as good as counterstrike
the graphics are good as is the sound
the difficulty is bad the enemy is very smart hidding everywhere
that is what makes the game realistics though
single player is fun multiplayer sucks for now few rooms and poor players await you in cyberspace
all in all a good but not great gamewhen judging something one must and can only compare it to what one already knows
opflash it the latest in a growing sub genre of realistic military shooterstratigy games
specops invented it and rainbow six made it popular
what opflash brings to the table is the first real game that simulates war
the small cramped corridors of r are gone
replace by rolling hills and lush forests
the forests are indeed interesting you could walk past an enemy and never know it
and the wide open spaces mean you can be killed at almost any moment
r made action intense with the threat of behind every door death awaits
opflash gives you that threat at every moment as you walk along not knowing if that is a bush or a sniper on the hill
it makes for a much more interesting game and removes the commando mentality
i spent half the fight just hoping the ai would kill each other off
that said the ai lacks real tactics
while this game is full of realistic combat realistic strategy need not apply
forces will run head first in the open for all to see in to a position ware the enemy is well protected
while i might have a machine gunner or a medic what is the point if he just runs in and gets killed fast
shouldnt those types be holding back to support the others
while the ai knows how to shoot and toss grenades it doesnt know much elsealso all the vehicles are drivable
it was a blast to fly the attack choppers
great fun
most of the ground vehicles are not so impressive but hard to beat an empty jeep when you need one
this adds a significant advantage to who ever controls even the lightest tank
as well as adds to the realism as you are dropped off transported and picked up by vehicles
seeing troops jog over bush to a hovering black hawk seems like a scene right out of a war documentary
the theme of opflash is interesting
it is set in  this means that while automatic weapons are common high power automatic assault rifles with ir sniper scopes and silencers are not
it is modern but not hightech old but not ancient
the enemy is armed with much the same things you are you dont have to worry about laser guided automatic grenade launchersthat said much of the combat is at range when the targets you are told to attack are at  feet you do kinda wish for a ir sniper scope
sadly you must make due with what ever rifle you are given
at least you can pick up a different one from fallen friends and foes
the combat is so frantic learn to hug the ground when rounds start popping it can be upsetting that it is not more forgiving
if i fail i must start back ware my last save or retry point was
also you are allowed only one save per mission
so if you get killed by a enemy tank four hundred feet away that you cant destroy is that fun
no
is it real
yes
times like that i wish that was wasnt as much focus on realism and more on plain funother than that opflash is an enjoyable and impressive game to behold
with plenty of good ideas and options to keep the player on edge and entertainedoperation flashpoint is a tactical first person shooter set in a s quotcold war turns hotquot scenario
for those of you not in the know while most first person shooters focus on rambostyle action tactical shooters emphazise realism planning and ussually allow you to control a teamthe plot isnt exactly a novelty a soviet invasion of a small group of islands results in a serious clash between us and russian forces
the story is enough to drive the gameplay however and make you feel you are fighitng for a purposethe game differentiates itself from others in the genre in many ways
to begin with this is the first fps ive seen that attempts to completely simulate combined arms combat with a commitment to militarily accuracy
a complete compliment of s military hardware is featured in the game from abrahams tanks to ah apache longbows to t tanks to a number of accuratley reproduced firearms
the selection is amazing
a large selection of machine guns sub machine guns grenades tanks planes helocopters apcs and even boats are available
each has specific and very different features and specs
you can actually notice accuracy differences between rifles
and you can use all of themthats a big selling point for this game
before battlefield  and other games like it operation flashpoint was perhaps the first game to feature combined arms
so not only is it a first person shooter but its a tank simulator a flight sim and a driving game
and you can use any vehicle in the game
you see a car in a small town  get in a drive
you see a dead enemy soldier with a weapon drop what you got and pick up his instead
you can even get in boats
this kind of freedom is definatley unusualthe landscape and mission paradigm is also free form
you can go anywhere
you are never limited as to where you can go in a mission and you can get in a car and drive miles in the wrong direction if you so choose
you can complete any mission in whatever way you like too  sneak into a town and complete your mission or jump into an empty enemy tank and blow everyone awayrealism is a key emphasis
get shot a few times or once in the head and youre dead
get your legs shot up and you cant run as fast or may have to crawl around
shoot out a tire on a truck and it goes flat
shoot an engine you might disable it completely
you have a compass and map and a watch to tell time and there is a realist time cycle  it will change from day to dusk to night at appropriate times  and there is also weather variations
run too long and you get tired
ive rarely seen such dedication to realism in a gamethis realism extends to graphics and sounds
all vehicles are accuratley rendered both inside and out
you can choose first person or rd person view so you can actually sit inside a tank and look around at the inside
detail is present in graphics  there is even a working speedometer on car dashboards
the use of sprites and less than perfect textures on some objects like houses and fauna limits the eye candy to some degree but otherwise the game looks really good especially for being a  release
sound is great and very realistic
hearing bullets whiz by you or the reverb of a tank shot is enough to convince you that youre actually in dangerthe problems with the game are bugs
motion is can be stuttery at times and occasionally youll get stuck or pass through solid matter  if only the army got ahold of that technology
the controls for the various vehicles can have some issues as flying is a real pain
driving too isnt perfect  ofp is a jack of all trades and a master of none
the realism also makes for a very difficult gaming experience at times
the worst mistake was the choice to limit you to only one save per mission
a huge pain
you will no doubt have to play the same parts of a hard mission over and over and over thanks to this and while it adds to realism players should always be given the option to save more if they choose
this really can hurt the gameplay experience
i often become frustrated with this especially since all it takes is one tiny wrong move to get yourself a in body bagbottom line this was a ground breaking game
if you love detailed realistic games and are a military enthusiast you will have an orgasm playing this game
just be prepared for a first person war simulation  not at all an arcade game
if you just like quick action then you best look somewhere else
this is a great game that needs some polishing hopefully the sequel will address the flaws
i recomend buying the game of the year addition which costs the same and includes all the add ons and expansion packsthis isnt out in the us yet but that doesnt affect me because i live in england
whats the game like
imagine hidden and dangerous with fewer bugs the openair combat of delta force the attention to detail of rainbow six and you have operation flashpoint
it looks stunning  at night you can see the lights of traffic from half a mile away  and it plays differently to any other combat sim youve ever played
for a start you cant fire on the move if youre carrying a hefty rifle so you have to take cover
and when the enemy spot you they shoot at you and if they hit you you are dead
so you have to keep moving from cover to cover
this isnt like delta force where you can stand on a hill and snipe everybody to death  in operation flashpoint if the enemy see you theyll kill you
and they do quite frequently
you can save the game once
its rock hard needless to say and i like that
the openendedness is the other selling point
if you have to blow up some enemy tanks you can plant bombs use a rocket launcher or steal a tank and blaze away with the main gun and once youve done that you can escape by foot or you can steal a truck
its a bit like the old game midwinter but bigger and better
downsides
there are some bugs that crash the game and its not much fun unless you have a fast pc
the manual is dreadful  it tells you the barest minimum but not for example how to accurately throw hand grenades  and there isnt much of a tutorial
unless youre a veteran of rainbow six youll spend a lot of time walking forwards looking left and right and  rattattat  dying from bullets fired by soldiers you never saw
in summary its a goodlooking hectic combat sim which takes realism ie
difficulty to new levels
its miles better than the competition  the delta force games look childish in comparison whilst rogue spear just seems ugly and smallscale  although theres a sense that its close to perfection but not quite there
some of the ai is odd  enemy bmps in particular spend a lot of time spinning around in circles whilst there are a few bugs if you save a game it throws the timing of a mission out of whack and its a bit unforgiving with regards to swap space
but youll be playing it for weeksdont get me wrong this is a very good game but it does contain a few bad points i wont bother mentioning the good points cos youll have heard them all beforethe graphics are good but not upto todays high standards and the fact that the game renders such hugfe areas at a time leads to somr massive loading timesthis is the games main read only problem the loading toimes just dont fit with the gameplay with  a game where the selling point is a real battlefield where one shot can be the end this is frequently it
you can be just staring the level when you are sniped or grenaded and thats it
it would be ok if you could just restart and get bacjk to it but witht he loading times its  mins before youre back out therei suppose this heightens the tension knowing that one hit and youre back to square one but it gets annoying after a while and really hampers the experienceall in all if youve gotr a really really fast pc then this shouldnt be much of a problem but this is a fairly major gripe with the game that yopu should take into account before buyingthis game is not fun enoughyou get tired of it in  daysive rent it and i wasnt pleasedoh and if you play this game your controller is the one getting hurt not the oponentafter playing the demo of this game i can only say that i was very impressed
for a fighting game the graphics were fantastic with djs and cage dancers in the demo level
the characters look great and for the most part the rappers dont disappoint
redman and method man looked good and i am excited about dmx and ludacris
i just wish that all of the rap labels had released artists
wheres dr dre snoop dogg and eminem when you need them
aside from the rappers the other fighters look good
they really look like a gangsta from the depths of the bronx
the sound was good especially the sound effects
the crowd sounds realistic as well do the fighters
the taunts are cool and the moves that each character has are out of this world
if you want bad this game has it all
the levels look good with crawling living city environments
its like a scene out of training day
the interface was good and the controls were comfortable and easy to get used to
the other features and gameplay elements look good as well even though they werent included in the demo version
i have a lot of hope for ea sports big because they have produced such fine games as ssx tricky and street hoops
whos badafter playing the full version of the game i was even more impressed
there are many awesome fighters and even girlfriends which are exactly as they sound
each girlfriend out of the five has the ability to fight and they have pictures featuring real hot real models not animated ones
you choose your girlfriend and you can dump her each time a new one comes along and she fights and stands by your side
the hottest girl is deja by far but that is of course personal opinion
this feature makes the game even more fun than it already is
the levels are awesome but there are just too few of them
multiplayer is great but the single player mode is extrewmely short
i beat it in two short days
djv is great fun for rapper or wrestling fans and it throws out the old wrestling games and brings forth a new style of game
this is the new master of the ps and gamecube ringsthis game is decent but i have seen much better
this is a creative fighterwrestlering game
i do think that it is worthy of purchasing but it is nothing that you have never seen before in any wrestling game
i personally was attracted to the game because i am a real mccoy hiphop fan plus def jam is my favorite rap label
they got the rappers and the gamewordsomehow i adore this game
there are many well known stars like dmx method man joe budden and  nore
there are also created fighters
these fighters are sketch razor chuklez and nyne
my favourit fighters are joe budden and razor
razor is m  tall and he is very strong so his punches look unreal good
def jam vendetta includes no blood and thats awful
every fightingame should have blood
by the way i enjoy def jam vendetta and somehow its amazingdo you like rap music
do you like wrestling games
if you said no to either of the questions stop reading this review and forget about the game
otherwise read onthe game itself has a premise that most people have only dreamed about
take the attitude of the ghetto mix it in with a brawler like smackdown and throw in some rappers to bump up the beat
however dont expect another wwe wannabe
this game holds its own genre
the graphics are great
rarely will you expirience slowdown and the environments and characters cannot be complained about
the contols take on the aproach of n style grapplers and you will learn them fairly easily it takes about  minutesor a few matchesto get used to them
the sounds offer a great showing if you like rap music and the brawlers themselves sound realistic and will make you laugh or growl at what they have to say
even the real rappers sound authentic whether or not they are im really not sureso will you have fun
just remember that this game is fast paced and you gotta have a little bit of time to get used to it
once again if you dont like rap or wrestling this game is nothing spectacular actually now that i think about it this game is more of a one on one fighter then a wrestling gamehmmm
anyway rent this game before purchasethough i bought this game right away and im glad i did especially since i got it before the rating when from t to mthanks for waiting esrb dthis game is great
the graphics are top notch amp the game engine is nd to none
the moves are fluent without glitches
you have a whole cast of colorful charatcers
there are  total
not  like the game ads suggest
the best thing in the game are the finishing moves
i love the slo mo poundings
they are very outragoues amp extreme
getting gfs is nice too the bad parts are tag team matches
awful amp confusing no creating your own charater
bummer lack of modes amp weapons
still its worth the  bucksbut so are youprospretty good graphicsnicely done wrestlingstyle battle systemmusic from all the main def jam artistsome of the blaze finishers are spectaculari get to be some of my favorite rappersdmx ludacris mefredgreat voice actingdespite some voices arent in for longnice setups for devistating combosea big has created another masterpiece with the help of def jamconsyou dont have any weapons to usewheres the create a fighter modegames too shortbeat it in just  dayswheres jayzso i can kick his copying ja ruleso i can kick his fake  freeway beanie seigl slick rick and ll cool j
that wouldave made the game a lot bettergetting revenge for artist who made me waste my money and more artist whom i appreciate and longerthis game definitly made me forget about smackdown real fast
despite the cons this game definitly will please fans of wrestling and all of def jams fans as well
so if you are fans of either this should be in your collection of ps gamesor gamecube gamesfinal wordsthis game was superb no doubt but i just hope that if they make a sequel to this lets just hope all of the problems this game has will definitly be tweaked so everyone can enjoy a much better and longer gamepeacethis game is one of the best wrestling games availible
it features famous rappers such as ludacris and dmx
its pretty easy to pick up the controls and delivers a good dose of action
the only complaints are the lack of modes out of ring weapons amp createawrestler
its a great game for what it does have but it could have had more stuff
maybe next year
still reccomendedthis is one of the best arcade wrestling games that i have played
one of its major flaws is that the entire campaign spanning four players is relatively short maybe about thirty hours
the control is better than most but the focus control in tag team is a wee bit awkward
the likeness of the hiphop artists is down to the mark and the character models are excellent
even much more the arenas are done well and they are animated
the storyline is not boring but its the same for all four players
what makes this game even more entertaining are the finishing moves
some of the finishing moves that i have seen are a tribute to the current wwe stars
for example moses performs a tombstone like the oldschool undertaker
additionally spider does a modified version of the rock bottom
lastly  omar does a version of undertakers last ride
overall this game is definitely a keeper
the extras count a millionwith the photographs of the fly honeys that you obtain
i realise that ea big is creating a second one and please have deja and her gorgeous pictures return in the second one with newer photographs of course
the cons of this game are few
first you cant create a wrestler
second there are no modified matches from the tables ladders and chairs match to the cage match
lastly there is no use of external weapons like pipes or even the audience
but this game is definitely fun with your friends real or imaginarythe return of wrestlings best game developer
the emergence of a wrestling game without the burden of wwe
eas decision to take a little risk
the convergence of all this is def jam vendetta a game that is at once the best wrestling game in years an awesome showcase for some  good hiphop and an example of what can happen when a game company takes a chancevendetta casts you as a street fighter in the inner city where brawlers clash for cash groupies and bragging rights
dmob the fictional leader of the underground has assembled some of def jam records most popular artists to rule the ring on his behalf and you have to beat them down to reach the top
along the way youll get involved in some tagteam drama and girlfriend trauma unlocking playable characters outfits and galleries as you go
djv speaks to a problem in the wrestling genrethe whole thing has gotten stale and its time for some new blood
ea snagged aki developer of the awesome n wcwwwf titles to make def jam a contender
the result is a wrestling game thats fun exciting and imminently playableone that makes the most recent wwe games look like patty cake in comparison
style is a huge part of why vendetta succeeds
the characters arenas moves and taunts all invoke an urban feel that screams def jam while proving that you dont need yj and the rock to make a compelling brawler
tracks from def jams stable of artists pound all over the game and though they repeat a bit too much its nice to have great music playing during a beatdown
djvs other high point is the way it plays
strikes grapples and reversals seem perfectly balanced and easy to do and every match is exciting and gripping
whats more the matches seem to make sensequick series of moves will wear a guy down but give him a chance to rest and hes back almost as good as new
the games ai
is cheap to say the least theres one throw thats reversed  percent of the time by computercontrolled opponents but multiplayer is a blastfinally a wrestling game that doesnt require a wwe fan club membership to enjoy
if you like hiphop brawling or just good games go get vendetta nowvery fun challenging and often hectic
this is twisted metal blackthe best one yet of the series
impressive graphics and gameplay
but suppossedly theyre coming out with an online version soon so you might want to save your money for thatlet me start out by stating that this games presentation is almost flawless
it utilizes a creative d main menu and the graphics are superb
the best part is how weapons fold out of the cars seamlessly instead of just coming out of nowhere on each vehicle like in most car combat games
as for the muchhyped dark theme of the game evident in the cutscenes youll either love it or hate it but there isnt too much mrated material in the gameplay itselfthat said there are  things that make or break car combat games for me special weapons and level interactivity
while tmb delivers in these categories it just doesnt measure up to the king of car combat vigilante  nd offense
many of the specials are very cool like the preachers suicide bomber weapon or sweet tooths infamous ice cream truck mech but they just dont measure up to the ingenuity of vs specials
also while the levels in this game are massive and hide many secrets they arent as interactive as the ones in v where you can blow up andor interact with literally every object in every leveloverall if you are a car combat fan and dont mind gratuitous violence buy this game or the much funner twisted metal black online if your ps has internet access
but if you want the ultimate car combat game get nd offensewith twisted metal on the horizon for the ps i thought id revisit twisted metal black for the ps and give my honest opinion on it
as most of you knowwhove read my reviews anyways ive been a twisted metal fan since the early days of the psone
ive owned practically every game at some point and have loved every single onegiven that twisted metal developed by  studiostarnished the twisted metal name somewhat incognito entertainmentnow called eat sleep play decided to bring twisted metal back in style for the ps
thing is twisted metal black bears no resemblance to the games that have come before it
except for the core gameplay and the characters returning twisted metalblack is a darker more violent beast
i have to say this new beast intrigues me
however if youre coming into black expecting it to be a walk in the park wellmy friend youre going to be unpleasantly surprised
things have changed drastically in the tm universe
the levels you battle in are massive the game is faster and more responsive
yet the game is hard as nails at timesoverall twisted metalblack delivers everything youd expect and then somethis game would have been rated   stars if it were possible
just wanted to get that said
i had never really played a twisted metal title until i picked up tmbmy decision to purchase the game before ever playing it was based on the incredible previews i had been seeing ever since the game was announced
the dark gruesome atmosphere definitely piqued my interest and any game that purports to push the power of the playstation  has got to be a winnerif it succeeds
tmb does not disappointits gruesome alright
as a mature gamer lets just say that i remember the days of the sears tv game and the magnavox odyssey i thinks its great that sony is willing to market a game that nintendo wouldnt touch with a  foot pole because of its disturbing content
were talking scenes that would be trimmed from an rrated horror movie
a lot of them were definitely inspired by the xfiles and movies like seen and the silence of the lambs and are decidedly not for kids
but those are just the story scenes and character intros
the game itself is violent but not graphically so
there are some piercing screams when an opponent or a player is destroyed and the driver of the vehicle goes running off engulfed in flamesbut hey this is just a game after allthe graphics are sharp and the framerate is smooth and consistent at  fps
there is a tad bit of slowdown in the splitscreen mode but its hardly noticeable
the cars are wonderfully designed and show lots of clever details
switching weapons is fun just to watch the car metamorphose as the new weapon is readied for use
the control is literally perfect for the gameplayintuitive and responsive and variable depending on the stats of the vehicle being controlled
the only control gripe i have is that the twisted metal series are the only carbased games that dont use the x button as the accelerator
enemy ai is spoton and vehicle physics while absolutely unrealistic are perfectly suited to gameplay as well
environments range from quotmassivequot to quotvery smallquot and are all amazingly detailed and enhance enjoyment of the game
sound is great from the aforementioned tortured screams of defeat to explosions and shrieking missiles
the ingame music is the best ive ever heard
all the tunes are gothic classical and heavy metalindustrial takes on the theme of the rolling stones quotpaint it blackquot
very original concept for a video game and it really adds to the dark atmosphereeverything about twisted metal black is impressive
any mature gamer owes it to himherself to check out this game asapfirst of all a  year old gamer is nothing more then an ea rep notice how he pitched an ad for ea games most reviewers and players would agree that tw  and  were both failures due to eas size however they are able to manipulate the buyer
dont pay attention to his ad pitch you have been warned
try tw  or  or black as all three are better then  and now that the stupid people have been killed lets move on to the reviewfirst of all this game is gorgeous the sound effects are bustling and the story is alot better then most tms
its only failure is its mediocre ai mediocre level design and less expansive levels actually they are bigger but in tw you could cover the entirety of paris which makes for far greater battles even though the actual area is smaller then most black levels but its the thought that counts
also it seems like there werent enough big things happening instead of knocking down the eiffel tower your destroying a carnival wheel
the characters abilities and specials arent as detailed and for the most part this game gets dull quick alone however online play and p save this game and make it worth having and yes the game is still somewhat fun on single playerthis game is super mega crazy hard
you basically have to start on easy mode since normal mode is intense since every car you fight with all attack you instead of a free for all frenzy like i was expecting
however this game is definetly more enjoyable with friends
the story is not bad but the campaign can get challenging
if that is not a problem then you will have a lot of fun with thisits one of the best tmb ever i admit that but it is also bad
you see if you select a character you go through stages
you now shoot cars kill cars run into cars etc but the more weirder part is that you see these gross movies of people socking a person with a scissored glovedarm bloodymary stabbing people cannibals and more
the game is great at first
blow up houses run over people make a ferris wheel run down but i got bored after a week
you see after a while you realize its almost like playing a   d game
if you fall and land on you rtop it juxt fips back and it doesnt look real either
so dont go buying it for your kid its goryduh thats why its maturethis game is graphically pleasing
the explosions and the cars are very nice
the dementia of the patients notice i said patients not characters is interesting as well
however  if you intend to play this game make sure you first set it on easy in the options mode and then proceed to learn all of the quick codes for freeze and mega guns
this will curve some of your frustrationthen if you are still having trouble put in some infinite ammo codes
this will level the playing field a bit
im not joking here
a challenge is nice but not a mass murder of player  it took me about  times to advance to the second level then out of breath saved it
it took me a whole week to get through the nd level
i am still on the rd level
i thought this was supposed to be easy mode
and the guy that says we are whining  i dont know what your problem is but i have been a twisted metal player since  i cruised in crimson fury defeated dark tooth and got the medium sized tmiii tshirt from toysrus with preorder before the turn of the millenium
i have played the games and beat them over and over again
i would consider myself very good at the series
but this game is fricken hard
someone mentioned bosses
i can only imagine how that would govery entertaining game but extremely frustrating at the same time
super super super hard
put in the codes
do not believe those that say it is easy it is not a walk in the park and is barely enjoyabletwisted metal blackafter a long hiatus aftertwisted metal  the original developers return to the twisted metal franchise
many people claimtwisted metal  and were dark spots on the series that are better left alone
twisted metals first outing on the playstation  would lead to the best twisted metal game to be produced to date
there is another version of this game known as twisted metal online
it is the same game except with online capabilitiesgraphics when you first bought your playstation  this was one of the games to pick up
it came out early in the cycle so graphics had not been perfected yet
this is an extreme update from the previous playstation  titles
ingame graphics looks fantastic
there is nothing like watch sweet tooth transform into an erect machine of destruction
cut scenes are all very well done
the graphics will probably be considered subpar now but at the time they were great
the way the cutscenes are designed is perfect
while many cutscenes are similar due to the layout of the story they work out fantasticlevel design has improved vastly
not only are the levels larger but they are more interactive
one level starts you on a prison boat
the level seems a bit mediocre with not much about it
than the ship hits land and you can shift in and out of the boat
this uniqueness makes for a very fun play
other levels include highways rooftops and general town areas
each one plays differently and provides a different feelcharacter vehicles are designed well
no vehicle looks similar to another
this game features the return of favorites like darkside axel sweet tooth spectre and others
new characters like crazy  will quickly warm up to you
all the vehicles are assumed to be stolen other than a few from the asylum which most of the characters are from
therefore they look run down and trashy
this is goes good with the dark vibe this game presentsstory like other twisted metal games calypso is holding a vehicularcombat tournament
the winner will receive one wish
while many characters carry over in name they are not the same characters as previous games
this time they are actually better though
you will become attached to each characters story and want to hear their stories
i think the only returning characters are sweet tooth and minionto better flesh out what you can expect from this game i want to tell you the beginning of darksides story
a young woman darkside is a woman in this game by the way begins working for a mask maker
she is just a secretary
one day while doing paperwork she spills coffee on everything
her boss is enraged and decides to make a special mask for his clumsy worker
he makes a full head mask that looks like a doll face
he than nails it into the workers head
yeah what is wrong with this guy
he than secures it with a oneofakind key
darkside is put in an asylum due to depression
one day she has a visitor
calypso
he offers her a chance to participate in the tournament
her wish is to escape the mask that has trapped her all these years
it only gets better through the rest of the gamemost characters stories run a similar path
calypso discovers them and offers a chance to take part in the tournament
midway through the game you are revealed more about their past
once you have beaten the game you see them making their wish
most characters have three cutscenes
they usually play out the exact same way just with a different storysound paint it black by the rolling stones is the theme song
that almost sums up all my feelings about blacks sound
i will say that without that song this game would not be the same
the opening menu features this song and sets the dark vibe that makes me love this game
paint it black also plays during the credits and other various parts of blackthe rest of the sound is decent
the level that featured the prison ship features perfects sounds of waves crashing against the boat
there is wind and other assorted sounds that create a fantastic vibe
buildings crashing people dying and guns blazing are just some of the cool sounds you will hear in blackthe music for the rest of the game is solid
nothing really stands out but it will match the level
usually the music is quiet but that works for this title
voice acting is also fantastic
again this creates the perfect vibegameplay the gameplay is exactly like previous installments in the series
you choose a vehicle and you enter a level
you will have to destroy all other automobiles in the level to advance
this is done by ramming them shooting them or pushing them off the level in certain stages
in one player this is enjoyable
it works as a fun break from other video games
you can either play through the story mode we discussed earlier or just play a round on a chosen levelmultiplayer is fun as well
you can have up to four players on one game
the objective is the same
you must kill all other players to win the round
you can also play story mode together
only player one will have his story told but it is just another fun multiplayer optionthe addition of secret characters and items increases the drive to replay this game
since the stories are essential in this game having more characters will quench your thirst
the addition of new levels will increase the fun in multiplayer
these secrets are not the complicated to discover but are fun searching fordifficulty  note this is how much i like the difficultyblack is an easy game to pick up and play
story mode itself is pretty easy
this is how black needs to be though
you want to hear each characters story so badly the gameplay should not interfere with that
however not anyone can pick up and start winning
more experienced players will know the layout of the level better and have the advantage
new players do have a decent chance of winning thoughoverall i recently reviewvigilante  nd offense
in the review i assured every one that black is a much better choice
this is why
black has dark stories that are very deep despite only lasting three cutscenes each
black has better levels and graphics
black is just better
that is not just in comparison to vigilante  but all carbased combat games
if vehicular mayhem is your cup of tea buy this one right nowthis is a great game and the graphics are good but the maps welli dont like
every one of them is placed at night of in the evning so at some times its hard to see other than that the game is really goodi originally reviewed this when i was a few years younger so the review didnt look very wellwritten at all
my comments are still the same however
if you liked the other twisted metal games you will likely enjoy this one
lack of online play and a bit of a difficulty imbalance are the only things really keeping this from being a star game in my eyes
the controls are a bit difficult to get used to in terms of using them with finesse at least
one of the boss fights is nearly infuriating with difficulty while the last boss of the game seems a bit too easy in comparisonjudging by current standards on the brink of the next generation consoles becoming the standard it is hard to rate it based on technological standpoints but in its time it was superior
in addition the style of the storyline is very interesting and worth looking at
i played through god of war and in some ways one of the cutscenes from god of war reminded me of the style used in this gameso ultimately if you like the style of game definitely get it
if you dont like the gameplay typically you wont like this one as it has a similar feel to the others in the series
however this is not a mustbuy by any means in my opinion
i could have lived without it despite it being a star game qualitywisesomehow i think this is how twisted metal was meant to be all along
this game is dark violent and probably the best desturtion derby type game for the ps
all the characters are escapees from an insane asylum and of course calypso is there to grant their fondest wish usually for revenge provided they kill everyone else in car combat in a variety of arenas city drivein theater mountain pass etc
the video sequencesstorylines are gory violent and some of them are truly horrific mr grimms is particulary nasty
take the quotmaturequot rating seriouslythis is a great game for teens and they really like the role playing in the game
not easily beaten though
one on one up to four players with extension modulei have to say i was suprised to see how great this game was when it came out on ps
i thought it wasnt going to be that good but it proved me wrong
first of all this game has a lot better graphics than the previous twisted metals
it also has an awesome dark score to keep you interested instead of annoying background music
secondly this is a lot more challenging
the enemies remain challenging and are never impossible to beat
the only tough enemies are the bosses and i find the bosses very challenging
the other amazing upgrade to this game are the interactive battlegrounds
unlike all the other twisted metals if you went in to get health in a small area and stayed there the walls wouldnt slam into each other and crush you
but in this one there are tons of traps
also you can shoot down planes and get health from helicopters
now heres the reason i gave this game  stars
this game is awesome dont get me wrong but the only bad thing is the health
when you are about to die and succesfully dodge all those enemies that are chasing after you your already dead
then when you finaly get health you dont gain alot of it
thats like the only bad thing about the game and thats why i give it  stars
if you like twisted metal and have a ps then i say get twisted metal black because this game has alot of other new features than the previous
enjoy the challengethe first impression i had of this game wasnt very good
the graphics looked subpar and i couldnt hit anything
i just started and got creamed in the first level
the learning curve of such of game was too intense
car combat is so simple why should it take a while to get used to it
anyway with no advancement and no visual aesthetics i quickly dismissed this gamefortunately i came back to it
i grew accustomed to the drab gray graphics i figured out some strategy and i switched the difficulty to easy
what happened amazed me
this game which i thought was terrible turned out to be pretty goodyou get to choose between around  different characters
each character pretty much goes through the same levels so once youve been through a few characters youve seen all the levels in the game
each character controls another car and more importantly gives you a cool movie describing his or her ordealthese movies are what make the game
though very very short nothing close to final fantasy x these little second clips are disturbing intense dark and simply amazing
the credits with a montage of the various cut scenes played to rolling stones fade to black is worth the price of this relatively inexpensive game aloneeven though the graphics could have been better and the game easier playing a few characters is worth it
though i would love to see all the movies the game gets pretty repetitive
despite these flaws i recommend this gameprosmoviesending creditsinteresting gameplayinteresting charactersdifficulty levelssimple gameconstoo gray and drabtakes forever to kill a vehicleinitial learning curvenot enough levels  repetitivehours to complete  hours for the first character  hours for additional characters  characters totaldifficulty medium for easy levelfrustration medium mostly from the beginningnot a bad game to kick back and play once in a while
still doesnt beat the original but still is very enjoyable to playlets start off with the graphicsthe missiles and explosions on the cars are unmatched by any other ps game out thereand the cars and buildings make the game very realisticthe gameplay is fun but like many other people may agree it is very dark and definitely deserves a mature ratingthe story mode is fun but does get boring at timesi have to say that the best part in this game would be the multiplayer games so if you liked the other twisted metal games for ps and you have a psthen you must buy this gamebut if not then i advise you to rent this game and get to know it before purchasingif you ever plan on playing anything multiplayer on your gba you must consider buying this item
although you need  for a  plrgame  for a  player and  for a  player game it is still must have
the multiplayer feature of the game boy advance is one of nintendos biggest prides
it is greatly improved from the gbc days as you can now play  player
as some other guy said tahe third party cables may be better but just get onei like to play animal crossing and you need this to expand your game so you can get to the islandand thats really all that matters
i was not expecting any packaging or documentation and i didnt get any
what i got was actually branded nintendo and that was something that i was hoping for but not counting on
my son and i can now trade between our gen  pokemon games and thats what we wantedthe game boy link cable is a must for anyone that wants to play multiplayer games on game boy advance
this cable is made by nintendo who has a reputation of genarally making highquality productsthis cable is a fairly good length and allows you to hook up another cable to it through a box in the middle of the cable for player games and you can hook another cable up to the second one for a total of playersthe only disadvantage is that this cable will only connect two game boy advances
that means if you want to connect a game boygame boy pocketgame boy color to another one or to a game boy advance you will need a nintendo universal link cable which is only a few dollars morein summary if just want to connect your gba with another one or  or  then this is perfect for you
if you want to use an older game boy get a universal cableits been a while since ive played a good handheld game because i havent moved on to the ds and psp era yet
aside from games like wario ware and sonic advance for my gba there isnt a whole lot else to talk about especially the craptastic larry boy game
the story is about spidermans aunt may being kidnapped by his six worst enemies so he must go out and save her
this game is basically a sidescrolling brawler but with some extra flavor to add to the gameplay
the webslinging mechanic works surprisingly well and is a lot of fun to use
the fighting works well and is fast and fluid along with the framerate
the graphics remind me of an old nes game but in a good way and its very bright and colorful and detailed
i must admit the levels are odd though like where you fight enemies at a carnival and then another at a police station just to name a couple
also the carnival level is even more bizarre over the fact you fight people dressed as clowns or are in bear costumes
the game has interesting puzzles and little passageways that keep things interesting and get you keep playing
there are flaws though
the game is basically a buttonmasher sometimes some platforms are tricky to swing to and it does get a little boring but luckily that rarely occurs
i enjoyed my experience from playing this game and i give it thumbs up for packing quite a punch for an old handheld game
if you like spiderman youll enjoy this gameothers have said this is a rental only titlerent it
i wouldnt dream of just renting a rare classic when i can buy it at a fair price
im an avid lightgunner so im a bit biased but this is nearly as good as house of the dead  but it is a bit short in length thus i subtracted a star from my score
of course you need a light gun to fully enjoy these kinds of games
the ultimate setup is  light guns either for dualfisted fun by yourself or to have a friend over and play side by side
mad catz makes the best gun and theyre reasonably priced right now
get em while you can folks
these are great games on a great system
sure to be collectibles someday if not already
those of you whove returned your copies of this game and feel triumphant will someday regret your decision when you feel the urge to play again someday and find youll have to pay twice as much a year or two down the road
the graphics are very nice the acting is cheezy as it should be the lightgun gameplay is fantastic and the framerates are smooth
what more could ya wantconfidential mission is a very fun game though i never got the chance to play it at the arcade so when i saw it for  bucks i bought it
what i got is a really good game but it is very short only three missions
its worth the price and its a good bit of fun and the extra modes add replay valuethis is essentially a dreamcastquality virtua cop semisequel
the graphics are very nice designed for the getgo for high resolution rather than just quotrevisedquot from low resolution as virtua cop  was available as part of the sega smash pack
this is evidenced in everything from the smooth detailed text to the character models and texturesthe game is also very fun with a pleasantly cheesy sense of humour from the james bondlike smartarse you play and hear from
the voices are actually decent unlike the awful zombie revenge voicesthere are only  levels available in an original and mixed locations mode with branching paths available
youll know when the branches arrive as the game will present a unique dilemma and weapon to use for a specific task
fail and you get a tougher pathi managed to finish the game a couple times on normal with the standard dreamcast pad opening up a mission select but apparently ill need to do better in scoringuse of credits to open the mixed modebe aware that that may indeed need a lightgun or mouse unless auto reload or a larger sight is used in the options
i wouldnt consider that quotcheatingquot if one chooses to stick with the regular controller
to finish some of the expert minichallenges for instance i may have to hit those options myselfif you dont already own it id recommend that you get alpha centauri instead of this game
i like this game but alpha was definitly better
basically this game is alpha centauri with different names and pictures
of course since its ac its a good game but the difference is that alpha centauri  is ten dollars and can be bought at any store whereas this is  dollars for the same game
also alpha centauri is much less of a hard drive hog than this game
alpha centauri also had a primative multiplayer whereas this game offers no multiplayer and just the tenuous possibility of an expansion pack for another  dollars of course
as a side note both games have a heavy learning curve
id recommend that you get a friend who knows how to play to consult if you can find one when you try to learn this game or ac the games have pretty much identical gameplay
so basically this is a great game but you can get a better game for less by buying alpha centauribeing a huge rts fan and starcraft being my all time favotite i wasnt sure if this game would live up to all the hype
it would take one heck of a turn based strategy game to keep my interest
i played alpha centauri and its upgrade and while amused i got bored of it after a while
when i got civ  i started by playing the tutorial
it was real fun
i then launched into the game itself
im very impressed with the details of the game there is a lot to manage without being too overkill
the game overall is very engrossing and i really have to fight to turn it off to go to bed
the graphics are nice much nicer that alpha centauri and the flow of the game really keeps you involved
it took a while to learn how to pump out the modern weapons but i finally did it
one drawback is the waiting between rounds later in the game
they show every workers movement and every enemys movement in your range of sight
this slows the game to a crawl
also when you get an upgrade for aquaduct or hospital the computer proceeds to inform you which cities need that upgrade
this is a hassle when you have thirty cities
the only other bad thing is that the battles arent always so fair
my panzer should be able to walk over a knight and yet the knight can actually do a fair amount of damage and i dont see how a frigate could ever hurt a battleship
a battleship can toast a target  miles away
nevertheless i have enjoyed playing this game which says a lot being one who normally stays away from turn based gameswhen it comes to entertainment im a bloodandguts kind of guyand video games are no exception
but the first game in my alphabetized library is not halflife or max payne
since i enjoy epic games as much as shooters i bought and played civilization iii the latest in sid meiers brilliant worldstrategy series
not exactly a sequel i find civilization iii a polished and streamlined remake of its predecessorwhat do i mean by remake
well first lets take a look at the series
the original civilization put the player at the head of a human precivilization
his or her job was to lead the people into recorded history across  years to the present
the player could choose governments build a war machine control emigration and develop science
back in my day civilization ii ruled the roost of intellectual strategy games mainly because my computer could run it
but it also expanded greatly upon the original game by increasing the types of units and concepts by improving the existing units and concepts and by adding various editor programs and expansions
after civ ii activision developed a separate seriescall to power
ctp added an entire future age complete with a story and timeline
in other words civ ii and ctp came that much closer to being epic and diverse
civilization iii does not step forward it runs in place and shows off its muscles
and i have to admit this game looks and plays pretty good
civ iii initially loads a bit slowly on my  ghz and my mb
ingame reloading is quick and animation is generally smooth
the graphics easily surpass the previous titles and includes unit animation as in the call to power offshoot
looking at the map window is like looking at a real satellite image and the terrain tiles blend together
i cant complain about the interface the multiple menus of civ ii have folded into a single screen here
handy buttons allow all unit commands to be quickly and easily issued by pointandclick only the appropriate buttons will appear for each individual unit
i can complain that even on my gaming platform civ iii crashed several times particularly when i was using catapults to bombard a rival citythe programmers at firaxis dont bombard the player with features either
the watchword around the office must have been slim and sexy
homogenizing the menus and adding a unit orders panel seems to have led to a complete revamp of the previous sop
trade no longer depends on special units instead it is handled through the diplomacy screen
diplomacy is accessed directly from buttons on the main map screen
speaking of diplomacy embassies and spies are also handled by buttons instead of units
military units also no longer consume resources from individual cities instead they simply cost gold from the national treasury
by the way the player must now take extra caution when choosing city locationsterraforming doesnt exist in civ iii
finally the numbers of civilizations government types and victory time limits have been reducedall the reductions and subtractions do not allow this game to step forward at least when compared to the considerably longer and more developed call to power
but firaxis doesnt let civ iii step back either
many important additions make civilization iii relatively dynamic and the most important to me is the concept of culture
previous games lacked political boundaries which meant the players civilization was always a collection of citystates
any rival civilization could walk right in and start planting its own cities
in civ iii your cities still claim personal resource squares but they also generate a culture influence
each citys culture grows if the right improvements are built
the areas of influence not only overlap to claim an entire mass of land and sea but neighboring cities may defect if their own culture is too weak to resist
along with the concept of culture is the concept of strategic resources which are needed to build certain units and improvements
civilizations will automatically collect any resources falling within the culture boundary provided said resource is connected by road or railit may seem to the reader by now that civilization iii is more realistic than its ancestors
many of the changes and eliminations have been balanced out by concepts such as culture and strategic resources
the manual explains most of the revisions and additionsand yet the world of civilization ii remains
from the graphics to the game play civilization ii is polished and revised to make this current incarnation
i was a bit disappointed at first when i realized that so many concepts and units were cut back
but once i realized civ iiis place as a classic remake i relaxed and just played the game
for a shootemup guy like me thats pretty civilok  i admit it  im a quotsimquot game addict
ive played previous versions of civilization and many other world building style games and this one takes the current crownthis game is a lot like its predecessors
you take the position of the leader of a great civilization and must build your nation into a true world power
from its tiny beginnings as a single village watch where you build your first city
to a true world power you are in control
you can discover new areas of the world build your cities and infrastructure like farming and mining to name two examples and strike out to explore new areas of the world  all at the same timethe new national leaders are much more interesting
do you want to conquer and explore or are you more interested in a scientific approach
do you want to enter the space race or just stay on terra firma
note that the computer controlled characters have the same goals as the ones you can choose at the beginning of the game
you can use this info to decide if you want to trade discoveries or fight your neighborsthe new unit hit point display allows you to see if your units are damaged and by how much
i really appreciated this feature
the graphics are much improved over older editions
the other leaders seem much more intuitive and really give you a challenge especially early in the game
even if you want to discover and explore you will sooner or later run into another nation thats more interested in killing you and taking what youve worked so long to build away from you
thats where things get interestingbtw theres a new add on pack that adds believe it or not even more world leaders to choose from even more discoveries to make and even more challenges for you to take on
try looking for the quotconquestquot expansion pack and really have the best of the best
this particular version of civ does not include the quotplay the worldquot expansion but the quotplay the worldquot expansion is included on the quotconquestsquot expansion discof the world building games civilization has long held the crown of leader of the pack
this great new version of the game regains that crown for sid meier
if you play games like settlers pharaoh caesar iii tropico and older versions of civilization you owe it to yourself to check out this great new version
highly recommended for quotsimquot fans and recommended for anyone who wants to see what it would be like to own the worldthis is a great game in the civilization series but it is not as good as civilization sid meier does it again
this is another great civilization to continue the great series
there are many new features that make this better then the previous versions
the future feature is really cool
you can make tactical nukes and tanks and other weapons of mass destruction
the only downside to this game is the fact that its really hard sometimes to take over empires
you have to have a lot of soldiers to take over something
plus a simple barbarian with a stone hammer can beat a super tank with one hit
other then that this game is really fun and addicting
if you liked the other civilizations you wont be disappointedcivilization is my alltime favorite strategy game and it is very addictive
the game looks complicated at first but once you get into it you wont want to stopsure your main objective is to become the sole civilization and rule the world
but theres much more that that
you must make your empire stronger by building cities making alliances with other civilizations and of course crushing the weak civilizationsmy favorite part of the game is the ability to discover new buildingunits by developing research
you can also build wonders of the world which adds bonuses to your city civilization or even the whole worldsid meier is a very good programmer and this promises to be the best civilization and possibly the best strategy game ever made for a pca few crashes a little buggy and espionage is harder than any other version of this gamebut im still addicted
the play is smoother and the automatic upgrades of some of the soldiersworkers is good
i dont miss any of the event movies or other bricabrac that i used to turn off on the gamenot a bad purchase civilization was one of the penultimate computer games and instantly became a success upon its release in   followed by a sequel in  and some pseudociv knockoffs call to power and sid meiers quotcontinuationquot of the theme in alpha centauri it was only a matter of time before the original source material got another facelift
the results of that effort are here in the sumptuously redone civilization of course the graphics and sound have gotten a total facelift and there have been many minor and a few major changes to the game itself
the core is still the same old civ you start off knowing how to make fire and not much else and you take your tribe all the way to colonizing another planet or killing everyone else on the map
the changes are at first glance merely cosmetic units take damage with quothit pointsquot like alpha centauri there are slightly fewer technologies and you arent so restricted in learning them and there is much less emphasis on bulldozing every forest in sight to make farmland
diplomacy has been vastly expanded and instead of building trade caravans you can now connect your civilization to others with roads railroads and harborsthe single largest change is the addition of resources and luxuries even if you discover gunpowder you cannot build musketmen unless you have saltpeter somewhere in your civilizations sphere of control and you have mined or or tapped it with roads
same with luxuries if you do not connect a frontier city to your main civs network of roads they do not have the benefit of resources or luxuries and can easily slip into civil disorder
the other major change is culture building temples and libraries and wonders used to only give you the benefit of increased research or happiness
now it allows you to expand your cultural influence
if you have a city where people have been worshipping at the same temple for thousands of years and your opponent builds a city closeby there is a good chance the people in that city will quotdefectquot to the culturally superior civilization
culture also defines your borders and measures the influence of your cities on other civs and each otherthere is little to complain about here meier left the superstructure of his old game intact if it aint broke dont fix it
 and the additions compliment the game nicely
the only true point of contention is that the government system is still incredibly dumbeddown in fact you have less of a choice about government in this game than you did in civ   if there is one thing i wish that meier would expand on this would be it
also theres no multiplayer support although we have been promised multiplayer in the future but thats not a big deal the way i play the game it takes an average of  hours to complete and i cannot imagine waiting for  other palyers to do the same
civ isnt a game thats really conducive to multiplayer anyway so its not a big loss  remember multiplayer does not a good game makeciv  is a great redux of the granddaddy of all computer strategy games
if youre tired of realtime quotstrategyquot where you see how many units you can build in  minutes take a break and create an empire
its more rewarding anywayid like to address the negative reviews ive read of civ in this forum
its obvious theres a huge range of reactions
i disagree with anyone who gave this game less than a four since i think its a huge improvement over civ
from the comments of reviewers who gave this game three or less stars i can see that they didnt have a grasp of how to play or what was really happening with the game
also ive been laughing my head off at people complaining about greek aircraft carries blowing up their simple galleysfirst my gaming experience ive beaten the game a couple times now at monarch level but havent yet conquered emperor
the game is hard and this contributes to the entertainment ive reaped from the game
the ais are very aggressive which means you must maintain adequate defenses as a deterrent to war
if you do not have defenses andor response teams the ais will realize war with you will be profitable and they will attackon higher levels the computers are cheating which means that instead of following the exact rules a human must for production and development they are skipping steps
the only way to combat this is by using brainborne strategies the ais are currently incapable of developing
here are a few such tactics surprise attack
the ais arent very good at detecting or executing suprise attacks
you can qeue up a huge army on the enemys border and as long as you dont cross into it he wont even blink
then you drop the hammer and sweep through their territory domination of resources
a critical and wholely realistic factor in the civ world is the control of limited resources required to building units and advancing
for example if you develop the wheel and see horses in open terrain you had better get those horses all of them into your territory before the enemy does
procurement of horses gives you chariots and horsemen which have the huge advantage of withdrawing from combat when losingthis example carries over into all other game resources
without rubber you have no infantry
without oil you have no tanks no planes and no battleships
you may have to attack enemy cities that control these resources
or you can raid those resource sites cut off access by destroying roads which prevents the enemy from using those resources to build needed units until he can build the road again geographical placement
the ai doesnt consolidate their empire according to geography as well as humans can selling captured cities
if you capture a city and expect that you cant hold it its often beneficial to sell the thing
this way you can get lots of advances and resources for what may be zero cost depending on how the battle went
better yet if the city being sold belongs to a civ with a strong culture the city may revert back to your enemies or be capture by your enemies allowing you to recapture and resell it
muhahahahahahahaaaa save inspect reload
save the game
spy on an enemy city to determine its strength and the units there
once you know this reload the game
this way you save hundreds of gold pieces but you still know whats therethese are just a few tactics i personally use
its impossible to name them all and considering the depth of the game im sure there are many more out there you can findnow addressing the complaints about the game why do i need a better system to play
this is because civ is designed to be better than previous civs
better ai more options to win better graphics and better interface
this all demands more computing power
if you just want something that runs on a p mhz why not stick with civ combat is unrealistic
not so
in fact i love the combat simulator
its all match
one complaint here is that simple units can destroy advanced units
i dont think those who complain are looking at the match unit type and geography
for example how can samurai beat a tank
heres howsamurai attack strength is   tank defense strength is   the combat math adds the attack strength  and the defense strength  and comes out with   then it rolls a random number and say it comes out with  it will give the samurai the victory and the tank will lose one hit point
now the tank has a  chance of winning the battle against the samurai
the samurai could win
two samurai would almost certainly winnow this is because tanks are offensive units
a tanks strength is halved when its just sitting there acting like a pillbox
on attack a tank strength is   so add     a random role between  and  is thrown
if the number lands between  the samurai defends
if the number is between  the tank wins
the tank has a  chance of winning
three out of four samurai are toastrealism in attack strengths most reviewers who criticize the combat cite that simple units have no way of combatting more advanced units
for example how is a samurai going to defend against a tank
well youre assuming that both parties are on a perfectly flat open field and the buttonedup tank is going against a samurai standing with his sword
in reality i can only imagine that a bunch of samurai would not do this but build barriers try to make terrain traps for the tanks etc
you also have to factor in the losses from normal breakdowns and maintenance which can be significant
also from my observations the computer doesnt cheat with combat numbers but production numbers in the citiesalso geography plays a huge part
put your infantry in a hill and the hill boosts defense 
that means defense for infantry goes up to   infantry in a mountain have defense of   try attacking that treat and see how far you getbasically you could put a spearman defense  into a city on a hill
now he has defense   then put a wall around the city and he has defense boosted 
now his defense is six
try attacking him with anything less than cavalry and watch a bronze age spearman tear you a new one
heheheheheh
good thing  the computer doesnt like to make walls and barracks
corruption and waste
if you cities are too far from your capital youre screwed
you need your cities spaced strategically around the capital otherwise they dont pay you money etc
the courthouse option imho is not strong enough because it barely decreases corruption
the forbidden palace though is an awesome tool and virtually eliminates corruption in the cities surrounding the place it sitswell i guess i rambled enough
i just love this game because there are so many ways to win so many different paths to take
the only thing i dont like is its too addictive
i need to sleep sometimesthis is a great game but after a while it starts to get boring
you can play as many nations but i prefer to be american
if you play it too much you might feel like you never want to play it again
i just suggest that you dont play it constantly and only every once in a whilelike many others i bought this game with high expectations
i dont think that they were unfounded given civ civ and alpha centauri
heres what i foundpros improved diplomacy improved trade model see cons better graphics and sound addition of culture a defininte improvementcons unrealistic corruption levels  in democracy with wonders in many cities artillery shiptoshore bombardment and air power very ineffective compared to previous games and real life settlers seem to still need to cross land by foot in  you think that eventually they might learn to use an ox cart
i mean i usually use a truck when i movewhile trade model is improved can never seem to get other civs to give balanced trade if any guys armed with stone clubs beat tanks
true there are a few examples guys on horseback with spears and rocks beating tanks but this is pretty darn rare and occurs often in game extreme difficulty getting a leader which is vital in the game
ive played seven full games so far and managed to get two leaders did i mention the overwhelming corruption irregardless of government type improvements or military units in city
i could go on and on  still im playing the game and checking the web site daily hoping for a patch that will fix some of these issues
i also miss the movies when wonders are developedhope this helpscivilization  is the longawaited followup to civ  the fantastically successful empirebuilding simulation
as a result there were bound to be lots of people disappointed because you cant please everyone
for most people however civ  is an excellent game and one that will definitely give you a lot of entertainment for your moneyif youve never played civ  youre in a good position to jump into civilization   players of civ  will have more to adjust to such as a revamped combat system which some say is woefully unbalanced with spear carriers occasionally defeating tanks and expanded diplomacytrade options
civ  seems to more about land masses and continents instead of a quotnationquot comprised of a bunch of random cities
also a new culture model lets you personalize your civilization while also using culture to form your national border
these might seem like subtle changes but i think most people will agree that they eventually lead to a drastically different and more satisfying game experienceso should you buy civ 
there are a few downsides that might not make it a perfect choice for everyone
for example if youre looking for topnotch d graphics youll be disappointed but nevertheless this is still easily sid meiers bestlooking game ever
the animations are particularly good but a vocal minority seem to miss the video clips that populated civ   there are also some bugs in the initial version of the game but what game doesnt have bugs upon initial release these days
perhaps the biggest omission of all no multiplayer support
that is a big surprise and it is the reason i cant give this game a fivestar review
going into  its just unacceptable for developers to leave out multiplayer support
still the positives easily outweigh the negatives
the game has an epic feel that most games never come close to achieving
the user interface isnt completely mousedriven but its still excellent and incorporates good features such as city queues to help you plan ahead from alpha centauri its predecessor
the new civilizations are much improved and each one has unique units for further variation
bottom line this is very fun strategy game with a lot of replay value but if you buy it early remember to expect a few bugs
a patch will be released for download sooner or later to tidy up the loose ends
its just part of the territory with pc games these dayshave been a fan of civ  ever since civ  came out
this newest edition to the civ family is great in that it is the first one that sid myer has had anything to do with in years
the graphics are awesome but there are some problems
we are back to the same outmoded ai that allows a warrior to kill a tank
also i made the mistake of exchanging world and territory maps with everyone on my first big game
that was a huge mistake since it lengthened my game time by hours since when you have a world map and access to other tribes movements you have to wait for all of their units to move before you can play
that can take a huge amount of time and even though i turned everything off in graphics that i could i still had to wait for every other tribe to movethose problems aside the new diplomatic options and the new victory options are a lot of fun
there are several new ways to win civ now that can considerably shorten each game  if that is what you want to do
it also individualizes the game play a bit more for those people who like to play with different strategies
now you can win through cultural domination  world domination through space race and a couple of other options
its funthis is a great addition to the civ family of games  with just a few glitchesive played all of the civilization versions obsessively and this is by far the best of them
hours and hours of play and i havent had to crack a manual yet thanks to the tuturial and the quotcivilopediaquot  its a combination of sim strategy and just enough rpg to make it intersting
its a bit slowmoving at times but what civilization was built in a day right
the civedit program and the other options make this a completely customizable game  make it as easy or as challenging as you want
this is one purchase im glad i madei am not a veteran of the civilzation series so i am writing this review based solely on my experiences with this game and not sids other works although i did have a blast with alpha centauriill keep this short and pithy
its a good game and sucks away your time
i am on a very fast computer gig wgig ddr ram and the times it takes calculating turns are not the sharpest out there
also this game has some very odd unit imbalances eg  musketman you heard me taking out st century afvs
you can spot other small imbalances in the game which are more bothersome then a hinderance of gameplay but overall if you enjoy strategy empirebuilding games pick this one upbratz dolls are ten times better than this game
i gipt my sister because i broke it by throughing against the wall
all these other geeks say its worth the money but i say they should give you the game and payyou unlike the newer ds titles this game tried something that no other handheld had tried up to this point
a totally rendered fps
not isometric like doom or dark forces
it is interesting to note that they did port doom and doom ii to the gba as well
it is also interesting to note that the controls are different since there are no buttons for looking like in some of the ds titles
this is also a port of the pc version of the game so the difference is no driving levelsoverall a great little gem
pick it up especially if you are a bond fan
the major drawback is that the characters are hard to see at times
a bit revolutionary considering they ported this game to the gba at the time nightfire the third best gba fps and the th released
 nightfire definitely delivers from start to finish
we get an indepth story with neat cutscenes walltowall action and an amazing graphic system
the graphics may look a little grainy but it is one of the most advanced developed for the gba and pretty impressive
nightfire also delivers by giving us a nice variety of weapons and qlab gadgets
we get our usual assortment of pistols and machine guns the bullet shells release from the guns side when you fire
and our gadgets include a cellphone grapple used for reaching high places a laser watch a pda used to hack a tranquilizer dart pen and a little cd hidden in a credit card to monitor computer sysems
so far so good
the  levels the game features are enormous and quite a challenge to get through
youll find yourself playing the same mission quite a bit in order to get past
awesome boss battles are also a great edition to the game
the game is a challenge a fun challenge at thatthe game over all is not bad
i think they tried to puch the graphics way to far
and while they look choppy and blurry the gaem survives ok you run shoot evade cameras stun gaurds colect items make timed escapes pick locks and use stratedgy
not bad
and you can make out what things look like at least unlike medal of honor
it would be a much better game if it had better graphics but its still not badplaying gameboy was always a problem but now with this light its not
the light is bright enough for you to see in the dark and you bend to put in a certain position and it wont break
the only bad thing is is that it drains the batteries faster
so if you get this make sure you have long lasting batteries but even withou the battery draining its a good thing to buy for a person with a gbathis worm light matches your white gba it works nice but it puts a dot in the middle of your screen but so far it is the best one outall in all this is a fairly decent adventure game with exceptional graphics and a sooth game play
i resorted to a walk through several times but it was mainly sheer impatience on my part rather than extreme difficulty in the puzzles
most are rather straight forward although some involve pixel hunting that can cause terminal squintingthe premise is not as bad as ive seen in other games and anyone who looks for great plotlines in a game is usually disappointed
suffice it to say you visit several different worlds and need to accomplish various tasks in each
my favorite was the icy siberian type locale which boasted a few interesting and unusual puzzles
characters range from the very boring and stilted heroine with the absolute worst voice acting ive ever heard  it was almost enough to make me want to mute the whole thing and just read the subtitles to a hilarious mummy who helps her out during the egyptian phase of the gamebottom line is that the game kept me entertained for a few hours it is actually quite a short game although as i said i cheated a few times to hurry things along
but dont expect it to win any game of the year awardsi thoroughly enjoyed beyond atlantis  because it was a change of pace from the usual make em guess at whats going on and what to do next sort of games ive managed to purchase lately
the storyline pretty much made sense and better than most ive played however there are the inevitable disjointed moments inherent in pc gamesbasically you are an archaeologist and are captured by the bad guy who makes you investigate the mystery of the site for him
the story takes place in several areas that differ widely and you find yourself taking on the life of someone else a thief in baghdad or ice age woman which is a different twist from the usualbeyond atlantis  will not tax your brain too much the puzzles are moderate to easy and are clever
there are puzzles using inventory but accessing your inventory is simply a matter of right clicking in and out of it
you must pick up a few items and a couple are very hard to findthere are a several puzzles that send you back to the beginning of that particular scene not the game
if you are wrong or do not act in the proper order and the proper order is the puzzle
this can get frustrating
many will find one area with its intricate looking paths and fisheye view extremely difficult
but it looks worse than it is and you cannot get lost
look carefully and you will notice landmarks to guide you
even with random clicking i always came back to the same spoti used uhs hints a few times but never for a full solution a gentle nudge was adequate
if you like hard intricate puzzles you will be disappointed in ba
there are hints given in the game via the characters you meet listen carefullyi enjoyed the humor greatly
from the wisecracking mummy with a cold who sits tapping his bony fingers against his sarcophagus while waiting for you to the eunuch guards who do a little jig as they get out of your way
you even find humor in the puzzles
getting up the tower steps involves playing a game with a monkeythe voice acting with one glaring exception is done very very well
unfortunately that character is you and you have to listen to a beautiful accent delivered without any expression at all
everyone else though is better than the average game
the music was also better than average although repetitiousthe graphics were lovely and nicely detailed with good use of color
cut scenes were nicely done and were not skimpy
i loved the carving coming to life
my  year old laptop had no trouble running the program however i think the graphics might have been sharper had it been on a better machine
options are easy to access and useas a parent i appreciate comments that alert me to questionable content so heres a few notes for those of you with younger kids and who would rather not be surprised when a guard gets his throat cut
there is violence from knives and guns
there is also a character a thief who encounters  very very scantily clad women think janet and her pasties
there are  swear words nothing worse that what most kids hear on tvoverall beyong atlantis  is short fun easy to look at and will make for a pleasant weekenda beautiful game with minor drawbacks
i had no problems installing it it ran very smoothly
the plot is not very cohesive but i didnt mind at all
just a load of fun travelling from world to world and solving the puzzles
wich i must say are not so difficult as some people would like you to believe
you definitely dont need a walkthrough for this one
the game is perfectly rendered the graphics are myst exile quality  much better than had expected from a game that is relatively cheap and much better than for example schizm
the main personage is a sort of lara croft including the tombraiderstyle clips but the acting is horrible however
the faces of the personages look like they have all been very very drunk last night
that should have been much much better
the voiceacting is bad
so a star off for that
having said that i would recommend this game
its fun its reasonably immersive and its worth the money
i applaud the makers for continuing to make adventuregames some perfect some just fun
for this kind of money
a good buyholy cow this game is fun
wwii online has worked through its early problems and while not perfect is still just about the most fun ive had playing an online game
its amazingly immersive and well modeled
just the driving a tank for example is better than most tank sims ive played
and thats only one part of the gameyou can fly a plane man a gun or attack as infantry
all the parts are modeled differently and all the vehicles have different strengths and weaknesses
this is a tough game to get tired of since theres so many things to trya few warnings  you will need a decent processor and video card to play this
mb of ram is also a big help
the learning curve can also be a bit steep at first but its not too insanely tough to get the hang of
also a note to fps fans  this is not quake ii
i f you expect to jump in as infantry run off by yourself and take on the enemy you will last about ten seconds
this game requires strategy teamwork and patience  one shot can kill and the guy who will get you is the one you dont seeminus one star because of the high system requirements and a few remaining gameplay issues
the game has evolved so much since its initial release however that i am confident it will only get better and betterthis game rocks  go buy itmech commander  is definetly worth the price
i have played through this game  times myself
the delicously fun mix of smashing other mech forces and building a personal army of trained killers is something that must be experienced
i enjoyed every moment and i would sit glued to my screen for hours
on the minus side a few niggles
some of the great mechs of the battletech universe are missing here like the nova and enforcer iii
of course this is a problem with all the mech warrior games too so i can live
there is also a painful learning curve to begin with as one must get used to the strange line of sight and sensor rules
but once you have it anyone can be a mech commander
if you like small unit tactics and you like mechs this is where your money should gosince the original quotmechwarriorquot came out in the lates ive loved each and every installment of the computerizedbattletech universe including this one
mechcommander  puts you in strategic command of a quotsquadquot of mechs officially referred to as a lance
its the difference between tactical mechwarrior versus strategic control mechcommander action mw versus strategy mc but it all comes down to huge robots spewing destruction and mayhempros good atmosphere solid graphics fantastic battle sound effects an easy to use interface for customizing mechs faithful to the original adjustable difficultycons too few missions frustrating limits on deployment tonnageall in all this is a fantastically enjoyable game
the acting and missionbriefings give a nice feel for the direction of the game and let you feel like youre a mercenary with a soul but the plot is linear and there arent any really surprising twists
as a whole the gameplay is superb enabling you to go right into the missions with minimal quottrainingquot and the camera is very well designed letting you maintain an optimum view of the fightthe graphics are very good not quite excellent but they certainly didnt skimp here
it would have been nice to zoom even closer to the mechs and see battle damage but to be fair its a useless feature if youre really trying to wage war and would have taken too much processing power on slower systems
the sound is also well done but left me wanting more
i miss the rumble and stomp of listening to hundreds of tons of metal stomp across the landscape
you get to hear all the sounds of the battle weapons firing explosions etc and those are very well done but the game would have been much more immersive if you could hear your mechs tromping the faunathe weapons were very nicely developed with a good balance between the different systems missles energy ballistic etc
you definitely have to strategize here and plan the outfitting of your mechs carefully
if you have a bunch of ton mechs all with longrange weaponry itll only take a few ton mechs with decent shortrange weaponry to get in close and whittle your armor away like snapping anklebiting poodles
planning is the key and the interface for customizing your mechs is well layed out for the experience and novice mechcommander alikefinally and this is my only major gripe the original mech commander was billed as companylevel combat meaning you commanded forces of up to  mechs ranging from  tons each
in this installment the number of mechs you can field is limited by the maximum tonnage you can deploy
the largest this ever reaches is the final mission at  tons
in case youre counting that means four  ton mechs and a  tonner
frankly thats a huge waste of potential especially when i had about  assault mechs each weighing  tons ready and waiting for deployment by the last missionbut thats my only real complaint
as a whole this is a supremely enjoyable game and ill be playing it through again very shortlysega has done a nice job on chu chu rocket the great gameplay makes up for the poor graphics
the object of the game is to direct your chu chus or space mice with arrows you place on the board to guide them to the safety of the rockets but not if the kapu kapus or space cats have something to say about it keep kks out of your rockets and lead them into an foes rocket cuasing them to lose points
however there are many other modes of play besides this i personally love puzzle mode you have a limited  of arrows to place and guide your ccs past kks and pits to guide them to the rocket
you think youll beat the few puzzles on this game in a matter of hours but there are actually over  puzzles to play
plus you can create and save over  puzzles of your own creation i just love creating difficult puzzles and letting my siblings try and solve them oh how many times brother has yelled quotthis is impossiblequot
other modes of play in this game include feed the cat team battle player battleswith one game pack
 mice and you can even create your own characters to replace the chu chus image who knows you could animate a digital quotyouquot and watch the kks eat the quotyousquot up
this games fun level does waver from time to time but youll always come back for more
be sure to check out my other reviews by clicking on more about me my other reviews includegolden sun dodge ball advancefortress and when i get a gcn i hope to write many reviews on those games
here is a summary of chu chu rocket
out of controlgameplayfun factor depends on if your in the mood for itreplay valuewell since there are  puzzles to complete i dont know if ill ever acually quotreplayquot the game but in player i give varietygraphicssega seems to have sarted a puzzle game line chu chu rocket monkey ball whats next lab rat mania where you run through mazes and collect cheese
oh well this game is greatim not even going to try and explain the purpose of this game or how you play it as it would probly only be confusing to you until you actually see it done but basically its a puzzle game that offers a variety of scenarios with the same puzzle set
while some of the puzzles get esquishiatingly hard on higher levels there is always a solution sometimes more and this game somehow draws you into keep playing it
the only thing keeping me from giving it  stars is its a tad repetive and shallow its basically one puzzle on different scenarios or maps so to speak
the mp is very fun though and only requires one game packthe beauty of dungeon siege lies in its simplicity
it is not often that you get an rpg which has both a simple user friendly interface and an engine that automatically customises the way you play your characterdungeon siege is the work of chris taylor the genius behind the award winning total annihilation
his goal was simple create a game that is not riddled with overhwhelming statistics and present a clean and understandable interface that is accessible to all kinds of gamers
and taylor has succeeded in both areasdungeon siege simply moves away from the hardcore dd rulebased rpgs like neverwinter nights icewind dale baldurs gate etc and instead allows a player to expertise in either melee ranged combat magic or nature magic classes
the three essential skills that get affected according to your style of play are strength dexterity and intelligence
but instead of customising skills manually you play the character the way you like and the system will automatically enhance your characters skills in that class acordingly
this is an incredible and innovative feature
so if you want to expertise in swords and maces your melee skills and strength evolves
if you want to develop in ranged combat your dexterity and armor rating gets enhanced
consequently you are awarded titles like swordsman marksmam archmage etc
if you plan to infuse both melee and ranged skills you become a manatarms etc
the combinations are truly staggering
as the main character you can hire folks to a maximum of eight whom you can cutomise to suit your style of play
so a well balanced team should comprise some fighter ranger and spellcasters
dabble with the group in any way you like
its really funyou have stores from where you can trade stuff and also have the ability to buy pack mules which carry three times your inventory
another innovative  and really vital feature introduced in dungeon siege is that you drink potions only as much as you need
this could prove valuable in certain toughtobeat fights
so if you are a newcomer to the world of rpgs dungeon siege doesnt bog you down with difficult levelling ups
you play in manner that fits your style and consequently have more fun
i think thats what taylor was looking at
the fun factor
and he has definitely achieved thatbut the game wouldnt have been fun it wasnt impressive to look at and dungeon siege has made absolutely sure you dont turn your face away from the screen even for a second
to this day the graphics are one of a kind
true d environments allow you to gaze through the deepest gorges and stare the most vast and forbidding landscapes from a tower
the characters and animation is so well done that you can actually see their outfits appear perfectly distinct and insync with what is shown in the inventory
the spell affects are great and myriad enviroments are all distinct and beautiful
in short this is the best looking game in the rpg genre
i would rate neverwinter nights alongside but this game has true depth and grandeur
for a game of this scope what is absolutely astonishing is that the game has practically no loading time
each terrain seamlessly loads up without pausing or breaking the gameplay
please do me a favour
if you ever come across a bridge pan your vision so that you see the gorge from above or at an angle
it is breathtaking and a testament to the hardwork and talent of gas powered gamesthe music is something that isnt as epic as you would hope
the soundtrack is mainly generic but it serves its purpose
however there are a few set pieces that are truly outstanding
almost classical in tune
i was absolutely spellbound listening to a soft mandolin score while i gazed at the lovely ice capped mountains
i assure you such moments come quite often and are memorableafter all the wonderful features that dungeon siege has introduced it cannot but spill out a few disappointments
for one the story is absolutely ludicrous
being an rpg there is no characterisation
hence you cannot empathise much with any of the npcs or characters in your group
the game comes with minimal conversation and the voice acting is pretty average
the world of ehb though fantastic is a bit nonsensical in structure
and the gamers who have grown to love the rich dd rules used in the classic rpgs will sorely miss and get turned off by lack of manually customisable featureshowever the positives far outweight these blemishes
dungeon siege is terrific entertainment
it is game that doesnt take itself too seriously but it presents the technology in the most accessible manner possible
do yourself a favour and check out dungeon siege
have a nice dayi first played dungeon seige as a demo
it was pretty much just the first level but i was able to let a couple of characters join me on my quest and i even bought a pack mule
i was so impressed with the demo i rushed out and bought the full version
i bought it at the same time i purchased morrowind and i like this game so much better
however eventually i started playing morrowind a lot more and suddenly dungeon seige didnt seem so special anymore
however it was the game that got me interested in rpgs
before this i was pretty much just playing first person shooters like doom and serious sam so this was a welcome change for me
i could choose my characters sex
i could choose her hair color
what she wore
i named her
and the graphics were great
at first i was a little annoyed with the pointandclicktowhereyouwantyourcharactertogo feature but it did allow for multiple camera angles which was good
my other complaint is the fighting
ok there is a really big snow monster
now just watch as your characters do the work for you
you dont even have to click the mouse button to make them battle
i wasnt used to that
while i guess that can be nice at times its also a little boring
of course while your characters are fighting you do have stuff to keep you busy like making sure none of them run low on health or mana
though it is really fun to resurrect one of your characters if they die in battle  it makes you feelpowerful so far i have played close to  hours but ive had the game for  months now
for the most part its just collecting dust
i honestly do still adore the game but after a while it gets too repetetive  go into a cave or dungeon kill evil things take gold and other assorted loot emerge from cave or dungeon  hours later
go stock up on health mana armor and spells at a store walk a little ways then enter another cave or dungeon
personally i prefer the freedom of morrowind dungeon seige is very linear but ill always have a soft spot for this onelets start with the bottom line which will tell those who dont know anything about the game what they need to know and inflame some of the prods types just for the fun of itdungeon siege is diablo iii
its diablo from its basic concept down to the littlest details
if you enjoy diablo i did chances are youll like this
if you didnt like diablo you wont like dungeon siegesure there isnt a skill tree and you control multiple characters at once well you turn multiple characters loose at once to do their own thing which usually involves either stupidly pulling way too much to the group or ignoring a party member getting pasted but in so many ways the game doesnt just use the conventions of the genre it does exactly what was done in diablo from the big scale random magical prefixes and suffixes on found objects to the ridiculously small scale regular items have yellowish white labels when the drop on the ground magical items have blue
and the multiplayer world includes waypoints diablo iistyle that just like in diablo ii have to be unlocked by going to the furthest ones first
the whole multiplayer world revolves around unlocking the big waypoints that connect the cities of the utraean penninsula
for those who havent played the diablo series yet all three of you that means dungeon siege is about running from one horde of monsters to another stomping them flat taking all of their loot doing one or two quests at a flatout run then repeating
thats it
and given that you can give your group individual commands that control how they behave theres not always a lot to do after that
this is the first nonsim game ive been able to play while walking to the kitchen and fixing myself a snack
because hey i know they can handle the hordes of spiders in that great hallthe game did not ship with its editor or the second multiplayer world which is a pity
both will extend the life of this game a fair bit
as it is after the rather long singleplayer game and running around the expansive multiplayer world although most of that map isnt required to complete the multiplayer quest meaning many people wont see all of it most players will put it down
now the diablo ii players who clawed their way up to level  will have a chance to get to level  in dungeon siege but for those who dont want to hunt in a given dungeon  or  times thats pretty much it for the gamesome positives the game is breathtakingly beautiful the d camera control is fairly intuitive the class system is interesting if a bit thin and pack mules are cute and its puzzling why no one else has ever put them in a game before to my knowledgeso once again that bottom line dungeon siege is diablo iii
if that sounds like a good thing to you its a definite buy
if that sounds like something youre not interested in stay awayi must admit i bought this game because of the beautiful screenshots on the back
usually when i do this im disappointed with the game
not this time though
what i found was a story and game every bit as appealing as the graphics
dungeon siege was definitely worth the moneythis is your typical farmboytohero scheme
along the way you find more weapons and encounter people willing to join you in your quest
you develop the character the way you want to and theres no restraint on the way you develop him unlike diablo
this is a great aspect because if you start a character and decide you dont like the way hes going you dont have to start a new oneyou just change gears and develop him another wayanother great part of this game is the enormous variety of weapons and spells
there is always something new to discover as you mercilessly slaughter every monster imaginable
most notably are the summon spells everything from a scorpion when youre weak to a drake or lava monster when youre strongds does very well in the single player department and this because of its superb party control
you can have up to  in your partymages archers melee fighterseven a donkey to haul your stuff if youre a packrat like me
the first time you go through this game is incredible and theres always the chance you can encounter or hire different characters the next time aroundmultiplayer is also great in ds
in this mode you only control one character but you can join a party with up to   there are many bugs in mp it is true the foremost being that your game is paused every time a new player enters the game but it is still very enjoyable
there is a different world to explore and a lot of big creatures to fightspeaking of the big creatures they are worth mentioning
it is truly a lot of fun to go on a quest after one of these monsters
my favorite is the fury the great hovering demon that strikes terror into the heart of the stoutest warrior
the gigantic red dragon is also fun to defeatso why  stars why not 
well the game does have some flaws
first the single player campaign doesnt have a lot of replay ability
once youve gone through a couple of times its pretty much old news
since the multiplayer mode has only one other world at least last i knew it too can become a bore
quests in mp are almost nonexistent and the game is reduced to killing stuffdont get me wrong i like killing stuff
its one of my favorite things to do in a fantasy game
but mp mode would benefit from more quests
who knows maybe in an expansionall in all this game is a musthave for anyone who loves rpgs
buy this game and youll find yourself more involved then you knowthis game for all its fun is rather confining
you arent given the opportunity to rove at will
i really like to be able to go anywhere i want to
in this game you have to go in one direction fighting a plethora of creaturesthe world itself is beautifully done and the creatures you fight are some of the best around
there was basically no story you just fight
for those who love a good hack and slash youll love this game
i found it exciting at first but then thats all you do
no real puzzles to solve no mysteries
oh sure you have the odd quest now and then but nothing that really challenges youi gave this a four star rating because despite the linearness of it i really enjoyed itpretty nice graphics not much charecter development
you juz pick what you want to kill with and thats it
lots of different weapons though with many different magical bonuses
even unique items
only thing that kept me interested
after playing the single player storyline theres a bigger online storylinethis game is pretty fun bys yourself but even more fun when you play coop with some friends
i actually broke my mouse a few weeks back playing this game
it is really fun
the d isometric graphics are top freakin notch as well as the spell effectsif you want a game like torment fallout or arcanum
you will have to look elsewhere
but if you want a clickiy game like diablo  but better imho then this is where you goi was very excited about getting this gameafter i read so many glowing comments in various pc gaming magazinesso i bought it the moment it came outand have been playing single and multiplayer off and on ever sincethe graphics are extremely gorgeousand the creatures are pretty cool toothe background music fits the actionatmosphere perfectlyi think this is the most stunningly beautiful game i have ever seenplayedmy complaint
as with most other games of this genreafter a while it gets to be boring slashing and hacking away constantlywith no let up in sight
i have my characters stats built up to a reasonable leveland then can drink coffee while they efficiently kill off all the monsters
i would like it to have been a little more challengingala clive barkers undying
although it is easy to play and win this gamei think the reason i keep at it is because the thing looks so amazingand sounds so goodand the multiplayer world is even more beautifulif thats possiblesoall in alli am glad i got the gameand the developers should certainly win some awards for what they accomplishedbut i wish it had been just a little tougher to playi will stick with itthoughto see what new and cool creature pops up on the horizon nextbtw the game has run flawlesslyboth single and multiplayeri am running windowsxp on a  p pcwith ramits like diablo ii with much better graphics
however it can get tedious at times just like diablo ii and its quotrole playingquot elements are fairly light
i still enjoy it a lot and recommend it to anyone who liked diablo iii bought this game when i got hung up on might  magic ix and didnt know what to do about it
i played it for a while and then got some help for mmix so i went back to it
i have now finished both games and what a world of difference
dungeon siege has none of the delay every time you go into or leave a building while your computer loads from your disk
they both have the feature that seems to be popular now of increasing the skill of the one you use
with dungeon siege it does mmix one better because you can have anyone pick up a sword or buy a spell book and use it and change a fighter into a mage
i like this because when you start a game you dont usually know what you need in the way of characters and this lets them learn as they go
there is no thief character as in most games that usually spends most of his time hiding because he is too weak to be much good in a fight
anyone can open chests and doors
there isnt the usual boring nap time after every fight either
your characters heal up or replace magic fairly fast ant there are helth and mana potions to hurry that along
you should keep well stocked with these as they come in handy when opponents come at you fast and furious
a mage with healing hands can help as well as he can heal during a fight
save during a fight
sure no problem but make sure you have a backup save just in case you save in the middle of a fight you cant winthe graphics are rd person and very detailed
if you buy a new hat and equip it the screen character will be shown wearing it
the world is a far cry from the old blocky dungeons of old and i found myself just looking around some areas after they were cleared out because of the sceneryi liked the concept of the mule to help cary extra items that you arent quite skilled enough to use or extras you want to sell later
the mule will pay for itself in this regard fairly quicklythere are long range and melee weapons as usual but each weapon has its own range and speed as well as hit points it can deliver
is it beter to use a lower powered fast long ranged weapon or a slow shorter ranged weapon with more power
remember the enemy has weapons of longer and shorter range as wellwhat would have been nice adition would have been a large map showing your location and only the places you have visited
there is a small map that you can even direct your characters and fight from but many of the locations are very large and the small map just isnt big enoughi usually buy a hint book with every game but with this game i hardly ever used it
the only time i used it was when i had cleared out and searched an area and wanted to make sure i hadnt missed somethingall in all it ran fine on my pentium iii  mhz machine running xp and with an old dfx voodo cardalthough im writing this review more than a year after purchase dungeon siege is still fresh on my mindthe goodeasiest to use and most comfortable interface and ingame camera in any rpg i have ever playedstoryline is entertainingdiverse challenging enemies and situationsskill system is simple and doesnt require much planninggraphics are decent excellent d enginealmost no quotloadingquot screens at allyou can customize the way your character looksthe badskill system limited lackingstory is not that greatno video cinematics all are ingameas far as gameplay this game involves a lot of journeying to new places
in fact you always have to go somewhere
it gets a little tiresome around the middle
there is an element missing from the story because you never see many quotinnocentsquot or average people only monsters and a dozen npcs
it needs some scenes of towns with people to give a feel of what nation it is youre part of and defendingthe skill system allows you to gain experience based on your use of certain magic or weapons
after a time you gain strength for using melee weapons or dexterity for using ranged
when using magic intelligence is raised using nature magic for examplethis skill system is a very odd departure from the usual sort of system where the user is usually given a choice to allocate these things manually
thats a negative imo because it simplifies the gameplay to too great a point and it limits the types of characters you can expect to makethe only other major issue i have with the game is there are no combat skills
the only thing melee characters do is swing and thats so boring after a while
if you use magic there are lots of spells but magic isnt that strongit retains some element of fun until the very end
at the end though you feel like trying to run past all the enemies because its so boring to sit there and hack on them
the last boss is interesting and challenging but the enemy group you fight is generally a dissapointment
theyre not scary theyre almost cute
i thought the spiders kept me on edge more than the seckdungeon siege was one of the most anticapated games of e  it had beautiful graphics beautiful landscapes the gameplay was simplified making it a different more enjoyable rpg and the sound effects were great
now finally the wait is over
i picked up dungeon siege at eb game world and here is what i have to say about dsdungeon siege i think is definetely revolutionary
there are so many great things that no one would think of putting into an rpg that truely make this game an experience
the graphics are on a d world not a grid or map
there are pack mules which quite geniously have a large inventory to cary your extra items
the sound effects are great with the help of creatives eax
lastly dungeon siege is very flexible letting you change your mind on the flythe graphics in dungeon seige are incredible
there has never been an rpg out yet that has as good a graphics engine as ds
it is not on a map or grid but in a d rendered world
i also enjoy the fact that i have never seen a loading screem and never will thanks to the enginethe packmules are genious
every rpg should have something like a packmule for now on
the packmules are great
they have  times the inventory size of your character making it easy to cary many excess items that you may have use for later on
they are also very smart
the ai is literally very good
when you get into a battle the pack mule will run away until the battle is over and it will then come back
also if the mule gets attacked by an enemy it will kick it
although this is good it isnt very strong
you still have to watch your little packmule to see what kind of trouble it gets into
if a swarm of enemies like a swarm of fireshooting krugs it will most likely be trapped thus making you be the one to save itwith the help of creatives eax dungeon siege has the best sound effects i have ever heard in a computer game
i also enjoyed the background music
the music would have decreshendos and creshendos making the game more exciting
it is like being in a horror moviethe gameplay for ds is also great
you only have to click once to kill an enemy
finally
my hands will not fall assleep from clicking and clicking repetively to kill an enemy like in diablo 
this is a great feature but another good feature in gameplay is the flexibility
chris taylor the creator and leader of gas powered games has made the game so flexible that you can change your mind on the fly
in the beginnning of the game you start out as a farmer not noing much of any skill like melee range or combat and nature skills
you are basically equal in evrey aspect but very low
it is not in d where you chose someone with different skills different attacks and different weapon choices
no
in ds you develope your character as you go along
you choose wheather you want to be a mage or a melee weapon user or an archer
that is all up to you
you can even say well i have enough archers in my party so i want to have a combat and nature mage
you have  people in your party so it is always easy to change people around without having to many of one skilldownsides yes there are some downsides to the game
first off the game is very brainless
you just go into the cave filled with monsters find that the entranceexit is blocked off need to find the other caved filled with monsters go into endless rooms filled with the same creatures and exit it and then blow up the entrance or whateveri was surprised to hear this but i have heard from people farhter in the game than me that there are vehicles grenades and guns
now i have no idea what time this game takes place in there is not much of a story line i will talk about that next but to the looks this game takes place in midevil times
but you have to remember that you can be a woman and at midevil times people did not have women fighting no offense to any woman out there reading this so this game could take place in the future
who knowslike i mentioned above there is absolutely no story line to the game
there is a short cinematic in the beginning saying how the kingdom of ehb where the game takes place is peaceful and then some monsters come and terrorize it
next thing you know your friend dies infront of you and then the game beginsso all in all this game is revolutionary but i dont know if people will be playing this game for a long time
you should still buy this game because it is revolutionary and it is very fun
i am just going to warn you that many serrious rpg gamers will not appreciate this game
most people will find it enjoyable but according to your own tastes it will depend on how long you like the game and play itdungeon siege by chris roberts is a great introduction to the world of rpg just like the diablo series
if you have a friend that likes console games or has never really delved into a hardcore rpg this will get them in the door
every aspect of this game is completely intuitive and can be mastered in secondsthe graphics are sumptious
neverwinter nights players will be impressed by the incredible camera control and beautiful outside environments as well as the huge variety of undergroundindoor textures
d video required i recommend at least geforce with g or more processor
i use geforce  w ghthe controls are overly simple
stick a weapon in every characters hand and click on a group of monsters then sit on your hands as the battle unfolds i recommend playing around with the camera and pause key for maximum effect if you are bored
this game is a goodybox of features that make rpg easier
invetory management is straight out of diablo   everyhting is drag and drop no weight to worry about
pack mules carry your extra stuff
waypoints formations quick keys even a transmute spell which can turn your less valuable and larger items into gold on the spot saving room for the really good stuff
partial potion drinking just what you need
quick sort buttons for inventory
click a button and everyone runs around picking up the treasure and loading it into the pack mulethere are no classes
you learn by doing
shoot an arrow get better with bows cast a healing spell get better at nature magic
you cant really get lost
if you do just look for the huge signs everwhere telling you where to goin fact the game is almost too easy to control and this ease takes away from the tactics which sadly is one of my favorite reasons for playing an rpg
but it looks awesomethis game is well done perhaps mindless in some way but addictive in others nice balance as well and fun worked well on laptops so i could play while traveling and such i also consider it a good go to game get bored of everything else here this game is and the cost to fire it up again is a big fat zero still in my collection ds  stars as well and though ive only done the demo to ds id downgrade it to  stars from what i saw
perhaps a little hasty with that judgement but it was so far off the mark as the previous two perhaps improved in graphics but lost in areas as well from my quick demo
i am still considering buying it though so perhaps my verdict will change given more time
however if your new to ds you likely should start with this one to save money and you could also try the demo of ds and go from there to help make your decision
id not play ds though and think the previous  are the samewow
what an amazing game
you better make sure you get off to a good start and select the right characters and weapons for your quests because if you mess it up your in for a hard timethe gameplay is wonderful and never gets boring and the graphics are very detailed and atmospheric
the monsters and enemies can sometimes be a bit generic and its not as gory as i would like it to be but this and the constant difficulty reduce this from a star rating to stari would recommend that you have a pentium iv processor and a decent graphics card if you want the best performance out of this game
and decent speakers would be appropriate for when you cast those booming spellslike most games these days this is designed for the most powerful and advanced machine
if you are fortunate enough to have one then buy this game to make the most of it
even if you are not a big rpg fan the fun never ends
and neither does the game apparently
ive still to finish it ok the reason i gave this four instead of five stars is the camera
over half of this game is spent in caves and buildings so dont you think they could have gotten the camera to work right in those situations
but the fact that you dont have to do frantic clicking to kill groups of enemies makes up for this
youre characters you have up to  of them will auto attack the closest enemy
so all you need to do is walk into a room and youre characters start the slaughter
then you can move the camera around to see what is going on kinda like watching a movie
also sometimes the only way you can tell which way to go is by the trail of enemies to fight
also this should be a budget game under money retail because it is just to short
seriously you could beat it in about  hours and that is if you get lost a lot
just another game that sacrifices leagth of play for graphics which are awesome
over all it beats diablo  in most areas graphics character customizing potion usage
that part is a great idea too
you only drink as much health potion as you need
not like diablo were you use a whole potion everytimei was greaty entertained by ds for its simple fun in great graphics
some of the sights in the game are a treat to see such as standing on top a tower looking out in to a lush forest complete with tree shrubs and flowers
unlike diablo the world feels large and lively that only d graphics could producethis is all tied with some nice music some of it interesting to hear but it is the usual epic fantasy themesi could forgive the lack of a story
lets be real we are going to end up killing monsters whatever the reason is
i am not really interested in talking to npcs for clever dialog or spending time reading volumes on a world that doesnt really exist
all i need to know is awhere are the monsters and bhow to kill the monsters
ds lets you do just thatsomething also has to be said for the lack of a story you are free to make up your own
there is no rule that game developers had to fill your imagination for youmy one real complaint is the skill system
if i am going to kill a lot of things for hours i want some really cool skills
i love how it works just that there is so little to work with
the  skill catagories could further broken up in to more diverse skill trees and still be as easy to useall that said this is an entertaining game for the uninspired
forget keeping track of tohit modifiers just click away to your hearts contentthe following pertains to gameplay controls and interface power management graphics sound multiplayer and rpg aspectgameplaya diablo type of hack and slash
some hardcore rpg enthusiasts dont like this too much but the game makes no secret about it
however you dont get the same fighting feeling as you do in diablo
even though the graphics are better in dungeon siege diablo models and animation looks more real and the action is more convincing
for instance in dungeon siege when a character takes a swing at a monster it looks like he misses
you cant tell if he hit the mark or not unless you look at the energy meter press x to activate energy meters or listen closely to a subtly distinct sound
most things react after the swing there seems to be a split second delaycontrols and interfaceif the controls and interface are bad it frustrates me to insanity and i retire the game baldurs gate but thats another story
the controls are mostly customizable
you can bind keys too many commands
however i cant seem to bind a key to a specific magic item for example
when i want pestilence and then quickly switch to soul lance i dont want to scroll i want to use keys
even when i try to save my weapon configurations it seems to save it only when it feels like it
another complaint is the camera movement
sometimes i want to click on something the walls are in the way and i get my butt whooped because the game fails to transparent the walls
furthermore sometimes the camera locks and i cant zoom in or out this is typical when you are close to a mountain or some other form of a wall
also using the character icons i click on one to select a character the camera automatically centers the character on the screen thus disorienting me and i have to quickly recalibrate my vision
it throws me off my battle groove
the solution to this is to give the user a choice to center the selected character or not maybe one click selects character and two clicks centers himthe interface is very friendly so if you dont know the keys you can search the screen and eventually find what you are looking for by way of interface
i love the way i have so many ways i can trade items with the shop and with my own characters
for example i can open all  of my characters inventory at the same time and just drag items back and forth into each of their inventories heck i can even drag an item on their icons and it works the same
i really appreciate the elasticity of the controls and interfacepower managementmy systemamd duron  cpumb ramgeforce mb mmx video cardgas powered games claims that this game is a revolution by way of having the entire world load in one shot therefore there is no loading during the game
you know what
its true and there are no claws about it
i am amazed
the power management for this game is quite impressive
you wont believe the load times for a new game or a saved game
it takes me about  seconds
now thats impressive
i dont feel too much strain on my cpu during play
and even though the frame rates usually read low say like fps i dont feel its that low though it could be better
i can even alttab easy
i can do things like surf the web for example while dungeon siege is waiting in the back and i dont feel any strain on my web surfinggraphicswhat can i say
amazing graphics
the environments are beautiful the lighting the shadows the colours oh the details
im sure youve heard it allsoundsound is nice but could be better
i think it is d i never tested it with my headphones just my speakersmultiplayermp is okay
you cant save where you left off you have to start back in town and the fog of war comes back so you have to trek and explore again  not fun
the game flamboyantly announces x has taken the lead with  kills
this discourages teamwork and greedy players leave their teammates behind in experience
dungeon siege is best played in single playerrpg aspectmany people see dungeon siege as a mix of baldurs gate and diablo
it is a mix but its more diablo
the story is not so complex and the npcs really dont say much well there arent many for that matter
only some npcs have audio
i like voice acting and i think there should have been more it gets you more into the story
one thing that frustrated me was the fact that every corner you turn there was a group of the same combination of monsters that you just fought off  seconds ago
its not the action that bothers me its how boring it gets
it got repetitive as you just fight drink health fight drink mana collect useless items and start the cycle again
to top it off you cant warp back to town to trade you just trek and trek and trek forward
there were no riddles to cross the bridge for instance and there were no character developments even if the character you hired was the one who gave you the mission in the first place he doesnt say anything when you complete his mission
heck you dont get squat for completing missionsis it a diablo killer
to hold the potential of being coined the diablo killer is to challenge this aspect of rpgthe straight up brutal hack and slash quality that is powered by its graphics animation and sound
dungeon siege does not equip itself to seriously challenge thisdungeon siege is a great game and it is certainly a revolution for rpg
my true score is really the only knock against this game is that it is very linear
it works on oss all the way up to windows  so dont worry about whether or not it will work on todays oss
dif you love the diablo or icewind dale games you will like this one
its easy to learn and very quickly you can get into the action and begin having fun
the graphics are spectacular and you dont need much computer to enjoy them
in fact the game engine is the best i have ever played
the interface is easier than icewind dale and you only need to control one player
spells can be a little awkward to use and you may have to pause the game but the actual fighting couldnt be easier because your character will attack enemy units on his own much like units in an rts game
there is no need to keep clicking away and you have more time to to evaluate your situation and tactics
usually the strategy is to enter an area carefully evaluate the scene counting the number of enemy etc
then you usually end up on the perimeter picking off the goblins and creatures a few at a time thining them out occasionally backing away to drink some health potion
if you just go running into an area you will find yourself surrounded and dead so you need to pick at them gradually reducing their numbers
its fununfortunately ds cant be considered a great game like diablo lod because it is too linear
the graphics are great but too much of the game is simply following pathways and fighting goblins
like diablo this will bring out your competitive nature and make you coming back for more but i can see why rpg purists didnt care for it
also like diablo you can meet up with a buddy in the multi player and do some one on one fighting but ds online community is nowhere on the same level as the vast community you find at diablos battlenet
on a positive note two friends can join up direct through their ip addressi began with ds by playing the demo because i was such a big fan of total annililation a chris taylor classic
i found the fighting and graphics exilerating so i bought the game but gs for me has never been an obsession in quite the way diblo  and icewind dale have been
it is too much of the same thinggame playbgraphicsastrategycstory linecreplayabilitydactionbover all a good fun game but not a classic and not deserving of socksyou know for a student at collegeive been twiddling my thumbs in such classes like c and other sorts just dyin to go home to play a phenomenon which has come to be known as dungeon siege
anyone else been playing this
they damn krugs ogre like creatures keep killing my whole damn party since my donkey loses control in single player but in multiplayer my level  ranger is a god of course the game has too much lag on kso i host and wait for the next person to enter my gameenough bout my personal experiencebasically i think this game is absolutly superb
if you have a half decent graphics card geforce  then this game will utilise the gpu in a stunning way
you definetly notice the tl textures and lighting features in the graphics card
the game doesnt have so much of a story but it does have absolutly stunning graphics
this is your simple hack and slash game similar to diablo and phantasy stars online
the game is slightly reptetitive but when playing online it brings the gaming to a whole new level as it extends your gameplaythe game does keep you occupied for a long time and its well worth the money i assure you dammit its addictivei picked this game up at a local store and was a little unsure at first if i was going to like it
i found it easy to play and also incredibly fun
the graphics are awesome and the game play is smooth
i would recommend this game to anyone who likes this sort of game or anyone who is interesting in trying these sorts of games for the first timedungeon siege is one of the most addictive games i have ever played
addictive to the point that youll realize youre suddenly more committed to the game than the rest of your life
lolseriously it is a gorgeous rpg
while im not usually into this genre of computer gaming i have been drawn to dungeon siege
ive noticed that hours go by playing it
the controls are as simplistic as they are intuitivea real plus
the games plot is not very deep but if you care to read the books you pick up along the way and if you pay attention to the cutscenes youll understand the storyline
depending on your personal style of play this may or may not appeal to youthere have been numerous complaints about how this game is just a very pretty hack and slash
i would tend to disagree with that statement
the graphics are beautiful
the gameplay is fun and what you really end up doing is walking through wilderness and dungeons slaying monsters
however its not like the diablo series where you control one character
dungeon siege is really about large party management you can control up to  characters
this becomes a real challenge deeper into the game
it also requires planning on the gamers part
in that way it plays out a bit like a strategy game
its not what id call difficult but its not a cakewalk eitherthe reason i do not give it a full five stars is because i have found a few issues with camera control
that and the gameplay can seem to get a bit monotonous in parts
overall however id recommend it to anyone new to the rpg genre or anyone who is casually interested in the genre
if youre a hardened vet from games like baldurs gate or neverwinter nights dungeon siege could very well be a mixed bag for you because the latter doesnt have the same depth of detail to character building
proceed with cautionits pretty easy to describe dungeon siege
its essentially diablo with less clicking a party of up to  characters and better graphics which means  it doesnt take much intelligence to play it and  youll play it until you realize youre wasting away from forgetting to eatthe biggest difference aside from the obvious graphical edge is the fact that the world is unchanging and absolutely gigantic
there are more places to explore than there are in baldurs gate and some of the dungeons are so huge itll take you an hour to walk from one exit to the other even if the monsters are all deadas noted previously the graphics are topnotch d and the engine in general is very streamlined and intuitive
i have noticed a few bugs here and there but the game itself is very stable and runs well
as in diablo there arent any tricks or puzzles to work though
if you explore everything youll probably find everything pretty straightforward
some battles are quite tough however and take a bit of fancy maneuvering to get byabout the only big nonbug complaint i have is that the ai is pretty stupid
if you send out one character all the enemies in a certain radius will attack that character and will not stop until they are incapacitated
this makes is possible to wipe out a massively superior horde of monsters by getting a bunch of archers or wizards and having one warrior lead the goons in circles around them
i really expected better from the likes of chris taylorai stupidity aside dungeon siege is definitely worth the money and worthy of the hype
for those who are tired of diablo  and dont feel like waiting another decade for diablo  go get this gameive been waiting for a good star wars rts game and this one is it
and its a very challenging game
there are many units  structures to build plus plenty of upgrades to strengthen your units
the story was ok but there werent any cutscenes and no music was playing while you were playing the game
it made it a little dullthe great thing about the game is for anyone who has played ages of empires ii this game looks and plays alot like aoe and also keeps score the same way
that was good and bad
good because the game was very easy to get the hang of and bad because i felt like i was playing aoe again but just set in the future
but the game looks good and plays very well
and with all the different units to build this game will give you many options in how you can go about trying to win
there are also some bonus maps where you can change the outcome of previous battles that were lost
theses battles are very hard and are worth the challengeand the whole gang was here
you get to play darth vader luke han chewie obiwan and many other characters
as far as rts games go this didnt bring anything new to the genre but it didnt take anything away either
it is definitley a worthy game and it will take you a while to beat it
some of the battles are ferocious and will take a long time to beat
others are lame
but all in all this game is very solid
may the force be with youwell i must say that this game is not going to push the envelope as far as graphics are concerned
the landscapes do look pretty good and the wildlife is cool
some will attack and some wont
its the way the troops move that is the downfall
they are a bit mechanical in their movement and they attack the same way each time they engage in combat
also the game is almost exactly the same as age  but with star wars units instead
nevertheless dont let this disuade you
its so much cooler to charge an enemy camp with storm troopers and at ats
i was getting tired of knights and elite skirmishers
this game was and continues to be real fun to play
i am a diehard starcraft fan and was searching for another addictive rts game
to be honest the only reasons for four stars instead of five and id actually give it  is when you select a formation and have it change direction itthe formation falls apart to totally regroup and if you were persueing an enemy they will usually escape also one thing i likes about starcraft that i miss is that there are limited resources
here as was in aoe you could keep pumping out the big units by trading at the market
i wish this was limited
it makes for better strategy and wiser use of forces
in real life you dont always have unlimited troops and such
other than these deficiencies the game really rocks and is very much a game that is replayable
i believe that you will really enjoy playing this game over and over
may the force be with youlet me preface my review by stating that i am an enthusiastic star wars fan and bought this game because of it
the gameplay is fun and interesting and the sw locals are great however when compared to aoe ii the game from which this is derived there is a slight lack of cohesion and balance
it is harder to find unit combos that work seamlessly together and there are too many topheavy units atat and the rebellion tank for example which dont cost enough to make it is very easy to build  atats and steamroller across a map
the flying units are a mere annoyance lacking any real power when faced with antiaircraft and a sheild generators and towers make uberstrong defensive combos that take eons to remove especially in the face of defensive siege weapon emplacementsto summarize this is a good game but if you are playing someone who has a similar skill level prepare to be playing a long timehaving played age of empires the games engine was all too familiar
there were jokes flying around about it was just a reskin
well thats partially true
most of the buildings are extremely similar in what they do actually almost all the building where you build air obviously is new but other than that all the buildings minerals and overall game play are essentially the samein aoe  there were over  different civilizations this has  i believe the rebels trade fed imperials wookies royal naboo and gugans
to tell the truth the only reason i played this was to send atats at gungans
it was fun till i realized you couldnt step on them each race pretty much is the same except for how the units look and special units
slight differences exist though imperial fighters dont get shields trade fed does not have to build shelters gugans can build shelters underwater i cant remember any othersoh welldealing with  resources is a pain seriously
and miners are rather slow
having to mine carbon food nova crystals and ore is annoying to say the least
whenever a worker isnt working a red button flashes until you send that peon to work
when your fighting it gets rather annoying
some units you would think should hit air and ground alot dont
also air units cannot be in the same x block in the air
the air is treated like ground where only a single unit can occupy that space unlike starcraft where air can stackthe game engine is very good seeing that it is the same exact one as aoetheres a campagin for each race except the gugans
in each you get to play with heros from the moviestrade federation attacking naboo and u get darth maul and lots and lots and lots of droidswookie driving off imperials slavers and trade federation rebuilding governement han chewie and a bunch of wookiesrebels follow the story line luke leia a jedi han etcgugans weird half is like  years ago then it jumps forward
uniting clans and killing droids boss nas amidala quigon obiwanimperials hunting rebels down
darth vadertheres also deathmatcher were u get lots of resources and fight to death
mounment where the first to build one wins no combatkilling the commander  straight forward standard where you can do almost all of the above to winthe game is good you get to use alot of starwars units and the sound and graphics arent badya like star wars 
ya like age of empires 
like the conquerors expansion 
well they combined star wars with the engine from aoe and blam ya got a fun game
no real suprises here just think of the conquerors with less civilizations and the star wars universe
the star wars maps like hoth tattooine yavin iv are very cool and a lot of fun to play
its a cool game for what it isif you like starcraft or warcraft or civ
than you will love this game especially if you like the star wars movies
it has all the basic gameplay of the previous games but this time you are playing with iconic favorite charactersthere are  species to choose from there are  very different ones in starcraft but the difference between each one in this game is barely any
if you can play one you can basically play all
personally i think the empire is the most fullfilling for a star wars fan to choose as it has atats tiefighters tieinterceptors tiebombers speederbikes and more
the rebels are missing the bwing awing and the millenium falcon itself is even missing as far as i can tell
the other thing that is really nice about this game is the variety of ways you can win a battle by destroying your enemy collecting jedi holicons or building a monument with mined resources
this along with the jedi characters alone open several options and potential strategies to this gamethe campaigns are great and you get to role play as your favorite characters and see the story from that teams povthe evil empire isnt so evil when you are vader
 but the true fun of the game is multiplayer
the game even comes with movie audio clips that you can use to taunt your friends during play
i have you now
id rather kiss a wookieeok this game isnt the bleeding edge or anything but after all the poor star wars games over the last couple of years it fills the void nicely after playing the demo i decided to give it a try and whattaya know its age of empirs with star wars units this game is fun
plain and simple
using a mixed company of wookies and jedi to take out atats and stormtroopers is really hard not to like
as an old aoe player it took me about  minutes to understand and interpret the new troops and buildings compared to their aoe counterpartsultimately fun is what its all about right
if you want to have fun building armies and beating up on gungans and stormtroopers this is the game for youfew things are cooler than building  atats and rolling in on some of those jar jar binks things and getting my slaughter on
of course the process that leads up to all of this is pretty tedious but in the end when im looking over the charred corpses of the vanquished and the burned out ruins that was once their home i feel satisfied
and you will too no matter what race you choose to be
but lets face it being the empire is the most fun
sure the movies taught us to cheer for the leftist crybaby rebellion but this game allows you to perpetrate all those atrocities that made the empire so popular among all the fictitious peoples of the galaxy
watching darth vader roll around choking the hell out of people is fun too even if you dont get to make him do itbasically this is aoe which is no surprise with sw units
very little has changed save for the fact that air units do change things a little
basically theyre useless as theyre so easily killed by antiair units
this strikes me as odd because most the movies revolve around air superiority
you really will have fun with this though and its pretty much worth the money youll spend on iti had a lot of fun playing this game
there really was only one problem
this would be that it is a total clone of age of empires  it is the aoe game engine set in a star wars galaxy
the units are exactly the same
for example there is a unit in aoe that is called the ram it is resitant to arrows and destroys buildings
in star wars there is a unit called a pummel
it is resitant to lasers and destroys sturctures
this sounds pretty similar right
i suggest that you buy age of empires and you love it to buy this game
you should try aoe out firstthose of you that had the displeasure of playing lucasarts first attempt at star wars real time strategy might be disinclined to take the bait a second time
you would be missing out however as galactic battlegrounds goes a good way towards making up for its abominable predecessor
while gb is definitely not an attempt to create a unique rts system at least it works which is far better than can be said about fcgalactic battlegrounds uses the aoe  engine and it plays a lot like age of kings
if youre experienced with the medievalera strategy game you probably wont even need to play the tutorial or read the manual
now before you run off and dismiss this game as age of kings with star wars sprites you should know that the star wars sprites are really quite cool
also the game actually does play quite a bit differently owing to the fact that almost all the units are ranged and there are air units
if you discount the last fact as i did at least once you risk the nasty surprise of having your opponent flatten your base with bombersanother one of the best things about battlegrounds is that it runs very smoothly over even a mediocre internet connection much like aoe  does
it also enjoys rocksolid stability and a few useful improvements over the old game engine
for example when you build a harvesting center the workers you used to make it will automatically start harvesting when theyre done building
also the idle villager button flashes when there is one so you dont have to keep clicking on it to find outof course nothing is perfect and although battlegrounds sure seems perfect in the light of its predecessor it could have been better
the graphics are only soso
i really think lucasarts could have done a better job with the blaster shots and explosions
they are all nonantialiased colored lines and white flashes the sort of thing youd expect a  year old with crayons to draw
this wouldnt be so bad if you werent always staring at them
i should also note here however that the graphics aside from scaling are arguably better than force commanders
this says a lot when you consider the fact that that game was d on another aesthetic note but hardly the least important one the original john williams soundtrack is retained in this game
if there is any immediate indicator that lucasarts has learned from fc and worked to amend its deficiencies this is it
also im sure many will agree that there could hardly be a be a better tune for playing against your best friend or kid brother than duel of the fates
another probable defficiency is that the game plays too much like age of kings
this goes down all the way to the scenarios which aside from different heroes run in a very similar fashion to the aoe  single player missions
the only real difference in the campaign is that each mission line has a bonus mission that plays out a hypothetical alternate battle
some of them are quite fun say the big slaughter of gungans including everyones favorite jarjar binks
if youve ever sadistically wondered how darth maul stacks up against him heres your chance to find out
you can also if youre good win the battle of hoth and generally make hay out of the canonical storyline
this is never a boring thing for a star wars fan to dothe established game engine certainly carries more advantages than disadvantages when you add them all up
it was definitely a good idea for lucasarts to license it
in fact its such a good idea that youll inevitably wonder why they didnt do this in the first place instead of going through all the trouble of making their own d engine no simple task only to have it eat the floorboards on store shelves
for those who played force commander and wish they hadnt i encourage you to give galactic battlegrounds a try
especially if you havent played age of empires before itll go a good ways towards fulfilling an aching need for some good star wars strategy gamingive only just finished playing the singleplayer missions about five minutes ago but i thought itd be reasonable to review it anyway
a lot of people remember the first jedi knight with a lot of affection
it was the very first game in which players could actually become a jedi and use a lightsaber
the singleplayer storyline was quite good although i personally thought the filmed cutscenes were a bit weakits been quite a few years since weve seen a star wars singleplayer game so i was surprised and delighted when i heard that raven software would be developing a sequel to jedi knight entitled jedi outcast
so is it worth buying
it depends  jedi outcast has exactly the same pros and cons as the original game did
so if you loved certain aspects of the original and hated others youll find yourself reacting the same way hereto start with  the bad points
if the jumping puzzles and mazelike levels really annoyed you the first time around things arent going to get any better the second time around
the worst part is during the levels in nar shadaa which are often set above vast bottomless chasms
some puzzles require exquisite timing and luck in particular a level in nar shadaa which requires you to leap onto a moving hovercar and then dodge a trash compactorin addition in the first five levels of the game you dont have either a lightsaber or any force powers
youre only equipped with runofthemill weapons
the level design in these first five levels isnt all that great either
i suspect that raven software created these first five levels as a homage to the original dark forces pc game  if so it was a poor choicethe other important point to mention is that you will need a fast pc in order to play and enjoy this game
i have an amd athlon  xp with mb pc ddr ram and a mb geforce ti videocard
its quite a powerful system and i can run the game at x at the highest detail levels without a single framerate slowdown
i would not recommend running this game on anything less than a pentium iiiamd thunderbird  ghz pc
the big payoff is that the graphics are jawdroppingly awesome
again the cloud city levels are a beautiful example of this  you really will believe that youre in a star wars movienow the good points which more than outweigh the bad
it takes about two hours or less to play through these first five levels
the level design also improves considerably with the cloud city levels being my personal favourite
you also finally get access to your force powers and then your lightsaber
the tutorial mission on level  demonstrates just how much the force powers have improved over the original jedi knight
the old abilities are all here but given a brand new twistfor instance in the original the only really useful power was force pull which you could use to pull weapons from enemies hands
this time you have both force push and force pull and both are quite dangerous
force push can be used to actually knockdown enemies from a distance while force pull can be used to physically drag enemies towards you
as you progress through the game your force powers will increase
at full power force push can be used to fling an entire platoon of stormtroopers into a chasm which is a truly awesome sight to beholdthe other great aspect about this game is undoubtedly the lightsaber combat
obviously the original jedi knights lightsaber combat was based on the first three films and it mostly consisted of frenetically waving your lightsaber around
jedi outcasts lightsaber combat was based on the newer films which means that using your lightsaber involves more than just repeatedly pressing the fire button on your keyboardput it this way  anyone whos watched the phantom menace will remember the truly awesome fight between obiwan kenobi and darth maul
they will also remember the combat moves they were able to execute which included somersaulting off walls
well know you will also be able to execute the same moves and it looks and feels absolutely awesome
one of my own favourite moments came during a cloud city level when i was locked in combat with a dark jedi and a hapless stormtrooper
i actually managed to kill both the other jedi and the stormtrooper at the same time  and the game actually went into slow motion replay to show me the death scene
coolnesswith both jedi outcast and elite force raven software have proven that they are a highquality development company who are quite successful at bringing legendary bigscreen adventures to the pc
i believe that raven software were probably the best and most likely only company that couldve pulled this off
this game is a classic and i would certainly not hestitate to recommend this game providing the person in question has a reasonably fast pcthis is the best star wars game i have played
except for a few missteps with level design and puzzles this game is very engrossing
the main story is about a jedi who has to rediscover his powers in order to deal with a dark jedi who is trying to take over the galaxy i think
its a rather cliche tale but one that works well in the star wars universe created in this gamegameplay ill say this upfrontif this game did not include such excellent lightsabre combat and force powers it would be a very average firstperson shooter
however since the jedi abilities and signature weapon are showcased prominently throughout most of the game jedi outcast stands above most games ive played
unlike the recent star wars movies episodes i and ii where the lightsabre battles are great but there are not enough of them to save the movies from their mediocre scripts jedi outcast really lives up to its goal of making the player feel like a jedi
youll have to get through the first five levels of the game in which you wont have your sabre or the force powers
however levels  are all about mastering the force and elegantly dismembering your opponents with some truly gorgeous swordplay
i am not a big fan of shooter games but i found this one fairly easy to learn
there are a good variety of weapons from laser rifles to bombs
nonetheless you will probably be using the lightsabre most of the time since it is so versatile
the sword fights look very authentic and true to the star wars films
you can switch between stances strong medium or fast deflect laser fire throw your sabre and use it in conjunction with force powers like force grip and force push
even though you will probably find yourself frantically clicking the mouse and various keyboard bottons hoping that you can outfence other jedi the sabre fighting never looks awkward or mechanical since the game finesses the motion of the lightsabre to make attacks look elegantly lethal
i didnt intend to go on for so long about just the lightsabre aspect of the game but i found this part to be very well implemented and entertaining all the way to the end
the force powers are also well done but youll probably find yourself using only a few of the  available on a regular basis
my favorites were force heal and force grip but there are others like force speed jump pull push lightning and mind trickin addition to the lightsabres and force powers the game includes a host of friendly and hostile individuals and creatures including hordes of stormtroopers a few species of aliens a few dozen dark jedi the best opponents and a few familiar faces like luke skywalker and lando calrissian
generally welldone cutscenes help advance the plot between levels
level design is good overall but this game includes more than its fair share of places where you can get stuck looking for passages switches keys and other things
there are a lot of jumping sequences several of which are tough
i only had to use a walkthrough guide once to find a passageway in one of the early levels
however in  hours of total gameplay i spent at least  of those hours trying to figure out where various passages doors and switches were
this will be frustrating to many gamers and is the main reason i cant give this game  stars
technically the game is very stable and i didnt experience a single crash or bug which seems rare for games nowadaysgraphics this is a very beautiful game
outdoor scenary is especially convincing as is combat particularly lightsabre duels
characters move realistically during the game but they appear much stiffer and unpersuasive during cutscenes
the game looks like an authentic star wars worldsound no problems here
all weapons sound like you would expect from the sonic whiz of laser fire to the low humming of a lightsabre
ambience noises are appropriate where they appear and the voice acting is good
the familiar movie music greatly contributes to the star wars feel of the gameoverall this game is a very good buy especially at the current price
its engrossing stable and straightforward regarding controls
again some people will be put off by some of the more tedious findtheswitchdoorpassagekeyjump sequences which are generously sprinkled throughout the game
however if you can get pass these annoyances jedi outcast is a real treat for star wars fans and others alikerating  out of  starshave you ever wondered what it would be like to be a jedi  a light saberwielding laser blastdeflecting fastrunning highjumping mindtricking acrobat of mayhem
jedi outcast is the closest thing that you will get to finding out
this isnt really a firstperson shooter its a firstperson jedi game
its very unique and it has a little something for everyone
if you are not turned off by the insane difficulty of this game then you will probably enjoy it no matter what kind of game you usually likefirst off if you are a big star wars fan then you will start to like this game right away
its true to the movies in just about every way
it starts off like a star wars movie with the rolling text that introduces the storyline
you will recognize the laser blast and the light saber sounds from the movies and most definitely the music
i just wish that they could have gotten mark hamil to voice act luke skywalker
the light saber tactics and force powers are what make this game special
i love running into a room full of storm troopers with light saber unsheathed and flipping around and hacking them before they know what hits them
the force speed power lets you temporarily slow down the rest of the world ala max payne
force push knocks a group of baddies onto their rumps so that you can rush in and take care of them before they get back on their feet
you can also push them off of high ledges into deep gaping holes of death lots of those in this game
force pull pulls their weapons out of their hands
if you want you can pull the weapons from everyones hand and then throw your light saber like a boomerang and cut them down
its such a blast cutting stormtroopers and imperials to pieces with your immense jedi powers
it never gets oldthere are a ton of good puzzles in this game
this game has more good puzzles than most puzzle games
i was very pleasantly surprised by this
lots of them are fairly easy but there are some very tough ones in there as well
you really have to exercise your brain to get through this game
i had to use a walkthrough posted on the internet several times
there are a lot of secret areas in the game as well and a lot of little buttons and stuff to push
if you are someone who likes to go exploring around big d maps then you will enjoy exploring the jedi outcast worldi must say though i didnt like the controls for this game very much
kyle cant jump and pull himself up onto a surface ala thief and he skids to a stop like his shoes are covered in grease
this makes the numerous jump puzzles in the game annoying
i found myself overrunning doors and computer consoles a lot of the time too and taking a couple of seconds to properly position myself to get through a doorway
the light saber controls werent very good either especially when it comes to dueling
the light saber duels arent what they are hyped up to be
they look and sound cool they flash by at lightning speed and its next to impossible to tell what is going on
the enemy has no health meter and kyle your protagonist doesnt autoface the enemy
the opponent usually flies and jumps around like yoda in attack of the clones
its very hard to tell what you are doing right and what you are doing wrong
i never used the special light saber moves in the game
instead i found that the best way to win light saber battles was to use force speed and furiously click the attack button
there are improvements to be made herethe biggest downer in this game is the insane difficulty level
and i mean insane even on the second easiest setting
i rarely played this game for more than five minutes without dying and having to reload my saved game
the game lacks flow because of it
there are snipers in this game that hit you from half a mile away if you pop your head out for only half a second
there are lot of areas in the game where you have to complete  nearly impossible tasks in a row within  seconds or you die
i used the cheats to get past one of these after trying about  times
this is the first game that i have ever cheated to finish a game
i died about  times before finally vanquishing one big boss with a light saber
i dont think that a game should be a piece of cake but on a lower difficulty setting you shouldnt be wearing out the quick save and quick reload keys on your computer either
some people might like it that way
it just depends upon your personal preferencethe good parts of this game override the shortcomings by a long shot
go out there and buy it and wait like me for the next sequelall in all the best star wars game there is
ive just completed the single player game and i found it very well layed out
good graphics and sound
enemy ai has also been greatly improved here
the settings are true to star wars style although most of them are not from the filmsthe first  missions are not so good because you dont get to use force or lightsaber
the storyline does explain why that is but its still a drag
the levels themsevles are good thoughafter that you go to yavin to get force and training on the temple grounds
you also get to meet some star wars characters herethen things get brilliant
after that you get to go to nar shaddar city to get reelo
great level but could have done with some ordinary civilians ambling in the streets for realismthen off to bespin
this is the best mission
very true to the filmthen the cairn instilation and doomgiver ship
great level design but too repetetive
then finaly back to yavin for final battle
this is a nice level great jungle and temple scenery
but the jungle lacks animals
you can hear them though
you also get to fight alongside luke and some others as you approach your nemesissadly the multiplayer has very poorly done out levels
they lack so much in design and atmosphere that you need lots of players to make it worth iteven if your not a star wars fan youll like this gamewithout doubt this is one of the best star wars games ever made second only to rebellionthe book centres around the story of kyle katarn the main character of the dark forcesjedi knight series
kyle and his partner jan are up to old tricks and are this time investigating some imperial trouble for mon mothmathe story itself i found to be tripe which is why i gave this game  and not  stars
but nevertheless i will explain it
after some initial probing missions kyle comes across an imperial conspiracy with a dark jedi who plan to do some very evil thingslater in the game something happens to a close friend of kyles something that prompts kyle to return to the valley of the jedi to regain his jedi powers
after this kyle gets his lightsabre back and his force powers continue to grow as he searches for the answers to the various puzzles until the game comes to a predictable yet satisfying endingthe game is a gem of a first person shooter and incorporates many traditional weapons such as the stormtrooper blaster wookie bowcaster and thermal detonators
however after the first few levels kyle recieves his lightsabre and this is where the game really begins to shinethe best part of the game for me were the lightsabre battles
with such realistic graphics and sound effects i really understood what it was like to be luke during his final confrontation with vader
i have played the game through twice and plan to do so againevery star wars fan should own this game it is simply the besti am not a huge star wars fan and loathe the last two films in the series by lucas
but this old school star wars epic game takes you back to the late seventies and early eighties classics with its environments characters and musicthe puzzles are annoying at times and although logical can be hard to figure out without some help
later on in the game they get a bit easier and more intuitive though and when you obtain the light saber after going through the various trials the game really takesoffluckily the puzzles add to the game rather than take away from it and add more than just point and shoot action like most fps gamesthe levels are huge dark and scream star wars at every turn
youll see a number of familiar characters such as greedos race luke skywalker atats xwing fighters tons of wonderfully rendered stormtroopers and their officers among othersthe music is classic star wars fare with booming theatrical sound and increases in intensity as the action picks up depending on what you are doingthe lightsaber is so much fun as you can go through most of the game using it to slay tons of enemies or focus on your weapons if youd like
there are trip mines a sniper gun an automatic laser weapon and many other gadgets to work with
then there are the force powers choke holds push and pull and force speed all which are incredibly well done and add even more to the already varied arsenal of weapons and options at your disposal
the first time i put a choke hold on a poor sap then quickly did a force push on him in midair watching him fly screaming over an edge into oblivion i felt like standing up and applaudingyou really do feel as though you are in an oldschool star wars movie and unlike the previus jedi knight games raven has used the latest quake iii technology to render great looking models and textures that bring it all to life on your screenthe story is meaningful and well done driving you to the end of the game to see what happens
and billy dees cameo appearance and voice overs are a treat as wellif you like actionfps games this one is easy to recommend
and if you grew up watching star wars movies you are in for a real treatstar wars jedi knight ii jk is the longawaited sequel for what many consider one of the best star wars games ever brought to a pc
the game begins with the same character in the original game who is now a mercenary that has decided to give up the force
as the levels progress your character becomes entangled in a web of jedi conspiracies and once again picks up his lightsaber to battle the bad guysone difference between this and the original game is that all force powers are available for your character
in the first game you choose your destiny and which side of the force you want to pursue as some powers are only available with evil jedis and vice versa for good jedis
in jk all jedi powers shown in the movies are available to your character which probably doesnt keep with the star wars storyline but makes for a more enjoyable gamethe graphics and sound in jk are on par with the times but not spectacular
one of the biggest disappointments to me were the small movies inbetween levels which i felt had poor graphics especially when compared to the first game which had real life actors play the parts
one element many first person shooter fps fans pay attention to is the ai of computer controlled opponents
jks ai is decent but nothing special
the  jedi opponents are rather stupid but still fun to play against and the game does a good job of making the jedis smarter and stronger as the game goes on
sometimes the game allows you to sneak up on stormtroopers and other enemies but overall the enemies dont have much personalityits hard to give jk a fair review because i love the movies and get a kick out of any game that allows me to wield a lightsaber
all things being equal its one of the better fps games available at the moment but probably not the best
you will enjoy your time with this game but it probably wont be your alltime favoriteaction fans    stars  regardless of how much you enjoy the star wars universe this is a quality fps and will eat up time
that being said gamers will probably cherish jk more if they love watching the star wars movies
because the game uses force powers in addition to weapons it would be wise to own a mouse with several buttons and a scroller if youd like to avoid pressing a lot of keysstrategy fans    stars   some of the press releases for jk stated that more strategy would be required for the sequel
the strategies though arent really antyhing more though than typical fps puzzles push the right buttons find secret areas match the right keys etc
strict strategy lovers probably wont find much in jkadventurerpg fans   stars  there are some elements of an rpg in jk as your force powers progressively increase and the storyline is entertaining
its still a fps game though and if you dont enjoy these types of games you probably shouldnt give it a try unless you are a star wars fanx factor  a history of poor star wars pc games   stars  there have been a few quality pc games based on star wars like the xwing series and the original jk
unfortunately they were released several years ago
jedi knight ii is probably the first pc game in some time to capture the magic of the famous films it is based on
nothing beats a game that lets you control a fighting jedi to the sound of john williams classic scorebugs    stars  relatively bug free
i experienced a few crashes mostly in the multiplayer mode but not enough to take away from my enjoyment of the gamereplay value    stars  if you compare jedi knight ii to other pc games it has great replay value mainly because its a fps game which usually entails a fun online multiplayer mode and a healthy community of gamers ready to make custom files for the game
because of a large star wars fan following jedi knight ii already has an impressive amount of mods skins and other custom files available for download on the web at various fan sites
also jk uses the quake engine which many gamers are familiar with so the game promises to have a healthy amount of custom maps released in the near future even without an official editor
one problem i had with jks multiplayer mode was that the maps for multiplayer arent as fun as other games ive played
deathmatches and capture the flag are classic styles of play for fps games both are in jk but they have gotten boring as more games are released with objective maps
to me deathmatches dont stand up to objective maps maps that have specific goals each team much complete before the game is over for replay value
probably the most enjoyable type of game included in jk is the duel match
on these maps players battle each other oneonone and the winner remains to face the next person in line
it can be tedious waiting for your chance to play but they are the perfect types of matches for a game like jk that relies on lightsabers
the maps are fun the weapons and force powers make for enjoyable hours regardless of which type of game is played but to me something is missing in jks multiplayer
judging by the amount of mods and other files already released by gamers in jks first month of release there should be plenty of free extras available for download in the near future which will keep the game enjoyablein the old dayshow old lucas arts did all the development for star wars contents but i guess lucas arts were good at adventure genreand still is and will bebut at other genre so lucas arts alone werent enough to handle all those various types of star wars contents and all those fancy movie things that need to converted into polygons
so i guess that made lucas arts to let other developer companiesravenbarrentbioware etc
to put their own pro genre into star wars and give players a much better star wars experiencethis is one of the game born because of lucas artss decision that i explainedwhat is goodgreat grahpics its hard to describe the great graphics but when you play its hard to find slowdownsi use a riva tnt and didnt find much slow downsenemy hacking bullet flying no time for stopping gameplay this star wars is all about actionyou dont really need to worry about your health because you can charge it up to max with your force thing and laser blasters even have machine gun mode and ammos are almost always found in enemy weapons and if you dont wont to get hurt in the middle of a crossfire
just use your lightsaber like carzy and buzz around like a mouse
just a jokegreat level design need wordswhat  is badnot much lightsaber tricks swing
boomerang and what elsetoo action too action sometimes mean repetative make sure you get the demo before you purchaseoverall great star wars game but if playing simsrct are games that just right for your mind this game wont be funi got this game almost when it first came out but my video card was to bad to run it properly
so i eventually got a new video card a more ram and it works fine until i get to a big area
i am above system requirements
pentium    mb ram nvida geforce  video card yet it can vary from  to  frame per second
well it seems cool but i stopped playing it because of the performance
i hope to play it again when i get my new computer soon
the system requirements should recommend higher than they do
but if you have a p or better  mb ram or more and a mb video card or better this gae should give you many hours of funstar wars jedi knight  jedi outcast overall is a mindblowing experience which will go above and beyond expectations which you may have set for it
the reason why this game didnt score a  in my book probably would be because after finishing the single player mode  the game may leave you wanting more
this flaw didnt bother me much at all because the multiplayer mode for this game is fantasticpros great multiplayer there is nothing like getting out your lightsaber and taking out your anger on helpless enemies by tearing them to bits online against many players the force powers the force powers used in this game add a special touch to the gameplay in single and even multiplayer modes overall good effectsgraphics in my opinion these graphics are good although they still could be better storylineplot i know some gamers who played this game didnt like this feature i personally though felt jedi outcast had a strong and interesting story behind it an array of weapons  who could forget a lightsabercons movievideo clips the video clips in between the game werent great i felt the first jedi knight game utilized this feature better w using live actors single player mode i know many people may disagree but i felt the single player mode could of been a little better
im not saying that it was bad acutally im saying the opposite of that but its not perfect
but really  what game is perfectsomeuplucasarts and raven studios overall have done a terrific job on not a perfect but solid and fun star wars gamealthough im not a nutcase star wars fan that attends every convention and dresses up like a wookie i am nevertheless a fan of lucas brilliant saga
i enjoy the movies and when jedi knight  was released i eagerly picked up a copy for my pc
and if youre a fan of star wars and you like the idea of becoming a jedi then i urge you to pick this one upalthough the first couple of levels are a little boring the locales are very star warsish and killing tons of stormtroopers has never been more fun
quests of the puzzlevariety are abundant in the first few levels but once kyle katarn the hero you control meets up with luke skywalker and arms himself with his trusty lightsaber the game really takes off
an intuitive mousecontrol attack makes the saber flow like a true jedi and rooms of intergalactic bounty hunters are soon cut to shreds with powerful jumping attacks backslashes and somersaults that sever limbs beautifully
plus kyle can now wield the force with cruel proficiency
abilities like force pull and push can mean instant death for imperials standing high atop a catwalk and the crackling smell of death in force lightning is a sight to behold as you lash out before slicing a jedi reborn in two
as vader says all too easy
the graphics are incredible but know this without a powerful pc this game may not run as smooth as you like
of course turning down a lot of the eyecandy will help but for those of you with a chunky graphics card and a smokin system are in for some real dazzling effects and landscapes
gorgeous visuals shape the universe from cloud city to the seedy cantinas
cutscenes are handled nicely with decent voice acting and some goodlooking rendering effectsas for the sound get ready to be immersed in blaster fire frenzy
thanks to a recent patch jkii allows owners of audigy soundcards to crank up the effects with eax sound which really adds a tremendous amount of realism to the game
stormtroopers chat while guarding that alltooimportant outpost and youll be able to recognize where the blaster fire is coming from thanks to fully recognized  support
the familiar whirr of the lightsaber is enough to warrant purchase of this oneand also know this the game aint easy
on numerous occasions youll find yourself surrounded by dozens of enemies all firing away with their trusty sidearms or tossing some nice thermal detonators your way
needless to say youve got to have pretty quick trigger fingers yourself to avoid countless reloadsfor the entire package jedi knight ii is a game that should not be missed especially for fans of firstperson shooters or the star wars saga
wielding a lightsaber has never been more fun and when you enter the multiplayer world that jkii has to offer you can test your skills against thousands of jedi in a oneonone arenain terms of action graphics sound and overall fun jkii does not disappoint
although it takes a little while to get into once you do youll be sad to see it endwith out a doubt this is the most fun and immersive fps since halflife
while that might sound groundbreaking it isnt
it feels more like  of what it might have been and that would have made it an instant classicmost of the action is a blast
a favorite part of mine was later in the game you enter an open courtyard in cloud city
with out warning a pair of dark jedi attack
the following battle is a frenzy of crackling lightsabers and clashing force powers
yet moments like this take time getting therefor the first few missions you wonder around looking for the right button to hit while fighting a seemingly infinite army of stormtroopers
it is strange that a game still makes button flipping a major game play aspect
nor is your destination always clear some levels are a maze at times
on top of that you do a lot of jumping
a lot after awhile it reminded me of frogger
it is here that the flaws of the game are the most obvious
the ai is not stupid but not clever either
some of the graphics are very good like the character models lighting shadows and weapon effects
however much of the textures are lower resolution and bland
there is only a sky box no sky effects making the outdoor areas lifeless
oddly absent is the detailed mapping that the quake engine is known for
yet once you are strong with the force it is a blastasecond to throw stormtroopers off a cliff choke imperial officers to death and cut down dark jedi
it never gets old to fry blast blow up and vaporize hordes of bad guys right out of the moviesi was surprised to find an interesting plot in the game
in a nutshell it is another attempt by a crazy dark jedi and an imperial faction to overthrow the republic
however there were some plot points that i did not expect and made it worth following along
more than that the voice acting was better than most computer games
it was entertaining to listen to the dialog as each charactor hade a perfectly matching voicewhile the voice acting was well done the music needed some polishing
the classic star wars score is over used
it is used in every single star wars game to date would it hurt to come up with something newthe single player is entertaining but i found the mutiplayer to be less thrilling
some will find it awsome but in games with out force powers or limited power it boils down to the same old runn gun
a little less conformity and more innovation would have made it worth while in my opinion
mp is also played out on the msn zone also in my opinion a hasselover all it is still the best star wars game to come out since the previous jedi knight
it is a cool game and one of the best to come in a while
yet the uninspired mp and sometimes irritating level design weaken what could have been amazing gameno library would be complete without this gameit has some of the original cast with great graphics and story linesome scenes were a little choppy but nobodys perfectgraphics soso but plays well story line good action good but can get boring running around looking for objects and rooms for unlocking game playjedi knight outcast is the third of firstperson shooter games set in the star wars universe that began with dark forces  and continued into jedi knight or jk 
as before you become kyle katarn  an eximperial commando turned mercenary rebel scout and jedi
although outcast has the action and puzzles combined with sound and graphics faithful to star wars of the older games it ramps up the action with the quakeiii arena engine with harder puzzles and longer and more complex levelmaps than before
puzzles are more counterintuitive enemies fiercer coordination requirements more precise and some mission demands much moredemanding
in short unlike other games outcast has some stiff hardware requirements for you not jut your pcstory  if you played jk and decided not to play as a dark jedi you may recall saving the valley of the jedi from evil
now working for the new republic nee rebellion and having renounced the force katarn and the lovely jan ors weed out pockets of eximperial forces called the remnant
enroute to infiltrating a remnant stringhold kyle and jan are warned of remnant interest in the valley of the jedi
soon they learn that galak fyar a remnant boss is allied with a dark jedi named desann
desann finds the valley and uses it to empower an army of warriors called reborn
katarn follows this combined enemy from an imperial prison to nar shadaa a sort of interglactic truck stop from the lofty plazas of bespins cloud city to the labyrinthine interior of a remnant stonghold hidden in an asteroid belt
eventually youll return to yavin four the moon that hosted a hidden rebel base in the first sw flick now its home to the jedi academy
if you remember the first flick youll see that the game expands on the location while staying faithful to what you saw on screen
now katarn is forced to return and relearn the force but not before luke skywalker subjects him to an elaborate obstacle course one which tests your coordination and force powersdoes it rock
outcast is mindblowing but less of gaming or entertainment leap than jk was
much of jks appeal was its mix of both great gaming technology c  graphics and sound with a storyline that linked missions into a single plot like an interactive sw movie
outcast is more like dark forces  meandering back  forth from one planet to the next
while the organization of levels becomes more plotlike as outcast progresses levels themselves remain unstructured
the first level is a perfect example youve infiltrated a remnant base only to be told that you must explore it
explore
for what
its just an excuse to keep you prowling hallways killing stormtroopers nabbing powerups and pass keys
also the levels are so long its easy to lose focus making them seem as uninspired as one of those rd party levels that fans make and distribute on the internet
outcast is a long game  raven probably remembered the complaints they got aboutstar trek elite force their last quakeiii shooter
at a leisuerly pace i could finish stef in about a week
it took me over a month to complete outcast
how hard is outcast
lets just say it will severely test your resolve to stay out of cheat mode and away from wealkthroughs
besides the puzzles and coordination tests is it really that hard to walk along a ledge
 youll face hoards of enemies who fear no ewoks or turn yellow when you forceyank their guns away
stormtroopers in this game move fast laugh at blaster fire and wont die without some johnwoo style flying deathspin
these arent  model jedimindtrickprone troopers
step aside
i think not
there are also assassins who can snipe you from miles away and hoards of reborn who make every level a bosslevelbut does it rock
though harder and longer
 theres some imagination lacking
the graphics engine is great but its still another reiteration of quake and lets face it we got this game because we wanted to more of something weve already seen hundreds of times since the carter administration
outcast tosses in some new tricks  like being able to throw your lightsbaer around like captain americas shield but it all boils down to jk with better graphics
near the end when youre depositited back on yavin  the game pulls out all the stops yavin  is a world of swamps and canyons which creates challenges unlike anything youd have seen in the rest of the game you must fight your way through a remnant armored assault to get back to the jedi academy  you get to drive an imperial scoutwalker  the games only driveable vehicle adding vehicles might have conjured up bad memories of rebel assault or rogue squadron
confronted with yavin  i had to wonder why they waited til the end to notch things up to 
outcast tosses in only a few sw characters  luke skywalker but mostly in cutscenes lando calrissian has a more substantial role  good choice there he was sorely underused in the movies while his appearance here is a prelude to the bespin level  my personal fave
the game also uses the ingame engine for cutscenes junking the fmv scenes of the last game
most players hated the fmv but i loved them  it was like a preview of a longwaited sw movie
the scenes looked cool and that was before we had phantom menace to compare them to
in short not a game that will completely make you forget jedi knight but one that will keep you too busy to remember it that much
i ran this game on my pghz system with winxp and a geforce card and it ran smooth as butter
not all opengl graphics cards are supported  check las website before you buy this gamei think it is a great game and i will eventually own more of the pokemon gamesthis is by far one of the greatest games to be released ever
it may not have super fancy graphics or a shocking deep storyline but pokemon had its own unique charm that everyone can lovepokemon are mysterious creatures that live on earth or possibly an earthlike planet
each of them had unique and extraordinary powers
currently there are at least  species of pokemon and about half of them live in johto and kanto combined
those are the regions the game takes place in if you didnt knowwhile the graphics arent they have their own style using pixel pictures called sprites
plus the game was made a good few years ago so you cant complainyou start out as a young pokemon trainer male or female named thats right you can choose your own name too
my example trainer for today will be a girl named kriskris soon embarks on a journey collecting gym badges to prove that she has what it takes to become a pokemon mastersoon kris will encounter a boy named 
guess what
you get to name your rival as well
cool
ill call him silver
silver is a trainer whom kris will battle often in her journey who often caused trouble around johto
silver is a headstrong trainer who is not above abusing his pokemon and he is tough to beat so make sure you level up your pokemon oftenthere are hundreds of types of pokemon waiting to be caught so there are many many varieties
im sure theres at least one pokemon out there thatll catch your interest
get it
catch
and its pokemon
catch
do you get itokay ill shut up now
plus the more you battle with pokemon the more they like you
theres a girl in a city called goldenrod who can tell you how much your pokemon likes you
it doesnt really add anything to the story or lack thereof as the whole game is pretty nonlinear its still cool to see whether your pokemon loves or despises you
certain pokemon can only evolve through friendship as wellthere is also a subplot in pokemon crystal involving a man named eusine and a legendary pokemon named suicune
i wont spoil anything other than the fact that you will team up with eusine occasionally and eventually battle him
plus there is the added bonus of a chance to battle suicune
and if youre lucky capture
raising befriending and of course battling pokemon is what it takes to become a pokemon master
the battles for any concerned parent are not violent and despite what those antipokemon idiots claim pokemon are not forced to fight and for crying out loud pikachu is not the second coming of evil
if you have no idea what im talking about look around some of those antipokemon sites and see
or perhaps dont
a wise quote from an ingame characterpokeacutemon are not tools of war  the elderso to summarize my whole review in a sentencebuy this awesome gamepokemon crystal version is very funyou have more secret to discoverif the pokemon fan want to play a game from the second generation i say play pokemon crystal this is the best of allthis game has the best graphics for a pokemon gameboy color game but you cant play it on your super gameboy like most of the pokemon color games
it also has a new feature battle tower
pokemon games are like a puzzle rpg adventureyet another development on the previous pokeacutemon games for the game boy series pokeacutemon crystal has not disappointed
it has new and improved graphics new animation and finally a girl character  woohoo
you can choose between the boy and the girl however the only difference is the appearance of your character
the way people talk to you and the storyline does not change
this game is very similar to its immediate predecessors gold and silver
one major difference however is that you get a good shot at capturing suicune without looking for it in the grass and you also get little markers on your map showing you the other  legendary beasts current locations if you have been lucky enough to spot them once
my only complaint about this game would be that as having played these games since redblue were popular and almost impossible to get i am getting burnt out
it is beginning to be the same old thing over and over
i remember when red blue and even yellow version used to keep me entertained for hours but when gold and silver came out it was beginning to get tiresome
i have not even bothered to beat crystal just because i know it will be the same ending
anyways its a good game overall so try it if youre not already bored with the gamesa fun game
especially if youre into pokeacutemon a bunch of new advancements from gold and silver though same story idea
play as boy or girl and you and your pokeacutemon fight to be the bestpokemon crystal version is a good game but too similar to gold and silver to be a musthave game unless you dont have either of these games or you just need to complete your pokemon collectionin this review i would also like to clear up a few false rumorsin the american version you cannot catch celebi
the game also does not have mobile phone capabilitiesthis was featured in the japanese version of the gamebut it was withdrawn from the american versionthere are a few quotcrystalclearquot differences from this game and the gold and silver editionsyoull notice these differences as you playas i mentioned before this game is not recommended to anyone who already owns gold andor silver versionbloody roar  is pretty cool
it plays almost exactly like the original bloody roar but with better graphics and its also a lot faster in gameplay the fighting is incredibly fast facedthe super moves are really cool to watch and all out this game was pretty good
i have to admit i wasnt impressed with the long boring endings that made very little sense to me
the only other thing that bothered me slightly was the games fast paced fightingnow i realize that i said that the faster game part was a good thing but its also a bad thing
the reason i think its a bad thing too is because now any series of strikes and special moves can become a vicious combo making it very difficult to make a comeback or a return onslaught to your opponentthe other thing that might bother others is the replay value because there isnt much
there is the story mode and then there is the survival mode
after that theres really no where else to go unless you and your friends have a versus mode battleeven so if youre considering a different kind of fighting game seriously consider this one because bloody roar  will really challenge you
have funthe first rank of fighting games and the select group of developers that make them is defined very clearly in this day and age
ask more or less anyone and they will tell you there is namco there is am there is team ninja and then there is everybody else
or to put it more appropriately there is nobody else
tekken soul calibur virtua fighter and dead or alive have captured the lions share of the attention in the genre since the peak of the playstation era when doa came out of nowhere to become a recognized contenderwhich bloody roar never quite was
raizings lycanthropic fighter had two outings on the playstation both localized by sony and met respectably at the box office but the franchise never seemed to earn the respect that dead or alive pried loose from the market and that tekken and virtua fighter seemingly possessed by default
doas nextgeneration debut received a flurry of hype and anticipation while the eventual arrival of bloody roar  on system  and ps barely raised eyebrows
unfair
to a degree
bloody roar  is not the toetotoe equal of soul calibur or tekken tag tournament and its not as ambitious as doa in some ways but its undeniably fun as a solo or multiplayer game and every so often it throws out a moment of serious graphical flair
its certainly worthy of its american release which has come thanks to activision and its worth the attention of those looking for something offbeat in a fighting gamebloody roars gimmick is the inclusion of monstrous alter egos for each of its characters  the werewolfs the cover boy but theres also the wereleopard the werelion the weretiger the wererhino beetle and something called the unborn the definition of which has never yet been satisfactorily explained
the cast runs the gamut of visual and technical fighting styles both in and out of their bestial forms which they can swap between almost at will
quotalmostquot is the kicker though
the games chief strategic element involves managing the energy meter that allows the transformation and knowing when to use the extra attacks that it enablessee characters can fight in human form but not nearly as effectively as when theyre packing giant fangs and sharp claws or antennae or giant prehensile spiky things or floppy ears and a cotton tail
beast form enables stronger combos and you can sacrifice your entire store of beast energy on the gamble that as a massive beast drive  hit or miss you return to human form but its worth it if you can land in excess of  hitsoffensively then bloody roar  has a lot of flash and a reasonable amount of depth
the combo scheme should be familiar to someone with a grasp of dead or alive or the more basic elements of tekken  characters have a decentsized selection of attacks based on directional movements and the two attack buttons with preset combos generally ranging from two to six hits although a few stretch up to eight or so lowpower strikes
like doa though linking attacks is generally determined by the canned strings or by staggering your opponent which works more or less as in doa
theres a little less emphasis on developing original combos although you can still devise some very clever linked attacks by studying how the stagger system works and what effect the walled arenas have on combatits the defensive system rather than the offensive system that feels a little less deep than some
bloody roar  includes a simple easytouse sidestepping system with up and down mapped to the lower shoulder buttons but its not the equal of the reversal scheme in doa or the complex parryreversalsidestep system that tekkens evolved over the years you havent seen real fighting sausagedom until youve seen someone chicken an attack in tekken tag
defense in fighters has evolved a lot in recent years and bloody roar  definitely feels a bit behind the curvethose gamers who are familiar with konamis other games will be in a for a real treat with this one
most of ephemeral fantasias problems arise from the fact that it wasnt created by sqauresoft
like suikoden the graphics arent stellar and the music gets a little repetitive but what it lacks in these areas it makes up for in involving storylines multiple outcomes an innovative and complex battle system and challenging realtime elements
the positive aspects to this game far outweigh the negatives
most of the complaints surrounding this title stem from the repetitive nature of the time loop and the fact that the game is hard
my response to the second complaint is that its about time we had a hard rpg for ps and that the games difficulty is mitigated by the very existence of the eversoannoying time loop
if you die the next week starts
yes you lose money and items but the monsters on the island drop tons of dough and you can always get the items again they even reappear in the exact same places you found them before
at least dying doesnt take away experience a la diablo ii or everquest
and you never forget moves or lose weapon upgrades
furthermore once you recruit a certain character the game provides you with a time vault that lets you stockpile a limited number of items and all the money you can find
i will say this though without a guide of some sort its almost impossible to get things done
this is a convoluted game
i get the impression that the us got a dumbed down version of the game which is funny considering how hard we seem to think it is
my overall conclusion a good rpg with a great storyline and finally
an interesting battle system
it starts out a little slow but if you make past week one this game is a gem
accept a challenge and pick this game upthese games are some of the best games ever seen in arcades
back in those days you had to rely on great gameplay not great graphics
of all the games on this cd tempest is my favorite
it is considered the most popular arcade game in history and i know why
but all the other games deserve mention too
centipede is a topquality shooter asteroids is another fun shooter with some nice vector graphics millipede is the sequel to centipede with tons of added features and more enemies gravitar is a very challenging game crystal castles is a fun game with fantastic isometric graphics a trackball or mouse should be used with crystal castles pong is the grandfather of arcade games its still very fun after almost  years and super breakout takes pongs quotball and paddlequot format to the next level in a very entertaining way
i think this is the only atari collection available for dreamcast so if you want classic atari games on dreamcast then get this quickartari
every gamer knows this legendary company by heart
because atari made the first game ever pong
and with pong came centipede asteroids tempest and many more
soon colcovistion and the dreaded nintendo would come along and boot artari out of bussnessbut their legendary games will live on forever
now thanks to infogames the legacy of atari lives on
now you can enjoy  atari classics on your sega dreamcast for one low price now keep in mind these games arent stateoftheart theyre graphics are not buffed out and the gameplay most of the time only requires the dpadanalog and the abutton
yes folks this is classic gaming at its best
while new gamers who started out playing games like metal gear solid will look at these games in disgust adult gamers who grew up with these game will relive their childhood memories one last timethe only real gripe i have with this collection is that the controller for the dreamcast is a little sensitive for these games and therefor will take time getting use to before you will actually sit down and enjoy the gamebut thats only a miner flaw
once you get the controlls down get ready to relive your childhood memories with atari aniversary editioni love this because it gives me the chance to play the old school games that i used to play on atarigameshark  let you enter codes that will unlock hidden features or give you extra bonus for ps games
new codes are added to their website each day and there are tons of them for each game
it is a great add on and will surely saves you tons of time and frustratingcouple bad things about it is that you need to use its cd to load it up each time and switch cds to play the real game later
and inputting code using the controller can get hard when you have tons of code to enter
have everything cheat in ffx has about  lines of code to enter each are  characters long so if you use it often you may consider buying the keyboard as wellhave you ever had one of those moments when youve played a whole game found yourself facing the very last boss and just as you reach for your swordwandray gun gotten blown clear into the next universe
repeatedly
have you ever had to spend two thirds of your game time leveling up and still found no way to get in more than two lucky hits
gameshark was made for those moments  it helps you cheatim not going to argue the ethics of deciding when you need a crutch
for some of us a little extra time and power to figure out what is going on and how to fix it is worth hours of frustrating or tedious game play
game play is about having fun not beating your head against the wall
gameshark is my last resort when i have spent an entire weekend trying to get past a single challengefor all its miraculous powers gameshark has some serious drawbacks
for one thing unless what you want is very straightforward it is difficult to use
to keep up with new games or extended cheats for old ones it is necessary to visit gamesharks web site any print out the new cheat codes
how to enter those codes is a both mysterious and clumsy
and if the dont seem to work it can be just as frustrating as getting stuck in the game can bewhen you finally master the clumsiness gameshark is often a game saver
and i guess that it keeps karma balanced if it is a bit of a challenge to cheat
the price is reasonable and this is the most versatile of the cheating tools available
just be prepared to read a manual full of tiny tiny printyou must be extremely careful when entering codes with this product and many cheats that adjust quotinventoryquot for your characters should be saved on a different save slot than your regular saves
the reason being is there often is a glitch in the saved game data while the gameshark codes for adjusting the inventory are on
i found it best to cheat the inventory save reset turn those inventory codes off and resumeloadif you intend to use this to move game saves around look somewhere else
an mb cartridge with  saves took forever to load the directory and another eternity to perform the requested operation
i have to mark off a point from perfection just for this performance issue alone
im using gs v
i also would encourage simply using the ps by itself to view dvds or get the sony dvd remote and software accessory
i dont believe the gs has any specific advantage to being used as a dvd playerif you dont have a lifetime to master the technique required to defeat a boss earn an item of equipment survive a specific challenge or progress past a certain point in the game this product enables you to get over these hurdles if in a somewhat technical sometimes confusing way
especially if its a game you have to enter codes for
entering digit hexadecimal numbers sometimes  of them at once to workaround your game problem can be a bit daunting
my wish is that they would allow you to burn a cd on a regular pc cdr drive that this product could read and use as an update to its code librarypacman is a legendary gaming character who is known for running around a maze being chased by ghosts all while eating pacdots
this game collection comes with  variations of the basic game and these variations are really quite funfirst you have the basic pacman
you are given a board to eat all of the pacdots on but of course there are four ghosts chasing you and if they touch you you lose a life
however if you eat a power pellet all of the ghosts become edible for a short amount of time and you are able to eat them forcing them to go back to their safe area in the middle of the board and change back to their regular selves
after you eat all of the pacdots on a board you move up to the next level which is always a bit harder but when you lose all of your lives its game over and to play again you have to start over from the beginning
this is the traditional pacman game that a lot of people came lovethe second game is pacman arrangement
this game is an updated form of the regular pacman game but everything moves a bit faster
you are able to move around faster but so are the ghosts
it also incorporates a bit of logic as it will add such things as warp zones or always edible ghosts into the gameplay but these things are explained as the game progresses
if a ghost touches you you still lose a life but if you lose all lives you are given the option to continue play where you left off only with your starting back at zero
also at the end there is a boss to beat making this game quite different from the regular game with a few similarities to keep the original pacman spiritfor the third game there is something called pac attack
now this is almost like tetris as you have to deal with ghosts and blocks falling from the sky
you can arrange them the way that you want to in order to be able to eat them when pacman falls from the sky
the goal is to get the blocks lined up in row which is when they will disappear and to get the ghosts where pacman can eat them all
its more of a puzzle game that requires a bit of fast thinking but it is still a fun gameand lastly there is pacmania
this game is much like the original pacman game only with a few small changes
first of all it is zoomed in a lot making it impossible to see the entire board at the same time
another change is that pacman is able to jump over ghosts
you have to time it perfectly because if pacman is just a little off he will lose a life due to the ghost touching him but it does add a possible way of getting away from ghosts
the power pellets of course are there too
this is almost exactly like the original game with just a few updates which makes it better in my opinionoverall this game collection is a fun assortment of games that are entertaining for all
my only problem would be that there arent enough games
i wish that a few more had been added but still the four games that are offered are really fun pacman games that id definitely recommend to anyone looking for some fun easy games to unwind withpacman collection consists of four pacman games pacman pacman arrangement pacattack and pacmania
three of these games are fun one is not
so i will review each of these games individually to give you a scoop about each game and and a score to go with itpacman score  out of what the game is if youre a smart gamer you should already know what this game is about
but if not ill give you an explanation you are a yellow round object sort of shaped like a pizza with a slice cut out and you go around mazes eating little dots all while trying to avoid being killed by enemies shaped like germs unless you get a power up to which then you can eat themgraphics it has an old bit look but the levels all look the same and nothing really seems to change when it comes to environmentsmusic the only time music is present is when you start another round but the small tune is okaysound the sounds of pacman eating dots and germs when they get turned blue the germs moving around and you dyinggameplay simple concepts of navigating the mazes and eating all of the dots as fast as you can controls work perfectly as any version of pacman ive playedoverall a title thats still a lot of fun despite its release more than twenty years ago but time has aged its old gameplay concepts and recycled levels which does damage part of the qualitypacman arrangement score  out of what the game is it follows the same pacman gameplay concepts you navigate around mazes you eat dots and germs when theyre in a current state and you get a lot of points for finding extra items
but this game is more addicting to play because of new colorful environments dd graphics there are six worlds to beat the game is more forgiving and some extra features in the mazes keep things freshgraphics a nice dd look especially for a game boy advance titlemusic again music only plays when you begin a new stagesound again like the original pacman eating germs moving and you dyinggameplay its a step above the original when it comes to new things no level is the same faster gameplay six worlds to beat a boss battle at the end and prettier graphicsoverall the game is almost perfect but its crippled by an overly forgiving continue system and constant death from germs like in the old pacman game
but its highly recommendable to anyone who likes pacmanpacattack score  out of what the game is remember tetris
its like that only minus the fun of tetris and it involves pacman characters and blocks in only one colorgraphics bland and distasteful especially considering this game was originally on the super nintendo a system with a lot of pretty d gamesmusic unimpressive and not a whole lotsound pacman eating germs when you line up blocks and germs in certain waysgameplay boring the block and germ destroying is very repetitive and not fun unlike most puzzle games
you have better options for game boy advance than thisoverall they should have put pacman  the new adventures in here instead of this mess
even though this game has little in common with pacmans original gameplay its a lot more fun than pacattack
and anyway pacattack has little in common with the other pacman games toopacmania score  out of what the game is it follows the steps of the original and arrangement in gameplay and environments
the gameplay feels a little old the graphics have a dd look and environments are recycledgraphics similar to arrangement only the environments arent as interestingmusic again not much like the original and arrangementsounds like the original and arrangement pacman eating germs moving and sounds of deathgameplay follows the original and arrangement but for some reason it feels somewhat boring unlike the latter games because of less interesting environments and the feel a little recycled along with some of the gameplayoverall enjoyable not the best game in this package but it does offer a good time for any pacman fansthis game could have been more but it came up short due to the lackluster mania and awful attack
namco should have whipped up more pacman games while they were at it because the score i gave this game would be improved and it would make it more attractive to buy
but this package as a whole is worth the investment to relive the old pacman glory dayswow
original pacman
no matter what you think of the other games here dont knock it
its frickin pacman
ok ok sorry
im gushing cuz i remember actually being able to play this in an arcade
god im old
lol  im cool with it
for you old enough to have been there buy this
nostalgia is a beautiful thing
for you young pups not sure what to tell you other than well you used to be able to go to a place called an arcade i know you had to leave the front of the tv hang out with your friends and play video games
it was a great way to throw away a fistful of quarters and not be sitting at home and still have an awesome timefor the price the game is amazing
the only reason that it did not get five stars is because of the full size screen was way too small to seefor several years i have played various versions of pacman games
whats included on this gba package isnt all that bad but i would have liked to see  additional installments  super pacman and jr pacman the former is included on namco museum megamix for the wii
however what is included is still goodpacman original  who doesnt get sick of playing this
all of the graphics and pacman sounds are faithfully intact
its still as hard as ever making it to the rd cut miniscene but once you do its a riot
pacattack  at first it is difficult to understand how the gameplay works so its probably best to start in puzzle mode
its great to have passwords included because some of the  puzzle levels are not easy
but the music is rather repetitious and doesnt change at allpacmania  this version is okay but the soundtrack has been edited
in order to hear the full versions you would have to play the unlockable versions on pacman world  or namco museum
but the graphics on the small screen are still easy to see and the fun doesnt stoppacman arrangement  this is the true gem of the collection
once you start you wont stop
everything about this version is spectacular
if you make it to the final level you will have a boss robot to defeat
unfortunately the only other console you would find this game on is the pspso overall not bad but as i stated could have fit in the other  pacman gamesit just surprises me when it really comes to video games these days
it all seems quite fancy with too much visual graphics that it really kills the enjoyment of classics
that does come into the cases with classics from the s that truly broadened the video game formatted market into a whole new level and beyond belief
that did come with the case of pacman
it truly was one of the very first revolutionary video game characters ever
the feeling of pacman still lingers on today
despite many people thinking of pacman as a throwback there is a simplicity to the puzzles and mazes that this yellow chomp has truly made in its long run and it fits just as well herethe pacman collection for the game boy advance is a collection of  of the classic games from the pacman library
the games in itself are a great feel to all different audiences of pacman and his supporting casts of ghosts inky blinky clyde sue and others just to name about
the games range from the tetrislike feel of pacattack which truly is one of the few games that really wasnt like pacman to the realism of the maze like the original version of pacman and one of the very first d games ever made pacmania to the ever changing realism of pacman arrangement
this particular game has just incredible graphics well beyond some other game boy advance games have been made since the game boy advance came into release in  still many people might be dissapointed with the absence of other great games missing from this collection including ms pacman super pacman pacman jr and pac man  which was released in  as the only unfortunate dud of the chomping legendalthough pacman is everywhere as a nostalgic throwback to the s many people might not want this version for the game boy advance
still pacman and his chomping impact are well worth the buck over here
if you have a game boy advance this game collection has to be one addition for the booksthis is easily the best college football game out there for any system
overall the game is a madden clone lookswise and gameplaywise
there are plenty of features that make this game stand on its own howevertheres amazing attention to every detail for every team
from the uniforms coaches mascots stadiums playbook pride stickers band fight songs etc  they not only have the main fightsong but also the side songs that each school plays in between plays
this attention to every small detail pays offthe sound on this game is decent
youll hear a lot of the same thing from madden
the commentating is a bit better and less redundant but after a few games youll hear the same things
the best thing about this game is replayability
there is the great dynasty mode and the ability to link with madden  so you can import your graduating class to the madden draft
this is getting  your moneys worth
if you wanted to you could keep madden  and this game and never buy another game againoverall this is an excellent purchase
only reason i dont give it  stars is because it looks too much like madden not a bad thing but it wouldve been nice to have its own lookea sports muchanticpated college football endeavor for the ps has finally arrived
for years ncaa football has offered many college football fansvideo gamers a bridge towards the eagerlyanticipated start of the actual seasonsimply put ncaa  does not disappontthe graphics are very good
i dont want to say excellent as in some ways i find the graphics on madden  a little bit better
the details are sharper you can see more wrinles in the jerseys but the actual proportions of arm muscles head size and muscle tone is somewhat inconsistent
the fact that were even discussing muscle tone and shirt wrinkles is amazing in and of itself
animations seem to be plentiful
unlike madden  where every reception by a player was a pirouette the animations for receptions alone are numerousgameplay is superb
controls are very realisitic and the action is very realistic
the addition of the  man announcing team of brad nessler lee corso and kirk herbstreit leave much to be desired
corso is as annoying as madden is saying the same things time and time again over and over
not much to offer either
the play by play and color commentary sometimes dont truly match the action on the field and can get repetitive very quickly
this needs to be improvedthe best feature of this game however is the dynasty mode
college football enthusiasts will love the fact that you can build your own team up from the ashes by recruiting freshmen redshirtng players and cutting players who dont perform
the depth of this feature is mindboggling and anyone who played previos versions of ncaa will not be disappointedtheyve left out the great games feature which allowed you to relive some of the great games in college history and added the campus challenge which is similar to the madden cards
in campus challenge you earn points for accomplishing certain milestones ie
getting a safety rushing a  yard td holding the cpu opponent to certain number of points
earning these points allow you to unlock hidden codes like new stadiums great teams from the past and various cheatsall in all this is a musthave for the football freaki have been a fan of ea sports college football series for many years and this is without a doubt the best installment yet
from graphics to sound to the game engine this is great
the game has the usual practice season franchise mode etc i usually dont mess with any mode except franchise and this mode is great
you can take any team through numerous seasons in your attempt to build or maintain a dynasty
the game keeps track of stats for every player and even for you the coach
your rating will increase over the years as your team does sothe game play is equal to madden  havent played the new one yet and this is a good thing
you can change the routes of your recievers at the line of scrimmage which is very cool
you can still change your pass coverage as well
i do wish theyd kept the momentum meter but oh wellspeaking of stats you can see both the media top  and the coachs top  poll as well as the bcs rankings
you have a heisman race and you will be able to see the all america teams
finally you even have players of the week
if this isnt enough some weeks you might get lucky and have tv coverage in which espns team including lee corso will call the gamethis game is the ultimate college football game
id give it  stars but its not quite perfect so itll get i bought this instead of madden because i like college football much more then professional
the quality is equal to madden  so its just your choice if like nfl or ncaa morethe reason i dont give it  stars is that they dont load the players names
they have the numbers correct but i am a wolverine fan so the back of walkers jersey just says 
if you want the names you have to enter them yourself
thats annoying
and the michigan football stadium is not even close to the real thing they show polls and an upper level at one angel
i had ncaa  for ps one and they did a much better job of catching the look and feel of the teams home fields
but the tech
quality of this is awesomethis is broken into two parts
final fantasy  is first then chrono trigger
note that the combined score is  stars
final fantasy  the prodigal son returns some would say
this time it is the athentic japanese version too
to those who dont know the super nintendo release was shall we say dumbed down for the americans since when are americans dumb
we are  and  after all review history if you dont understand
not anymore
the script is the original
no more you spoony bard which was much more colorful in the japanese version
new spells abilites and even monsters have arrisen and have kicked the games difficulty up several notches
as if the game wasnt hard enough to begin with
the music is still the same old bit music but it still is moving
the story is very deep and contains death betrayal and love
this was back when square focused more on story than on graphics and cinematics
speaking of which the cinematics are beautiful
they do show signs of being not as well done as some other cg movies that square has produced
this game received  stars
chrono trigger the prequel of chrono cross with many sad problems
the main one is the hideously evil load times
these mainly occur during the battle and nonbattle mode changes
the lag time is about three seconds in many places
this slows down the game in such a way that those who played the original cartidge will quickly become antsy because things are taking longer then they are used to
the slow down also makes it hard to build levels without going mad
the slowdown also affects the anime movies
the beginning sequence is jumpy and seems to progress very oddly
the movies would have been beautifully well done if only they didnt have these problems
the music is very well done as well
who could forget maguss dark theme or frogs heroic overture
they have returned in all their super nintendo glory and have been well preserved
as an added feature you can access any of the movies songs and other specials after you have come across them or have completed one of the  endings in the game
the story is very complex and it is hard to keep up with especially with several time periods and many things happening at once
this usually occurs after you get tothe end of time
insert onimous music here
a very deep skill and tech system is the games crowning feature and gives you the reason to fight the maddeningly slowed down battles
all in all the game received  stars
it is fairly obvious that the gem in this rerelease is final fantasy  my recommendation would be to play this firsti dont get why these remakes arent perfectfinal fantasy iv suffers some major slowdown when you use menus in combatand the load times before battles and switching to the sub screen in chrono trigger are absurdthat saidthese are still very playable versions of two of the most important games in rpg historyand taken as such are worth buyingall the old timers will get to relive their super nes glory days while all the kids who cut their teeth on final fantasy vii might actually learn something about the genres rootsaside from some nice new fmv and a decidedly better translation on ffivthoughdont expect a lot of improvementsif you like early rpgs this ones for you
if you have played chrono cross this one show where it all startedchrono trigger a group of time traveling heroes take part in convoluted quests to save the day
because theyre heroesthis game kept me busy with its quests and plots
the characters had character and while i didnt care for some marle magus those i did care for frog robo warmed my heart when they were affected by the storytheres a lot of backandforth in this game not as much as the horrendous final fantasy ii but sometimes i felt that there was some filler that wasnt needed
despite all the tedious main and sidequests the story kept things entertaining
the graphics though dated were lively and cartoonish
the music was forgettable save for a few tunes
while this might be a bad thing its not because the music gelled with the visuals to make for a seamless thrillonce one beats the game they can start over with all the items and skills they picked up in their previous game
this makes the hunt for the alternate endings easier and adds to the replayability of the gamewhile more helpful that recent rpgs ive played this game still requires a walkthrough to accomplish certain tasks especially the sidequests
i have fun following walkthroughs but for once i want a straightforward game without any convolutionsfinal fantasy iv like the first final fantasy game this was fun
the characters had character and the plot twists and turns kept coming
the gameplay was exciting and allowed for no timewasting which heightened the tension and dramawhile an engaging experience this game starts to lag and lose focus near the end at the final plot twist of sorts
the quest for the crystals turns into something else that isnt as interesting as the initial purposealso kain has as many heel turns as lex luger
reallyas with the first final fantasy and even the second playing without a walkthrough is almost impossible especially when it comes to defeating certain enemies
this is really the only terrible thing about his game and its not that big of an issue
my wife and i enjoyed playing with the walkthrough and actually preferred it that wayoverall an awesome duo of rpg classicsi got it because i wanted to help complete my colletion of final fantasy games and keep it on as few platforms as possible
crono trigger was just a bonus for me
the port could have been better but i got what i wantedi played chrono trigger when i was a kid loved it very much another one of my favorites
great gameok heers the deal this game is really great it has truly stood the test of time
finla fanatsy  was a great game with a very invovling story and chrono trigger my favorite of the two was just awsome
the music was truly awsome and the fight scenes never really got annoying the cinematics were very well done in both games
though graphics were slightly better in chrono trigger they werent much to brag about but that did not hurt the game much
but ffs graphics couldve killed the game without gameplay sure they were great back in the day but now they show their age
nonetheless i advise either getting this game or at least trying it even if you dont like rpgs at least try it
the two great games on this collection are truly wonderful and are a must rentbuy collection
but if you are only interested in flashy graphics and couldnt care less about gameplay music or story well you really outta re think your rating systemeven though that most people will overlook this game because its a playstation game thats a rerelease of a bit game during a time when weve already moved on to the bit generation if youre an rpg fan that has yet to play either of these classics its a musthave title
with the multiple endings and fantastical game design and lovable characters chrono trigger alone is worth the full price of admission
add in final fantasy iv and you have an astonishing deal that you simply shouldnt pass up
jody bissoonquotfinal fantasy ivquotthe first bit final fantasy game its considered by many to be the best
personally i preferred ffvi but different strokes the graphics havent aged particularly well in the nearly ten years since its original release but the music still is quite welldonethose who have played the original us release final fantasy ii will discover that the new version has a completely revamped translation and a rampedup difficulty level  a definite mark in the plus column for the game
and as a bonus it is marked by the nearabsence of load timesquotchrono triggerquotone of the best games of the bit gaming era its an enjoyable romp through time with engaging characters and dialogue and an intriguing storyline
its also the predecessor to the playstation game chrono cross and a mustplay to pick up all the nuances of that gamethe game has aged as well as could be expected  the music and graphics sound crude in this era of polygons fmv fullmotionvideo and synth game music that sounds like the real thing but the quality is still evident
the story is as absorbing as ever and the addition of the extras mode  with added anime fmvs to link the game to chrono cross  makes it even betterthe only real problem with chrono trigger is the terrible slowdown that plagues the game
if you can put up with the severalsecond load times for battles and menus the game is as good as it ever was  and thats pretty darn goodif youve never played the original games this is your chance
and if you have take the opportunity to savor the nostalgia
and with two games for the price of one this is definitely a collection worth buyingchrono trigger and final fantasy iv is something that a newgen gamers whose first rpg is ff vii or other cookiecutter ff gamespunk like me have been dying to own in the first place
of course im expecting ct ten times more than ff iv but who cares
you have final fantasy iv previously only released in japanese version and chrono trigger the best rpg ever on par with ff vi it is still debatable which title is betterfor all you other newgen rpgers or gamers whos wondering whats all the fuss with these quotoldfashioned gamesquotheres a quick glance of these two titleschrono trigger the prequel to the best selling chrono cross
tells of a kid named cronowhat
and his companions travel through different time periods
the game starts off with crono visits the millennial fair to see his friendluccaand witness her new invention
after trying out luccas devicea girl who tagged along with him decides to try it outtoo
and a bizarre thing happened when that girl vanished and was nowhere to be found
the cool thing about this game is no random battleslike chrono crossa cool fighting system called the quottechquot systme which allows up to three characters to perform a move simultaneouslyall three moves executed at onequotthis quottechquot system can be used to sort out different sorts of combination moves and hencereputed to be one of the best battle systems ever created
the graphics are the best thing ever happened to the snes consoleas the background graphics has almost infinite variety of colourrefined spritesand smooth animation
ct also has the best music by nobou uematsu since ff vii and ff vi
too badthere is no orchestrated bonus tracks because itll rocklike the ct themefinal fantasy ivthe story is about cecil and his companions stopping an evil king from collecting  crystals
after reluctantly slaughtered innocent lives to get one of the crystals for the kinghe questions the kings authorityand was dismissed from his battalion
in additionhe is forced to deliver a package to a townwhich thenyou figure it out
there is nothing revolutionary herethe same ol random battlesturn based stuff
what could really pull casual gamers off is the graphicswhich is much more eyesore than ff vilunar or phantasy star
heckit even make ct looked like ff vii
the backgrounds are plainthe animation of sprite characters are pretty basicbut minusthe superb d monster designsthankfully the translations are pretty goodunlike ff vthusmaking the game more bearable to playhowevergames are not meant to be appreciated by graphics alone
ct has a great soundtrackintriguing storyline while ff iv has cool dungeon designs original storyline and superb translation
butwhy  starsyou ask
i might even tone it down to three stars or worse had it been not the redeeming qualities i mentioned just now
sad to saythe slowdown is much worse than ff vi for ct and notsosmooth controls
whysquarethe loading times between dungeons are sooooooo long
and its a  bit for cryin out loud
and would someone explain why ff iv takes two slots from a memory cardin conclusion try out the games before you buy itbut if you do not have ctthats a good jolly reason for buying ffc
its ol school stuffbut it will appeal even casual gamers if appreciated right
have a nice daythis is a great buy for fans of both the final fantasy series and the chrono games
it contains two games in one release
although the graphics for these games have been improved upon a little bit do not expect modern graphics by any meansfinal fantasy iv this was first released in the us as final fantasy ii for the snes
final fantasy iv boasted great graphics for its time and a good involving story
i would recommend this game to anyone looking for nostalgia or a good traditional rpgchrono trigger chrono trigger was first released for the snes in   chrono trigger boasts a great story with likeable characters and multiple endings
because there are several playable characters and multiple endings in this game there is a high replay value
i would recommend this game to anyone into timetravel stories fantasy scifi and rpgsfirst off final fantasy iv is a game with a lot of potential if it had been made three or four years later it couldve been a great game
but this game overestimates the  bit snes in significant ways
mostly the bag of characters that all get thrown out almost  as soon as you name them
its a pretty atrocious story and the gameplay gets a little rigid at timeshas historic value for the final fantasy series but i only recommend it for hard core fanschrono trigger on the other hand is one of those games its near impossible to find a single flaw with its so perfect
i have many personal feelings for this game too
just see for yourself its an unforgettable experiencei love it when companies rerelease classic games on newer systems for those of us who grew up with them and like to walk down memory lane and ff chronicles collects  great games in one
i have many blissful memories of playing ff   at the time when i was much younger and it was newly released
my obsession with final fantasy started with number  and was established without doubt after playing  it is a phenomenal albeit very dated game
the characters and storyline are among the best in ff history and the gameplay though straightforward remains very fun
the graphics and sound of the game were top notch when released
the graphics remain very colorful and appealing even now and the music is good if rather cheap sounding compared to modern games
i sometimes wish they would have spiffed these games up a bit improving the instrumentation of the music adding some bonus features etc
 but i can also respect getting the games in their original form without alteration except for the cg scenes of coursethat is one area of major disappointment for me the cg movies they added to ff  they exhibit the worst graphics i have ever seen on the ps
a big disappointment especially coming from the masters at square
it looks like someone with no experience just threw them together at the last minute
i would rather they just not added them
furthermore i wish they could have maybe spliced them into the game instead of just having them at the beginning and end
that really misled mestill a great faithful remake of a wonderful game from the days of oldi never played chrono trigger on the snes so it was a new experience for me and i did wish once playing it that i had played it in my youth as it is a phenomenal game that although i enjoyed it i would have appreciated much more when i was younger
great graphics for the time and about the best music ive ever heard in a video game
the story and game play really pull you in and the world is one like any great fictional place where you find yourself wishing you could just become part of italso in contrast to ff  i really enjoyed the cg movies they added
they are in the anime style by the guy who did dragonball z are spliced into the game at the appropriate parts  and are really very goodi am disappointed however as many others on here have stated that this game has painfully long load times that really decreased my enjoyment of the game
every time you get into a battle or bring up the status screen there is about a  second wait which may not seem like a big deal but believe me it gets annoying real fast
still if youre patient it is a good gamei find myself wishing that they had released ff  on this compilation instead of chrono trigger though
i mean it is ff chronicles
if they had put  on here we could have had the entire ff series on the ps
as it is  will likely never be available in a form im willing to acquire and play and thus it will eternally remain a hole in my ff experience
if they had put ff  on here maybe they could have done another  disc compilation with chrono trigger and secret of mana
now that would have been awesomesadly i can only give this  stars overall and thats me being realistic as opposed to overly nostalgic
they are both great classic games and im glad to have them and i did enjoy them
but this collection is flawed in several ways that just a little bit more work from square could have prevented and made this truly worthy of  starsi had never played either ff iv or chrono trigger before this so this review isnt a nostalgia thing
chrono trigger is highly regarded as a classic snes rpg and one of the best games ever by some
ff iv is a final fantasy game
i was pleased and a little bit tired of chrono trigger once id finished and i never wanted to see ff iv ever againi played ff iv first and it wasnt cool
id expected more from it
it did start out okay and it does have cool characters like cecil the morally conflicted dark knight and kain and cid the crazy airship builder and edge the ninja prince
but it just fell to pieces
the first major problem is when cecil is turned from a decent character into a sissy paladin a couple hours in
that was just lame
this meant that instead of having an interesting role to play the conflict between morals and following orders you are just saving the world
that is what you do in most games but in ff iv it isnt a well developed theme
the story is okay but not innovative though there is some cool stuff like the underground dwarves
the ending was just stupidthe main problem though is the combat system
it has the standard final fantasy action system which is decent but it doesnt have action bars which it seems to need to keep itself honest
this results in enemies attacking four times between each of your guys moves
there is also plenty of spell junk the worst offender being the enemies which give all of your guys every negative status affect at the same time
this is especially annoying because ff iv has at least ten different status affects
the boss fights are all based on finding the trick rather than having to perform well which is a bad thing
fighting becomes boring quickly and you do a lot of it because the random encounter rates are high though some more recent games still top it in that respectthe music is actually good for its age though it gets annoying after awhile
ff iv is also too old to discredit the graphics
just to mention the translation was bad like most old japanese games
and to air some minor griefs each ff iv save takes up  blocks and the save times are crazy long
it took about  hours to finish
also i had to level up for  hours before the final boss which is a fourth of the game which was the most infuriating thing ever
ff iv could have stood for  or  stars when it came out but no more than  now
some games can stand the test of time well
ff iv could notchrono trigger on the other hand is a great game that would have been the best game ever if id played it when it came out
it is definitely an rpg classic
it has awesome characters like frog and robo although their default names could use a little work crono marle luccaickthe storyline is the best part and is one of the best i can recall
it features some excellent dialogue and flashbacks and ingame cutscenes
the anime cutscenes they added in were nifty and they left the old ones in too which was an excellent touch
the time travel aspect of the game was also a lot of fun
the graphics are nice enough and actually good for the snes
the style is rather unique
the music a few songs in specific like the frog theme is good and even stirring at timesthe combat is all right though it eventually begins to stagnate so i could only take chrono trigger in small doses
it uses a standard action system with the main difference from other rpgs being that each character has a list of moves they learn in order instead of having all the spells available
i cant decide if this is better or worse
the boss fights are unique though several fall victim to being trick fights as well
chrono trigger is awesome in that it doesnt have random encounters
that was a wonderful change and a definite plusthe main problem is with the emulation on the playstation which gave chrono trigger horrific load times for some reason
this was a terrible error which did detract from the game
they are really bad as bad as most new games
chrono trigger took about  hours to beat and would be a  star game when it came out but the load times are bad enough to bring it down to  stars combined with age
while age hurt it less than ff iv chrono trigger has still been weathered downin conclusion buy final fantasy chronicles for chrono trigger and dont even get ff iv out unless you are a huge final fantasy fan
in the case of video games a compilation is worth as much as its best part
there are several newer better rpgs you could play first but the more chrono trigger ages the worse it will seem so pick it up as soon as possible if you havent played it already
it is goodany rpg fan who owned a super nintendo in the early s will no doubt recongnize the two games included in this package
chrono trigger and final fantasy  formerly known as ff in the us were two of the best role playing games released for any console system at the time
chrono trigger is an rpg which combines elements of the final fantasy series with the character designs of akira toriyama best known for his work on the dragon ball animated series
final fantasy  was the very first final fantasy game to be released for the super nintendo and introduced many features for the first time that would later become a staple of the series
both games are strictly d and while they look very outdated by todays standards their storyline and depth are still superior to many of the newer rpgs
the only downfall with final fantasy chronicles is the loading time especially in chrono trigger
these games were originally designed to be displayed on the super nintendo and the playstation has a hard time keeping up with all of the sprite based graphics
it also would have been nice if ff chronicles included a soundtrack cd like the one in final fantasy anthology
in any case if you are a rpg fan you cant afford to pass up this great dealffiv final fantasy ii in usa and chrono trigger are some of the best that squaresoft has to offer
i do believe that both are equally good games and do have moving storylines
ffiv have been much more harder than the original that was been released on super nintendo
in my opinion the only loading times is when you load the game and saving as well
now there is an extra memo save feature included for players convienience
it saves just as fast as the snes by using the playstation hardware as a temporary save if players wish to continue playing
then on the final save is on the memory card which does take time and assumed that the player will shut the game off
so loading was not such a big deal in ffiv since there are absolutely no loading during gameplay
just saving onto the memory card to save and turn off the game
my main gripe about the game is that there are no cg during certain points of gameplay
just at the beginning and the end thats allchrono trigger has been remastered very well in the playstation
the cgs are great and the only downfall about this title is the loading times when going to menus
it seems that chrono trigger has been the focus on remastering the title rather than ffivffiv only has a couple of movies but overall great revisted title
got harder fixed tranlation on the text more extra skills for the characters to use than the one on the sneschrono trigger has more movies than ffiv and seem to be more well looked at by the company than ffiv in my opinionif anyone is complaining about the save waiting and loading times use the memo save
then when you are ready to turn off the game then thats the time to save onto the memory card and go through that one moment of waiting timefinal fantasy iv and chronocross were great games back in the day
this import from the snes to the playstation is just as it was fifteen years ago
the game is still fun and intriguingexcellent games and i dont think much has to be said about them
if youre reading this you are likely familiar with the snes or other iterations
this version does have load times though and my copy came with a crack in the jewel casethis game shines on chrono trigger not so much final fantasy ivchrono trigger is agreed by many classic gamers to be the greatest rpg of all time to stand the test of time
these are the same group that consider earthbound super mario rpg secret of mana and other similar games to be of equal qualitychrono trigger is a game of time travel where the story unravels very well as you play learning more of lavos the creature from space that crashed into earth in the prehistoric time then lay dormant until the day of lavos in the year  at this point it became clear who the enemy was
your party learns of the end of the world in the year  seeing an old recording of this terrible day
lavos nearly wiped out all life on earth
as you play you become connected with all the characters like you are really part of the party not just controlling them
a game this epic is best played on the super nintendo not the playstation where you have to sit through painful load timesas for final fantasy iv i suggest playing this on the super nintendo as well but the game would be in japanese
i have never been a fan of final fantasy i just happen to own final fantasy  japanese versions with zero intention of getting  or anything above
these were the glory days of final fantasy where it was a simple rpg with a simple plot easy to follow storythe only reason why this game gets a  out of  is because the playstation is a terrible game system to play any rpg because anytime you do anything you have to wait at least  seconds for the pause menu or even  seconds for a battle to load
these games are also available on nintendo ds but chrono trigger was changed in some points and the additional sidequests seemed like chores than actual entertainment minus the final battle versus the dream devoureranother excellent gba title this games quotquest modequot is while simple very entertaining and engaging
the multiplayer mode which is the mainstay of any bomberman game is a lot of fun especially with other people although the computer opponents are quite entertaining as wellaltogether very high replayability and good for a quotquick gamequot
one of the better gba titles out there right now i recommend this as one of the initial titles purchased for your gba only really surpassed by advance wars
regardless its a very welcome addition to any game library and doesnt sit on a shelf or in a bag for very longi go tell you what made me buy a type of bombermanblast your way thruogth levels by destroying your opponents with strategically place bombs that rigth there made me buy bomberman online for dreamcastthis not as good as that vison but is still great and funill get down to it pso is addicting and quite the experience
in my case i am playing dreamcast pso for the first time already being exposed to bb and ngc
compared to those two this one is the lesser but if youre experiencing pso for the first time here get ready for a great adventurephantasy star online pso is a good game bordering on great
the game starts off with a ship called pioneer  heading to a planet to migrate there because earth was no longer livable
pioneer  had said that everything was aok so pioneer  was sent off with the rest of earths population to go to ragol the name of this particular planetbut when p gets there they loose all contact with p
this is where you come inyour character is tasked with investing the many areas of ragol in search for survivors and any clue to as why the animals have suddenly gone aggressive
this is about the most story your going to get in one chunk with pso the rest of it is told via side quests and little text orbs in the main gamepso was meant to be an online game and it shows pioneer  is pretty empty and the npcs never say anything different unless your on a side quest
normally when your online this is the place where other players are supposed to benow since there is no conventional way of getting online yes you can still go onto pso onlinevia private servers all the areas will feel empty and you can blatantly tell that you were not supposed to be the only one doing some of the missionsthe graphics of pso are very nice for a dreamcast gameimagine a stepped down version of psu and your not to far from the mark
gameplay is pretty funif your a beginner on pso then you might want to try your character out as a ranger firstbeing a hunter or force you first time will result in you not playing pso very long
my only complaint is that you have to do an area over an over again to get the proper level to beat the bosslater floorsbecause as mentioned aboveyou were supposed to be in a group to beat the bosses at lower levelsprosgood amount of character customizationgood graphicsgameplay is fairly funfeeding you mag is rewardingcan still go onlineconswas meant to be onlinethus levels seem kind of emptyhave to go through levels multiple times to be strong enough to beat bossesgame just feels overall empty offlineoverall id recommend this game if you like phantasy star gamesbut if you want a great offline experience with a story go for psuklonoa and friends are really quite cute and have a very fun postsanrio design to them
the gameplay is geared towards a kinder gentler younger audience i believe
kids over the age of  might find it a bit soft thoughits an enjoyable game much in the same flavor as sonic and the rest but a bit more lighthearted
at least in the handful of levels i completedits very cute
but i dont really have any desire to play it throughthat was my first thought when i saw this cuddly little guy in the video store
i rented it and when it was due back i was into it so i bought it
some parts can confuse you while youre staring right at the obvious you get to surf on a log and did i mention the cuteness
of course you get to collect things and you dont get past every area or boss without a little thought admiration at the scenery going back for something and a fatality or two trying to reach those nasty collectables
when the game is over your quest continues in collecting
i wish the klonoa  before this wasnt so rare and i would really like a third one with some more platform roamabilitydefinitly get this
you can replay the levels over again without starting overan incredibly fun game
so easy to pick up and play through whenever you wantthe game is very intuitive which adds to the lack of difficulty
could use harder puzzles to offset the simple controls
also the game is very short
can be beat in as little as an hour maybe lessthere are a few items to collect throughout the levels but they are easy to grab and do not add much to the gamein short fun gamethis game is so pretty
the settings and game play are super creative
its a dream game for youngsters
klonoa does speak in japanese however as it is a japanese game  they do translate it
if youre nosy and like to know what people are saying at all times this might annoy youno im quite serious
why the heck did i buy this thing
the collection of titles as of this writing is really slim pickings
especially for someone whos been playing games since atari was at their height of power
so i saw the previews and figured quotwhat the heckquot ill preorder the thing from amazonso the big day arrives and i get a small package from amazon
tear open the package and popped in the dvd
hhhmm cute graphics and smooth animation
well i wasnt two minutes into the game when i hear a squeal from behind me
its my girlfriend who wants to play the game
so i figured quothey why notquot and handed over the controls
well that was a big mistake
i havent been able to play my ps sinceso looking over her shoulders the game is a sort of dish side scroller
navigation is limited to left or right motion there are spots where this deviates from that but its a moot point reminiscent of some of the later mario or sonic games
the games graphics are incredibly clean and are a clue to the future power of the ps and its ilkin short this game is perfect to keep the little brat or girlfriend off of your back for a while
however i do have some gripes about the game
the game gives the illusion that it supports two player control however this is not true
the quotsecondquot player is nothing more than a helper for the first when the first player is in trouble
useful for very young players but extremely boring for any one else
what i dont understand is if the developers felt that this was a necessity why is this option only available on the second controller
it should have either been all or nothing
full control of the second character for the second player or the ability to map the control of the second character to the first controller
not this half planned junk that namco attempted
the story is also pretty decent but never really answers the question quotwhat the heck is klonoaquot i suppose this question is actually answered in the original
too bad namco didnt notice that the original game is going for insane amounts of money
they couldve made a quick buck by rereleasing the gameoh well life bites
but hey thats what i get for buying this game
i suppose i should be able to play my ps as soon as my girlfriend quits playing klonoa  that is of course if she doesnt discover my copy of dark cloudklonoa is an excellent gamethe visuals are no polygon pusher but the textures colors and character models give the game a disticnt happy golucky feel that no one can call bad
the games atmosphere is what truly sets me off on ranting about how much i love the gamethe game isnt very challenging but it remains to be endless fun
with several secret levels and many things to collect the game doesnt get old
the control is the most simple control that has ever crossed a console which is why it is so excellent
any person from ages  will have a good time playing this game
it is slightly challenging of the mind but it isnt challenging for the people that are somewhat lacking in platformer skillsthere simply isnt anything bad about this game besides the fact that its  hours tops
but after unlocking everything and gettin the secrets in a new game its about the n called it a rumble pack although it says memory card so im not mad in fact rumble packs are cool but i still wouldve liked it to work as what it said i was gettingworks great but is  not authentic nintendo
but as i said it definitely does the job just fine as it shouldi bought this one to avoid paying much more for a label and it worked just as well as the oem version
i never had any problems with it for the few years i had itwas so amazed you could still find these things
finding ones with good batteries is even more impressivebut it worked well my savegames stayed exactly on the card where they belonged ceased running around the neighborhood kicking elderly people in the shinswonderful ps savegame wranglerthis is a nice memory card but it does not hold that much
yes it is old and made for the psone but most people had allot of games so u cant put allot on this one
it is made by sony so it is the best brand to buy but it should have been much bigger
if i were u i would either buy two of them or get a bigger onei plug one end into the wall and the other into the playstation and suddenly a little red light comes on on the playstationwhen i got this cable in the mail i was super excited
i expected to be blown away by sleek visuals and popping colors similar to the way i was when i hooked my wii up to my hd tv using a component cable
i was let down
the colors were dull
the motion was blurry
it just did not look good
but after an hour of tweaking the visual settings i finally found a balance that makes things look really good
it is definitely a step up from using a standard definition tv with composite cables
a welcome step up
this is the best way to play ps games on a pswhat i did was set the tv settings to  as opposed to wide screen or full screen adjust the tv settings
boost color sharpness contrast
adjust brightness adjust in game visual settingsthis component cable is a must own for ps owners that want to play their ps on a hd tvfinal fantasy xii looks glorious
the best ive ever seen itif you have questions about the longevity and durability of this cable comment on this review and i will respond
i have only owned it for a day as of this review starsto get the the ps to display on your tv you have to adjust the ps settings before you plug in your component cable turn on your ps with your composite cables plugged in go to system settings change the video out to component video out
choose ycbrb crpr as opposed to rgb
if you dont do this you will get a blank screen and your component cables will not work turn off the ps and hook up the component cable turn on your ps
select the right input on your tv and enjoyi have an hdtv and it only has  rca port  hdmi ports  component port and  rgb port
i got tired of having to unhook my n or ps from the back of the tv every time i wanted to play one system so i ordered this cable to solve the problem  i ordered the gta trilogy and i wanted to replay the classics in better resolution
the cable is absolutely amazing
it arrived one day earlier than stated
upon opening the package i could feel that the cable was made of high quality product  it didnt feel cheap or lightweight
the jacks that plug into the tv were a little a small but with a little wiggling and force i got them to fit
and once it gets inside your tv it will fit snug and you wont have to worry about it slipping out
the end that plugs into your ps fits a little snug too
it may take a little bit of pressure to push it in
before you connect the component cables with the rca cables still plugged into your ps under the browser select system configuration and change your display output from rgb to y pbcb prcr
if you dont change it beforehand you will be stuck looking at a blank screen
once you change it to y pbcb prcr feel free to connect your component cables
after hooking my component cables up i noticed a huge difference from the standard rca cables
the sound was much clearer and a little louder
the games looked brighter clear and more vivid
this product is great
i highly recommend it
its no hdmi but it will definitely bring new life to your ps gamesyou must st set your playstation s settings to video output ypbpr
using the cord on a vga monitor and the video difference is like night and day
this is so much better over rca
not  sure how the comparison fares over a real hdtv thoughbut its a given with the ps when playing on a hdtv
but there are exceptions the top game you expect to have good visuals do look good in hd somewhat
not sure if its worth it but its up to you if you want  to play your ps games with slight boost in color clarity
but most if not some of the graphical flaws will stick out especially older gamesthis thing just comes in a plastic bag  the sticker on said bag has a barcode and reads simply component av cable for playstation   new
theres no company logo on the actual plug either just the arrow on the top that shows you which side should be facing the top when you plug it into the ps
while amazon mentions the distributor i have no idea who actually manufactures this thing
it says nothing of substance which is unfortunate because this is not plugandplay so to speakhere are the supersimple instructions it should have
you must first boot up your ps with the normal av cables without a disc in or with the disc tray open and go to system configuration than change your component video out settings from rgb to y cbpb crpr
now turn it off plug in the component cable turn it back on and go to the component video mode on your hdtv  the ps picture will be coming in clear as a bell thats a saying right
why couldnt this have said that  just the slightest piece of paper with this crucial information
whoever made this is a lazy suspicious manufacturerbut it works
it works so well
so i dont know why theyre acting like they have some shoddy product worth hiding
ps games no longer look blurry or fuzzy on my hdtv no ghosting or any other image issue that they previously had
they look as sharp as or sharper than anything else from that generation  the dreamcastgamecubewiixbox
if youve downloaded ps games from the playstation classics portion of the psn on your ps than its a very similar quality of visuals
its a marked improvement over how things look traditionally
so i highly recommend the cable  this thing gets the job done for sure and its super cheapthe ps library is legendary  this is serious contender for best console of all time along with the psx and snes so if you want to enjoy your games on modern tvs you have to pick this up
not to mention picking up older games from the massive library is a great solution if youre looking to game on the cheap or miss genres that are badly supported on newer consoles like jrpgs
this is a gamechanger it pulls the ps kickingandscreaming back into the living room along with any other console plugged into your hdtv all the way up the psbut it needs instructions  you gotta know what youre doing first
and you also better make sure you pay attention to the plug it doesnt seem to quite want to fit in the ps at first and needs some gentle shoving make sure the side with the arrow is pointed up like the rgb cable already in your ps
it seems suspicious but its not and it works really well
cant star it though since its so weirdly presented like a shoddy productbut it is definatly a hit
when i first got this game i thought that the controls were sucky
but now that i have played it for a while i got used to it its hard to switch from the game for n and this one
the levels are totally awesome and the scenery is great
the tracks could have been a little more intresting though
i discovered that peach the racer has the best speed and handling
she is really good at sharp turns unlike toad or yoshi
the  and cc are quite easy but prepare for some real racing at cc
the graphics are perfect in this game couldnt have been better
there are some extra tracks you can get in this game i already have some but they are really hard
great game with awesome play
could have been a little cheapermario kart is still hands down one of the best racing games ever made and this game boy advance version doesnt say otherwise
the graphics are still nicely detailed for a handheld game to the point of where it looks like a console game
the racing tracks are still awesome as they were in past iterations the weapons are still excellent the classic characters are still a lot of fun to play and basically everything is still good
unfortunately it doesnt feel as good as my snes and n mario kart games its still a lot of fun but it just isnt as good
still its one of the best handheld racers ever made and theres no reason you shouldnt like it unless you dislike fun in generalto begin with let me say i have not played konami racers  the other cart racer available for the advance
from what i hear that is also an excellent title and you should probably check that out if you are interested in this one
i chose to get this one since i am more familiar with the nintendo cast of characters
you get to choose from mario luigi princess peach toad yoshi donkey kong wario or bowser on a total of  tracks
in addition to  modes quick race time trial  where you try to beat your old best score on a single track and gp  the race you have the option of playing against others using the link cable
if you have only  cartrige your choice of track and character is limited to  so if this is the main thing you want to do you may want to pick up  or look at konamis title
the game is adjustable in difficulty with  quotccquot levels the higher the more difficult and fast
the gameplay is awesome and it feels just like the old super nintendo title if you ever played that
the graphics are very sharp like most advance games but one thing that makes mario cart stand out graphically is the bright colors
as a result of the colors it is not always necessary to use a light source
that is a huge bonus
the only reason i am not giving this game  stars is since it lacks originality face it we have seen this type of game on the gameboy already and this particular cart is a straight conversion of the old super nintendo game
with that said this game makes an excellent purchase and will be fun for all ages esp if you have someone to play against
so fire it upso you like mario
you like the mario kart games
you wish you could play mario kart while on the road
here is your wish mario kart advance
what a great game this one is with new levels sharp graphics and sound the same characters and massive fun
though it is more similar to the snes version of mario kart you can not complain about this game in any way
it is hard or easy depending on the speed you play it at and this game is just a rushthere is one flaw with this game though that stood out to me
whoever the first  players to win the first round of the series of races are the same  players that will be in the top  the rest of the series unless you play on  cc  or possibly  cc
that aside this is a great game nonethelesswhen i first got my gba i got tony hawk  fzero and chu chu rocket
and had some fun
but i got sick of fzero and it was the only game i had that didnt need perfect lighting since its a racer
i got sick of the gba until this came out
i just got it and i know that some of the other games i have will be collecting dust before you know iti got to play the original legend that appeared on the snes years ago
i got the n version and had a blast
but from what i can remember of the original the gba version is a nicely done blend of both the original and the n remake
in fact the graphics are in between the original and remake in qualitysound is cooel
from every launched shell to every splash you make when stupidly driving into a lake the sound is superb
i cant stand playing this with the gbas builtin speaker when the headphones really bring on the stereo
pretty good music toogameplay is what a game is really all about but everyone has forgotten that since the atari became extinct
the controls are solid let alone the gbas cramped configuration of buttons
im playing this like a madman when not staring at the tv playing klonoa 
if the graphics suck which they dont so what
the game is fun
the coolest part is that you arnt crashing into walls every turn like in fzeroallinall here is one of the reasons why you need to sell your game boy color and evolve to the awesome if you prefer not to say the word quotfancyquot bit game boy advance
all i can say is if youre a kid youll get a lot of time out of this if youre at the office all day long youll be making like solid snake and sneaking into your kids room to snatch his game boy advance to play some of thisthis title stands as pure excellence
tracks are great and they are generally easy to navigate
the computer opponents always manage to stay competitive and the replay value for this title is near unlimitedgraphically it is very polished
the tracks are loaded with nice detail and it really stands out as one of the best looking games around
the control has always been a strong point is mario games and this is no exceptionwhile there are a few flaws they do not hurt the overall game too much
first off the music is annoying
it really adds to the feeling that this is clearly a kids game alienating the older audience
all the racers handle very similar to each other and you will be hardpressed to find much of a difference
certain tracks are also very easy to fall off of and the battle mode borders on lamebut these flaws do not really hurt the game
they also cannot take away the fact that mario kart super curcuit is the best racer on a handheldi wasnt into this game yet until i got the gameboy advance to go with it and other games
so this game had super mario bros  where you are dueling monsters from pipes
that was my favorite game but i didnt like the kart racing that much like i used to on nintendo  because of that nintendo  had something better that i liked
i just took this game for granted and played another gamemario luigi wario peach yoshi bowser toad and donkey kong are back for another great racing game
the game is very easy to learn big assortment of weapons bananas ghosts shells speed mushrooms lightning bolts to shrink other racers to get ahead and clobber other racers
the nicest feature to it are the courses because they did not try to recreate the same old courses in the snes and n versions of the game
they took ideas and concepts from super mario  and made courses from them such as shy guy ship
the old favorite courses are still in it though like bowsers castle and the haunted house
the backgrounds are intensely detailed but if you take too long to look at the scenery you might spin out crash or lose the race
you can compete in one of three difficulty settings in four circuits which each with five tracks there is a secret circuit too
the big age downfall is that there are tons of huge corners that drivers must learn different techniques to race around them
not everyone can master these techniquesthis is a great game
there are a whole bunch of levels and they are all completely different
the graphics are some of the best that i have seen for the system
all of the power ups and weapons make it even better
this game is even better because it has  different speed levels
the lowest speed is very easy and the highest speed is very hard
so it is good for all skill levels
there are also bonus tracks that you can unlock and they are very fun
the only flaw in the game is turning
you basically slidea nd it is very hard to control when turning
overal this is a very good game and i recommend that you buy itlots of people seem to think this is the best gameboy game
well i defenitley think that its not the best but its pretty good
the good things about the game are that it has pretty good graphics and sounds
also at first it may seem that it only has a couple track but thats not true at all
when you unlock all the tacks theres over 
some of them arent that original the first track in the game is original but then theyll make it same background track type and add a couple of extra curves still fun though and theres lots of characters that when you choose them youll feel like your going faster or turn worse
but the bad thing that makes it not that good to me is gameplay
the game play is good not bad by any means but its easy to get off track and all of the tracks are increidbly short
the longest one takes less than  minutes to do  laps
also its very easy to win races but if you crash its hard to beat second
and most of the time you always come in second or first so theres no real good gameplay
occasionaly you might have a barely win race but thats not likely
yet its easy to win but when your done with a race you get a rateing f d c b a and its impossible almost to get an a but yet its easy to win a race
i think many of these problems could have been fixed by haveing it on a bigger system because the scale is so small a little bit of a wrong turn leads to a crash and it gets pretty annoying if you want an a rateing to unlock more tracks
all in all i think its a fair game
i give it  stars because its just not bad enough for three with its redeming qualitiesfun game but the graphics r not as good as the s
it is more like the snes version for graphics anyway
i played this game all the time when it first came out
it was the only gba game i wanted to play after a while
it has a good two player mode not many gba games had two player
i thought the graphics were good at first untill i got the ds mario kart and i stoped playing it
then i thought the graphics were horrible but u got to remember its the gba and it came out in  now its  and sometimes i still play it
the  graphics were only better because nintindo went computerized with is so it had more of unblocky graphics
but this and the snes have about the same graphics
the sound is pretty good so over all i give this game a  but mostly because of the graphics compared to the ds but i got to remember that it is  years oldmario kart super circuit for gba is a great character racing game
players can choose from  different characters and race on up to  different tracks
 of the tracks on this cartage are newly created for this game and once you master those tracks the other  tracks from the original mario kart on the super nintendo become available
what makes this game shine is that it has an infinite amount of replay value because of its ranking system and levels of difficulty
depending on how many coins players pick up and what their times are on each track they get a grade for their effort
the hardest grade to receive is a three star rating
this is a really hard rating
it will take a gamer a long time to get three stars for all  tracks on all three of the different difficulty levels
while this game has a lot to offer the lack of a feeling of true speed is what kept me from giving this game a five star rating
it is an all around great game and one that should be in everyones gba library but because of the lack of true speed such as in fzero and the mechanics of the power slide that were down graded from the n version i am only able to give this game four starsthe game is very simple
you choose which mode you want to play with your options being oneplayer multiplayer and something called a ghost exchange that ive never tried but would guess is similar to the pokemon crystal version thing where you can press yours and your friends game boys together and each get a gift from each other
in oneplayer mode you can choose from the mode where you race the computer a mode where you race yourself to see how fast you can get your time and a mode that i believe is the older setup of mario kart without the coins and points
then you choose the level of diffuculty and pick your character mario luigi peach and you know the rest
afterwards you battle it out on interesting colorful tracks trying to rank high and except in the timed mode win a trophy
like i said its simple but its also very addicting and the graphics are fantasticmario kart for the game boy advance is a fun game
it is not as fun as some of the other mario kart games but if you like any of the mario kart games then you will like this one toomario kart has been a classic game on nintendo
since the snes super nintendo was made this game has been traveling from generation to generation
finally the gameboy advance version has arrived and its just perfect
you can select between  characters mario luigi peach bowser dk toad wario and yoshi and race more than  new tracks
it also includes the link it up which allows you to play up to  players with only one gamepackwhen i bought it i started playing it and it was a blast
then after a week or more i beat it
it was worth my timethen i continued playing and i got bored of the same thing
the only thing that kept me playing was battle mode
in this mode you have three ballons attached to your kart
you have to get powerups and destroy your enemies until they have no more ballons and you have to protect yours
it is great while it lasts
you can also keep playing this game with your friends that have a gameboy advance note you will need the link cable
buy it and enjoy the world of racingthis game is cool but the n version is better
better apperance better handling and more battle modes but i guess this will do while on the gothis is a pretty good game
i was really impressed with how many tracks there are
after you think you beet it you find more tracks that you can play and race on
all of the graphics for these tracks are excellent with lush and beautiful backgrounds
it is also very fun to make ghost data and try to be it again and again to get better
after i played and played for awhile it did get a little boring
overall i liked this game quite a biti reviewed this literally hours after i bought it and gave it raves
i was still in the exhaustive training mode and having a blast
several dozen missions and three sets of aa batteries later im still playing but now its about revenge
the computer player always has more bases more vehicles and more aircraft than you ever have
ive switched the game off midmission out of sheer frustration at the imbalances in this game but ultimately i have to encourage anyone who enjoys a challenge to buy this game immediately
its worth it for those times when youve finally got the computer on the run and are beating its brains out and youll love every minute of thatsome of these reveiws seem really seeded
comparing this game to red alert is a bit of a stretch
this is for the most part a copy of the console turn based classic miltary maddness and suffers the same problem
the ai is predictable
you know for the most part where and how it is going to move and attack
the ai also cheats
things like fog of war do not affect it and make those battles frustrating
the ai will tend to always have more troops than you which makes playing those maps with another player very one sided
do no get me wrong i tend to judge portable games on the amount of time it kills without being boring
advance wars is a time eater and lots of fun in the process and very long
good game for a trip or sitting aroundi thought this game wouldnt be that goodbut i was wrong
this game is great
you fight wars and you get to build tanks subs and planes and stuff
you have to think of how to win
this is the best strategy game since starcraft
you can also link up with friends and play against the computer
i also love seeing a bunch of tanks blow up a marine dont worry theres no blood
if you like turn based strategy buy thisthis game has a great multiplayer and a great oneplayer story line but this game is amazingly hard
it is easy at first but then it gets really hard i am stuck on mission  of the regular game
so if you are looking for a easy war game to beat this isnt it
but if you want a challange compleeting a game i sugest you invest in a gba if you dont have it or invest in this game because it is greatat first i was a bit irratated with the happy anime look of advance wars but after i saw past that the gameplay was absolutly excellant
the campaign mode is a little tiresome but the game really shines in its vs mode
you can play againts up to four people or computers
and unlike many modern strategy games this one actually has strategy to it
as illintelligent and biased as this review may sound play the game i enjoyed it
unfourtunatly tho it does get a little boring a little quickly but what can you doi just recently purchased the nyko ps memory card with a new colour scheme
instead of the old yellowandblack this ps card is now whiteandblue
of course it will work just as good as the standard sony ps card but i just love the new version and how it looks
hopefully  will have the new nyko ps cards in whiteandblue for sale in the near futurethis was the dreamcast game that everyone couldnt wait to come out including me
i just couldnt wait till christmas when i finally got it
the first college football game for dreamcast
the first thing that caught my eye was the amazing graphics
the grassturf on the field looks so realistic the players are a big improvement upon the nfl k graphics and the teams jerseys and helmets look much like the real ones in college
also all  college football teams are included and the announcers provide great playbyplay except for some very corny jokes and comments
the gameplay is very good most of the time anyway
soemtimes the game will slow down then the play will go  tiems as fast as it should
the game levels are whack
on walk on you can ebat teams  to  while on starter i normally win by a good  points while on all american you normally lose by  the worst thing is the bad teams are good against good teams and the legacy mode is 
i played a game earleir today florida state vs troy state
florida state won  but florida states qb throws only  for  yards  td and inetrceptions
in the legacy mode the recruiting is terrible you get a list of players and literally do a draft
also on create a player the players name wont show up during the season or in stats
despite these flaws the game is great
amazing graphics nice announcing great gameplay and a very good list of bowls to be in and the heisman trophy are all in this game
also the game is very cheap and if you like college football get this gamecollege football fans who owned a dreamcast had to wait until the last days of the systems life for a college football game and the results are mixed at best
visual concepts developers behind the nfl k series and the excellent nhl k put ncaa k together and did a fantastic job visually but all the excitement of the college ball atmosphere is missing
graphically speaking these are some of the best graphics to ever grace the dc the players move and react just like theyre real life counterparts except most players seem to have beer guts and control wise the game is flawless
the announcers however seem a little behind the play not to mention they can get rather repetitive as well
but what should have been the meat and bones of ncaa k is missing no bcs bowls except for the rose bowl only a few school specific fight songs and the legacy mode is disappointing
however if you just want to get out of the nfl arena for a while and you own a dreamcast you cant go wrong with ncaa k but if you need your video game college ball exact from the get go stick with ea sports ncaa seriesi bought a dreamcast along with this game last night
since i refuse to purchase a  xbox just to play live   i got a tip from somebody that this game is much better than live so i decided to give it a shot
they were right
this game plays and looks much better than the live series has ever looked
the player movements are more fluid the commentary is not bland eventhough they do repeat themselves and they actually seem to be watching the game
in addition to all of this the game seems more realistic
for example in live you usually can always cross over a defender and drive to the basket for an easy two
not in k or maybe its just me
it seems to me that the defense is alot better which makes for a more challenging and enjoyable experience
similary the offense is much better if you give them a wide open lane they will go in for the slam everytime
they dont stand around and do nothing as the players on live do
because of the better offense you have to play better defense much better
in live you can get away with lightly covering your man but in k you will get taken to the hoop everytie
as for you computer controlled teamates they actually go for the rebound when someone misses a shot on both offense and defense another plus over livethis game also has alot of features includingpractice mode where its just your players and the basketstreet mode in which you can play  on   on   on  or  on  in famous outdoor basketball courts around the countrytournament modefranchise modecamera modei just got the game last night so i may have left some outnow the reason i gave this game  stars instead of   having played live for  years the new controls for k is taking a little time to get used to
there is no oneonone mode
the plays seem to be on the lacking side and making play calls are a bit cumbersome
alley oops are done automatically instead of manually
i also have not figured out a way to stop my teammates from doing intentional fouls when the score is close
the anouncers repeat themselves a bit but this is real common in sports game and like i said its still much better than lives announcers
finally also being able to block nearly every shot and steal very often in the live series i am finding it real difficult to do the same in k
other than the intentional foul issue these problems are very minor and they do not affect the gameplaydont let the minor issues i listed above scare you this game is much better than live by far
the reason i got this game was because i wanted a basketball game for  and since ea decided not to release live on the pc this year i had to go elsewhere
i did not want to spend  on the xbox for this game so i got the  dollar dreamcast instead
if you already have an xbox then i would probally wait until k is released for it because it may even be better on it
but if you dont have an xbox like me then get the dreamcast and enjoy this game
ea has lost me as a customer for good and sega may have me as a new oneprosawesome gameplaygreat graphics for gbadetailed levelsconsno game slot saves just passwordsboring musicgraphics bgameplay asound bpresentationoptions aoverall nice fun gamethis game should be one of the better early game boy advance side scrollers
as spiderman fights several villans including mysterio the fishbowl headed monster
developed by vicarious visions the same group that made the tony hawk games it has pre rendered characters creating a very slick look
the colors are also used with huge contrast making the graphics greatthis game may not be a huge hit but it could contest with big side scrolling games like castlevania and jurassic park
it is definitly worth giving a trythis side scrolling adventure is a reminiscent of the konami beat em up classic that was an arcade game in the early s
as you interact with over  different x men you must destroy the forces of the ancient mutant named apocalypsein an alternate timeline where he rules the earthin this twisted alternate timeline some of your friends have changed diplomatic stance with you to enemy and vice versa
your goal is to alter the timeline to its original form
you can earn points by using special moves which you can use to improve your characters skillsoverall this game should be a great side scroller competing with jurassic park iii the dna factor and spiderman mysterios menaceback in the late s side scrolling beat em ups like double dragon and final fight were all the rage
but after manoamano brawlers like super street fighter and mortal kombat  exploded onto the scene the side scrollers fell into difavor mainly due to their stubborn refusal to change
xmenroa is a throwback to prestreet fighter chopsocky contests
and while its enjoyable in  small doses the game suffers from the same repetitve gameplay that plagued its predecessors
aside from the mortal kombat license the games bigggest strength is its graphics
all four xmen are nicely drawn and have loads of animation
storm with her bilowing cape and elemental attacks is particularly imperssive
and the backgrounds which resenble colored pencil drawings make the game look like a living comic book
the developers tossed in  unlockable characters and a headtohead fighting mode but they left out a cooperative storyline for some inexplicable reason
buy this if you are a huge fan of the xmen but most gamers will want to go somewhere else to get their kicks punches and bodyslamsthis gundam game is cool
it nicely follows the cartoon series
however the game isnt completly perfect
the controlls are kind of hard
shooting dopps or other planes is a pain
but once you unlock every ms in tactics battle it kicks butt
you can controll mss that arent in the game
you can even play as the zeons though the levels are the same for both sidesthis game has almost everything a gundam fan could want in a game
the show follows the story well it tends to be very corny but it is better than some i have seen
the music if okay it is kind of weird in the end it sounds like a japanese rapper
as for game play the controls are very well thought out
most keys are used in some form or another
the graphics and not that great but i am used to gamecube graphics so it is hard to compare the two
this game has lots of aerial ground and jumping combos with the beam sword which is the most fun if you have time to get good with it
there are several disadvantages to this game that i would like to point out
first is that the gundams take far to long to die which is not real compared to the show
second is the fact that they start you out way to quick the game gets hard to quick
also once you do get good the game is to easy so then it goes very quick particularly because it only has  levels
the good things are the exhalent game play which lets for good sword fighting
also after your beat the game you can play in tactics mode where you can win new suits and get go up in the ranks they could have made more levels to play tactics on but its not so bad
all in all this game provides an good but short gaming experiencei am a big fan of all of the gundam shows except gundam wing and i have been waiting for a long time for a good gundam game to come out and its finally here
i was a slight bit dissapointed in some categories of the game but overall i was fairly pleased
before i got the game i figured that anyone who was not familiar with the shows would be hopelessly confused after a few minutes of play considering the depth of the plot but i was proven wrong
the game is loaded with cut scenes explaing the plot and a nongundamfan friend of mine was quickly drawn in and is now obsessed with everything in the gundam universe
to make this review a little shorter ill do pros and consprosit has good graphics and is totally loyal to the series
gallery mode lets you view all of the many cut scenes listen to the game music and look at mobile suit statistics with narration and d modelslots of weaponry choicestactics battle modeopen when you complete the main part of the game lets you fight on both sides of the war and allows you to earn massive ammounts of bonus mobile suits to blow things up withpractically unlimited amunitionvery nice explosionsconssometimes frustratingly slow controls
i often feel like i have aged  years when i have succesfully completed a proper beam sword attackthough once you master them they are very rewarding and you can really kick some but also it takes a long time to turn around other than that reading the manual properly and little practice and anyone complaining of bad button mapping will reallize it was designed more for advanced playit is to short
only nine missions but the tactics battle mode will keep you happy  for a few weeks as you can get some very cool mobile suits therelack of difficulty setting
once you master the beam sword controls and the few hidden moves that come with it you will dominate the battle field
but dont worry to much about that it will take you a while to master itmix of music voices and battle mayhem make it quite hard to understand any of the three
sometimes it is best to just turn off the musicnot very good replay value
once you beat everything in the game and have all of the cut scenes and cinematics unlockedwhich took me about  months due to the fact that the tactics battle mode gets old prettey fast and i seldom played you will really only want to play it for about a week every  monthsdespite the cons which seem numerable the game is quite entertaining and will keep most people who do not dislike giant battle robots happy for a while
if you dont like it you can always sell it
laterif youve never played a re game before buy this game
youll be scared out of your mind
the graphics are hauntingly real and the gameplay is very smooth
its like being in a horror movieon the other hand if youve played previous re games this one might not seem so great
its definitely the best one of the series but its still the same kind of game run away from zombies conserve ammo find better guns and follow an expanding plot that finally leads you to a giant underground base or something
if youve gone through an re game before then you just wont be as scared by this one and being scared is what the re games are all aboutsince i havent been able to play the remakes and newer resident evil games on the gamecube i consider this my favorite
i played it on dreamcast and would have to say the ps version is the better of the two
it added more cutscenes to explain the story which i felt was good as it helped me understand what was happening
graphics arent too bad and the voices were pretty decent for the charactersthe game isnt without flaws though as i will list a few
controls can be akward to use
it took me time to get used to controls that and sometimes moving can get cumbersome
camera angles can be hard
it can be annoying when you try to move and get attacked because you cant see what lays around the corner
some puzzles and parts of the game may seem easy or difficult to some people
i found myself easily getting through somethings and having to retry on othersdespite its flaws this game is a good one
if your a fan of the series its a must have
if not then at least try it out
if you can get past the flaws then you have a good game on your handsre cvx is just as creepy as the origional
now the background moves along with the character to add a certain sense of urgency to it all
the graphics are great the control is the same as all the others and the cinemas are outstanding
the only problem with the game i have is the story
i have played and beaten the other two re games i dont count nemesis and it seems that they are hard pressed to find a new and viable story line
its all been done before
theres nothing new
sure there are a few minor variations but for the most part its the same old game with better graphics and a different backdrop
all in all it is a great game and i recommend it to any re fan
did i mention that its still really creepyre code veronica x was a very tough game i got so pissed off from minute to minute because of the many enemies that attack you from left to rightre code veronica takes place after re  claire redfield inhabits a umbrella corp lab in europe and gets captured
there she is taken to a european prison on the island somewhere
she there meets steve burnside who is another prisoner of the island
you find out his family was killed by umrella and he wants revenge
claire tells steve she is there to find her lost brother chris refield
through out the game you also meet alexander and alexia ashoford grandchildren of umbrellas founders
you also discover wesker is back and wants alexia body so he can get the virus sample from heryou can later on play as chris which is good yet it gets harder when you do as the enemies get stronger and different
you battle different bosses do puzzle and other cool stuff
but i must warn you that there are a number of things that will frustate you and make you madfrustrating things  the enemies take forever to kill and take many rounds to exterminate plus being in small numbers they are hard and will piss you the hell off
the puzzles will get to you and there are some puzzles where if you do not do them right you will die and game over this also will piss you the hell off
lastly the bosses take a while to beat being some hints of how to beat them lying around you will have to figure the best strategy for their defeat
this also will piss you off entirelyexcluding wanting to break the controller and throw your ps out the window it is a great game with a good plot cool weapons cool environments and very cool cutscenes
note the ps version has some extra cutscenes that spices up the gameafter beating it and having the good feeling of defeating the challenge you go though a deal of cool cutscenes and unlock a few good things
you can unlock a special battle game where you can choose a character from the main game and go on a small adventure with unlimited ammo through random rooms and destroy the creaturesthe game also gives you a special demo disc of devil may cry as well which is quite neat to playoverall i give it four stars for being such a indepth game and a joyous one at that
re code veronica x is a must buy for any hardcore fan of the re series hardcore gamer or anyone who likes horror shoote em up type games you wont be disappointedi bought my copy last week july  and ive been enjoying it a lot
however it is exactly in every way what i expected that is to say it is another resident evil gameresident evil  was my introduction to the series and so perhaps i am biased but that is still my favorite with a perfect balance of puzzles zombieblasting and nasty bosses
cant wait till my buddy gets the remake for his cube
code veronica seems to be a little more on the long side
but dont get me wrong im not really complaining because that adds to the whole i may die at any second and im running low on ammo and holy  what was that
kind of feel
the graphics are not bad at all for such an early release
the plot is one of the best and the voice acting is not horrible for once
you start out as claire the college girl from res and my personal favorite of the characters and then later progress to chris from res
the controls and the set camera angles are hard to get a handle on at firstunless of course you already have played some of the earlier games
if so youll be happily 
dodging zombies and blasting bandersnatches away like the pro you areif you liked the earlier resident evil games chances are youll like this one cause its basically more of the same
decent selection of weapons decent graphics and claire even cooler this time around the umbrella block
its a worthwhile way to spend fifteen or twenty bucksan important note if youve only ever played or seen a resident evil game on someones gamecube and are now wanting more of the same on your ps rent it first
the gameplay is more stilted theres less ammo and a lot of zombies and the graphics will sorely dissapoint youresident evil has been a personal favorite franchise amoung castlevania final fantasy legacy of kain and zelda since re  the series has always been a blast but there have always been a few compliants awekward static camera angles polygon characters dont look good on prerendered backgrounds and the pivoting control style was always irritating
until code veronica re  was my favorite of the series but code veronica took what was working with resident evil and improved on most of the aspects of it
mostly this gamess dreamcast incarnation was revolutionary for its time
re cv on the dc was the first game of the current generation to blow me away graphically and started a new trend in game cinemas relying on realt time cut scenes rather than pre rendered ones
the only thing that prevents me from giving this game the perfect score it couls have gotten was the blasted control scheme which has got to go
cv has a moving camera the characters move along real time polygonla backgrounds that still look amazing even though the characters look outdated now compared to final fantasy x metal gear solid  and just about any gamecube titlethe ps  version adds about ten minutes of footage to the game including a spectacular final battle between chris and wesker that was just great
the graphics actually look a little worse in some spots than the dreamcast version as the ps  aliasing problem rears its ugly head on occasion but its nothing thats really unbearable and the extras this game has makes it worthwhile if and only if you dont already own the dc version of the game
the sound on the ps  version is enhanced however and the game is a bit darker which is a good thing but aside form that well let me put it this way the dc guide book will get you through cvx
item placement is the same sectret codes are the same etc
if you dont already have the dreamcast version do yourself a favor and pick this one up as its the last resident evil excluding the re online game which will not be a part of the time line that will appear on a nonnintendo systemi would have given code veronica x a  if possible since it is almost near to perfect however the  will do for nowthe game has a great storyline but the graphics look rather choppy
while veronica x offers nothing very much to the others in the series it is still a great game and a musthave for re fansvery good addition to the resident evil series a little diferent from the past games but veri good in therms of history and gameplaypros  incredibly intense and difficult
great graphics and intelligent creatures
a whole lot of gameplay
takes about  hours to i beat unlike the rest that took around   an awesome arsenal of weapons that each have different effects on creaturescons  its really hard to maneuver with your character
once a creature gets near you theres no chance
very limited supplies when it comes to ammo and herbs
without a lot of herbs youre as good as dead towards the end of the game
it is impossible to outrun one of the bosses at the end even when thats what youre supposed to do
he kills you in  hitsbottom line  if you love resident evil get this game
if you dont then get devil may crywhen u write a review for a game theres a  word maximumsorry but a thousand words just doesnt fully describe how fantastic this game really is and the only reason i gave it  stars instead of  is because i wanted to see claire redfield in a thongbut hey other than that the game rocksive been an re fan ever since the first one came out for the first playstationand been hooked on it ever since i even saw the moviewhich in fact i was extremely skeptical aboutbut the movie turned out excellent a very well done motion pictureleaving you hanging at the thought of a sequalresident evil project nemesisthats what i see them calling itthe added cut scenes and enhanced graphics they made specifically for the ps is astonishing making you get sucked into a deep dark world since minute one all the way to the finale awesome weapons with great gameplay and convincing storylinewhat more can you ask forthe game shouldve been a little longer though i might add resident evilcodename veronica x is most definitelywithout a doubt in my mindthe king of all rd person actionadventure survival horror games to ever walk the face of the earth if the gameplay storyline and creatures from the dead dont scare you away from this gamethen i know at least the soundtrack will guaranteed and for a game that is now  brand spankin new its totally worth it and even if it wasnt then it would still be worth every penny u spend and i cant wait until the next one if there is onei have a feeling itll be on the next psand since theyd be enhancing the already strong bit system to bitim strongly assuming the next resident evil will more than likely be a cgi based interactive cinematic type of platformu could sayalmost virtual reality cept without all the dark shaded glasses that looks like it just got beemed down from star trek voyagerbut this game is definitely one for the librarydont miss itin  lots of gamers were complaining about the resident evil franchise becoming stale  and with good reason
the treasure box and tanklike movements of the characters remained fairly consistant through the first generation of re games
although i never tired of the series i was   and today would gladly take them over the sorry excuse for the new generation of re games code veronica x seems to keep that same formula but adds a fresh breath of air to the gaming experiencecode veronica x starts out with claire in a prison cell when suddenly the guard is killed and the cell is opened
you must use your lighter to find weapons and clues and finally burst out onto the lawn where a cemetery of undead begin to drool all over you
you realize that the nightmare has never ended  it has just relocated
the graphics and gameplay look very much like a late s windows pc game but thankfully on the ps version some of that goes away gamecube version retains the pclike graphics
the game is exciting but requires attention to detail
as a young gamer i was really turned off by this game it was too hard and nothing made sense
there are some crucial puzzles in the first half hour of the game that will leave the fainthearted shutting off their consoles and tiring of the game hint  you must duplicate the metal object into a polycarbonate and deposit the real metal object into the bin to keep the alarms from going off
i would actually say theres less action and more strategy to this game  although it sure picks up the pace later on
the great thing about this game is that you dont stay on the island youre on
once the island is desolated with zombie corpses and only fires and whispers remain you actually travel to another continent to do more research
and once youre there that is when the game gets extremely exciting and you cant put your controller downyou have a partner who helps you a little throughout the game
steve is a very embarassing character saying corny lines and thinking hes a hot shot
claire wont have any of it
that kid with a gun is dangerous
later on you hear his back story and he becomes less annoying and a tad entertaining
dont get too attached though  you may find yourself in troublewhen the game ends you breathe a sigh of relief
you feel as if the game has resolved itself and its not underwhelming like some games
code veronica x keeps in traditional resident evil form by having an epic ending and replay value
this is probably the last true resident evil game in the series
its both great and depressing at the same timei played through this game just once and while i loved it i dont know how long it will be until i do it againfor the first time since re it wont be for a whilethat really upsets me for this game is amazing
the graphics are very good the voice acting is great the story is incredible its longer and imo scarier than its predecessors chris redfeild is coolway unlike in re the soundtrack is brilliantly composed and the puzzles are inhumanly well thought out
i know if youve read any of my countless reviews before you know im not one for capitalizing things its just that this game is besides the difficulties which i will mention later is quite possibly the greatest game ever madebefore i go more into depth with the good aspects i just want to explain why only a four star rating
as i stated several times before its the difficulties
i have almost never played a game as frustrating as this game is
bullets are very scarce and so are health revivers
some of the puzzles require an hour or two of thinking as some of them are just so advanced that they are mind boggling
the bosses are much harderor at least more resource consuming same with the hunters and the spiders even the zombies too require much more to kill and do greater damage
this game keeps a number of times you die in the memory banks and i died i think it was  times
i commonly ran out of ammo during the last boss and i dreaded the idea of restarting over because of it
this game isnt really fun its just incredibly well thought out and entertaininghowever i will state that the music plot and puzzle setup which completely obsoletes that of re easily alone justify a four star rating
this is obviously the most nicely hollywoodish entry to the already very hollywoodish series
the story digs deep into that of the birth of umbrella as it also prepells you further into the future
you start off as claire on an island that belonged to umbrellauntil it was mysteriously attacked and the tvirus is unleashed
on the island she meets fellow inmate survivor steve a real pest with a high pitched voice
steve while a rather ratty and simple character does grow on you very effectively and twice he generates very emotional scenes one right after you first play him and the second is at the end
both of those scenes were very well acted directed and the music for both scenes is superb to say the leastlater chris is told by leon where claire is while he always manages to stay a step behind her he eventually finds her and escapeonly to return again in some other sequel later
chris however is being stalked by wesker who survived re and is mad as hell
as to why he is mad at chris i have no idea
the other villains though the ashfords are much sicker than wesker birkin even vincent from resurvivor
they play the mccoyhatfeild scenario with the redfeilds in what i believe to be one of the ultimate tales of good vs evil ever told
one of the greatest moments in gaming history is typing in the final selfdestruction code veronicathis game is unforgettable as it is both a great game and a fantastic adventure
true sometimes you will get too scared or very frustrated but those are the only letdowns
trust me as you could see with my insanely long review that this game is a keeper
get this game
get it nowbeing with not a lot of weapon support was kinda upsetting
however the sloppy controls were still there but the graphics were killer resident evil still keeps me on my feetthose who loved and enjoyed beating the original code veronica for the dreamcast really shouldnt bother with this ps edition which isnt really all that of a special edition
the only differences are that the graphics have been tweaked a little although there are parts of the game where some of the graphics are rather choppy and are outshined by the dc version and additional cut scenes that explain some plot holes from the original version
other than that this is still a great game but if you played the original code veronica this really wont do much for you
all in all if youve never played code veronica before and you own a ps this is a good addition to your game library but if you own the original version there is no point in getting thisgreat but not perfecti have personally been a fan of all resident evils ever made
unfortunately resident evil  was a bit lacking in gameplay and depth
resident code veronica x is the oppositegood graphics solid story and gameplay and adevil may cry demo say it all
as with all other games in this series it is a bit slow but you can expect that in all survival horror gamesi dont have a dreamcast so i never played the original code veronica and this game was considered the best re from reviewers and i am a rabid re fan so i had to get this game
yes this game has amazing graphics with polygonal environments accompanied by a moving camera but most of the times the camera stays stillgiving you the feeling youre still looking at prerendered backgrounds and you still have monsters offscreen while the stupid camera doesnt want to move
also the graphics are plagued by an abundance of unnecessary fog so you can only see  or  feet in front of you
this is ridiculous because theres also fog inside buildings and is absolutely not a graphical style
personally i think onimusha looks better
one thing capcom got right is sound and it is right on and the story is credible with acceptable voice actingonce you get used to steve and claires pornomoan quotoh stevequot i would also like to add about damage done to enemieszombies arent breakable as they were in the past res
for example when you blow a zombies head off blow his legs off his arm is ripped off while you shrug him off youre neck and blowing half his body off so only his upper half comes crawling at you
in this game none of these things happen recvx only has a sharper sound effect if you blow his head off  and his head is still intact
another thing is that the zombie sounds are still the same from the first re so dont expect anything different
overall i would still consider this to be a worthwile re and probably the best but it would only win by a fingernail against rewhich was innovative to say the least
pick this one up if youre a rabid re fan and for the devil may cryawesome gamedemoresident evil code veronica was originally released on the sega dreamcast
it had been in development alongside resident evil  but code veronica featured completely d backgrounds and an original story
the game follows claire redfield as she is imprisoned by umbrella in an unknown island
things quickly go to hell when there is a tvirus outbreakcode veronica x is the playstation  port with added features and  minutes of extra cutscenes
the graphics are nice and solid and the music is pretty good at setting the mood
there are a lot of minor improvements to the series such as the quick turn around better item placement and story progression
the game is longer than previous resident evils and i read somewhere that the game area is bigger than both resident evil and resident evil  combinedthis game is way better than resident evil  returning characters claire chris and wesker make this game feel familiar and the added enemies and villains are good additions
one of the few weaknesses is the character steve a corny dimensional character that tries to be otfabs
well at least he makes for a good story element later in the game
the atmosphere is darker closer to the original game than the cartoony re
still i wish the graphics were moodier because theyre not nearly as gritty as silent hillthere are a couple of parts in code veronica that will test your skills and you might actually get stuck
ive seen people get stuck at the airplane section with the tyrant getting thoroughly owned with limited ammo
i played through the game with my bro last year and we did pretty good until we reached the final boss
we had no  ammo so we had to knife the crap out of it
it was a losing battle but with perserverance and several shots of tequila we weakened the trik and took her out
haha i still remember that what an accomplishment
that has to be one of my best gaming moments
code veronica is not classic like re but it does have its moments that still make it worth playingcode veronica x is without a doubt the hardest resident evil game in the franchise to date and that includes the most recent addition resident evil 
this playstation  version is an improvement over the sega dreamcast version mainly because of longer cutscenes that help to explain the backstory of the umbrella corporation and albert weskers involvementthere are a lot of monsters and bosses in this game  some are extremely hardy and take a lot of effort to defeat others can simply be ignored to save your ammunition for later trust me youll be needing all of itit doesnt have the same scares as the first few versions there are not many moments that will grab you and chill you to the bone as the first resident evil did on the orignial playstationso what makes a resident evil fan a true fantwo words rocket launcherits commonly known amongst resident evil fans that by finishing a resident evil game within a set time limit you are rewarded with uberweaponry to use during your next playthrough
the rewards depending on the resident evil game you finish can be anything from a laser to a magnum with limitless rounds  but the common link between all of them is the ability to earn a rocket launchercapcom decided to make it extremely difficult to obtain the rocket launcher in code veronica x here are the requirements like them or loathe them to get itduring the course of the game you cannot use any first aid sprays you cannot use the retry
option you cannot save your game except for one free save halfway through the game you must save your partner character steve quickly from one of the trap rooms you must give a hemostat medicine bottle to a secondary character and most importantly you must finish the entire game in under  hours and  minutes
watching movie cutscenes counts against your timethese are the most stringent demands to ever be put upon a resident evil playerin my humble opinion capcom almost made this too hard
a player has to be extremely sparing with ammunition as every single bullet counts
it is clearly stated in the instruction manual to avoid as many zombiesmonsters as possible to conserve your rounds for the bigger dangers that surely lay ahead and having to save bullets when you dont know whats coming is a difficult task the first time aroundalso lets consider that time limit
most gamers may not have a  hour block of uninterrupted time to finish a game and i mean completely uninterrupted
pausing the game will not stop the clock from ticking  it only stops after the last credit has rolledthere are at least  moments in this game where the player will have to face a moment of live or die
this means a player could be more than  of the way through the game get killed in a trap and would have to start over again from the halfway point
i can honestly say that this is the most infuriating part of code veronica x  while quite a few gamers will finish some will never attempt to replay to earn the rocket launcherthe camera angles are also an annoyance
set backgrounds with a rd person character cause a lot of frustration because your character can be in a room that looks clear take  steps and be within arms reach of  zombies that you never saw because of the camera angleif youre a true survival horror fan this game is bound to keep you entertained and youll have many hours of replay ahead of you trying to earn the rocket launcherfor the brand new survivalist it would be best to try resident evil   or  before gnashing your teeth into code veronica x its best to learn to crawl before you walkhappy huntingthis game is simply marveloussss
the controls are worth dying for hehehehepoor poor pretty little redhead claire
pulled into umbrella corpssss scheme in raccoon city
she starts out locked in a tiny little cell frees herself and ventures up into the outside world above her
her brother chris redfield is also featured as a playable character
ah yes the more the merrierdid i mention how wonderful these controls areso slow we are to catch them would have been disappointing but these control buttonssss make it all the easier for us
watch as the players in frustration try to move one of these dinnerdelights from our range
so slowly shall they turn just to step away from us that we latch onto their legs if were close enough
whats even better yet is that the more of us around the bigger the banquet
hehehe
a game that is fair to us undeadlets not forget the weaponssss nowsome of those dastardly weapons like the guns can be a painful and quick end to zombies
but weapons such as knives are useless
these pitiful cheap weapons do little to no damage to our kin and oh yes it makes it easy to swarm those two lively creatures and take them down with ease
the player is better off running away from us than using a knife to fight
oh but how delightful the producers were in making ammo scarce
a wise player would conserve their ammo if all possibleour environment is drank dark and eerietheres a tension of any of us popping up for a visit at any time
did i mention that we can interact with backgrounds
so dont feel ssssafe behind a glassssss window
some areas are visibly hard to see in as well
a sudden noise an absent dripping fountain a terrified scream or a dead body being dragged into a gap are one of the several aspects in our homeah yes the enemies of the livingof course there is the zombie virus
plentiful slow creatures they are that are powerful in groups
lets not forget about a zombies best friend
dogs are agileaggressive creatures that will chase any living being down
but it gets even better
earthshaking worms that burrow themselves under the ground that enjoy the game of hidenseek
then there is the mutated monsters
these creatures have a tendency of longrange attacks and can quickly popup in gaps that the other undead simply wouldnt survive
so many terrorsss so little timemysterious plotssssnow now im not one to give spoilers out but wouldnt you the player want to know whats going on
this is the feeling that comes from this game
given the option of digging deeper or try to find the quickest way possible out of raccoon city
the choice is yours
but dont venture off to ssssoonwed rather enjoy the companygreatest hits need i say more
but why settle just for this when you can have the essentials edition
this game is for any humanor ghoulbut instead i bought it i some how had to have this game  yes its an old game and the story is little tired but some of the puzzles made me actually think duuuuhhhhi love challanges even if doged silent hill i will say this 
i found balance in this game  as for the bosses i like the fact that you had to run from some or simply throw some off a plane ectresident evil has limited movement so the battles are lacking in that respect it would have been torture to run around and kill all the bosses so it was creative to change that aspect of the game  the camera angles can fustrate you at times but
we have grow to accept these set backs a trade mark from capcom all in all this game is not so bad actually its easy it took me  hours to completeor i get all my game late i am not as fortunate an usa gamer it cost me tt for a game where i live so when i buy
it must worth it
so people your reviews means a lot to me laterzzzzzzzi gave the original silent hill  stars and believe it to be the best horror game ive ever played
though i finished that game over  years ago there are still scenes that come to mind and give me chills
silent hill  falls short of that experience but is the creepiest ps game out theremany of the mosters dont as much look to be spawned from hell as welded together from spare parts
this is a different look and quite effective
also many of the monsters in sh have acquired a nervous twich somewhat reminiscent of the demons in the film jacobs ladder
seeing a deformed twiching nurse coming at you wielding a steel pipe will make you wonder what youre doing in this crazy town in the first placealmost all of the puzzles made sense though there were a couple of stumpers that made me look for a walkthroughthe game is brimming with creepy sounds but i often wondered why particular sounds were played in particular areas it seemed like the creepiest sounds were played in the areas that furthered the ploti wasnt left with as many questions as after the first game but there is still a lot left unanswered not that i was expecting otherwise
the game is pretty short however
i clocked in at just under  hoursoverall the game accomplished what it set out to do
when i turned off the game at night and walk through the dark house on my way to bed there was the slightest fear that a deformed twitching nurse was right behind me ready to clock me with a steel pipesilent hill  is what survival horror should be where players must use their minds rather than reflexes
in much the same style as the original silent hill much of your time is spent searching solving puzzles and fetching particular items
the action is toned down when compared to resident evil and it is just as wellthe centerpiece of the game is the story
you are james who has just recieved a lettr from his wife saying that she will meet him in the resort town of silent hill
the odd thing is that she has been dead for three years
that is just the beginning of what will become a very strange and nightmareish journey
gunplay is exchanged for problem solving which gives gamers a much needed challengethe first silent hill was fantastic and the sequel makes no exceptions
the graphics are amazing with the trademark use of fog adding to the surreal and frightening atmosphere
the sound is also to die for obviously much time was spent tweaking the music so it matches each scene perfectly
the biggest improvement however is the control
if there was one flaw with the first game it is the impossible controls which made combat clunky and frustrating
it is much better herealthough the fights themselves are not too difficult the puzzles are
i have gotten stuck more than a few times and had to retread in areas to look for things i missed
this can be a bit frustrating but i always found my way out
players who rush through games hoping for the cool moments wont last long
in silent hill  you need to be on your toes and missing a detail can mean hours of scratching your head wondering how to proceedlike the first game sh can be beaten in a week
but there are multiple endings and multiple outcomes to different situations
these are determined by your actions during the game and you will find yourself playing a few times over in an attempt to see what new things your can find
games with replay value are the best kind in my opinioneven though the silent hill series is only in its second installment it already has the potential to be a big one like the resident evil series
i only hope that future installments are as good as thissilent hill  is the scariest video game ive ever played
while the game does have flaws it undoubtedly excells at the horror genre
if youre looking for a gorey action game ala resident evil then stick to the capcom games
silent hill  isnt about using bazookas and flamethrowers to pulverize halpess zombies
in fact resident evil is like a walk in the park when compared to the incredibly messed up stuff waiting for you in the quaint little lakeside resort town silent hillso the good news first
the graphics in silent hill  are absolutely incredible
james and the other members of the cast are incredibly lifelike and fairly complex as far as video game characters go
the voice acting and for that matter the script isnt exactly metal gear solid quality but its certainly better than anything offered by capcoms various monster franchises
the real kicker with this game though is the ambiance
silent hill s quotfilm grainquot look was much touted and it really is amazing
the experience of playing this game is the equivalent to being in your favorite horror thriller
take for instance the following scene james and maria an elevator within the positively nightmarish silent hill hospital
everything seems normal and safe within the elevator when james radio suddenly starts picking up what sounds like a game show
all of the sudden a horrific quiz show comes booming over the speakers
sound weird
well you happen to be the contestant
to accept your prize all you have to do is see whats behind mystery door number one
a word to the wise you wont like the prizenow for the bad
first and foremost is the unguided aspect of the game
basically silent hill  has you searching an entire city for well you dont really know
the obscurity of your quests can be a little frustrating at times
the game is also sectioned off into quotlevelsquot meaning once youve entered the aforementioned hospital you cant leave until youve found everything there is to discover
all of this though pales to the biggest problem of all the fog
creepy
sure
disorienting
yeah
overdone
absolutely
there is so much fog in silent hill that you can barely see two feet in front of you
wondering through fog isnt as much scary as it is just plain boring
for the amount of graphical detail added to the interiors of the city youd think that more detail could be added to the city itself
lastly this game can be a bit slow at times
the games intro for example has you wondering around aimlessly for practically fifteen minutes before you encounter anything of a real significance
stick with it though because this game definatley delivers once you get into it
just pray you can make it out aliveconfusion is criticle to maintaining silent hills atmosphere so those complaining that the story is confusing knock it off its meant to bethere are a lot of questions id like answered but thankfully konami has created a game that leaves you walking away just as disturbed as confused
the only game that could surpass silent hill in the disturbing arena is silicon knights forth comming eternal darknesssilent hill  addresses the complaints i had about the first one the option to have a point and go there control style is there
so i just go no pivoting
the problem is that the camera was not designed for this control method and so it has a few quirks
nothing too drastically bad but it really needed work
its sadly not as disturbing as the first one though it seems that konami has bent to the will of irresponsible parents blamming games for thier kids problems and toned the game down dramatically from what it was
over all though the game is still a good renterthe reason i recomend renting this is because there is a directors cut in the works for xbox that is comming out soon
it will have much more material than this one and while i hate it when people do directors cuts its nice that konami announced that they were going to do this in time enough to stop me from buying the ps version
ill be able to get the definitive version right off the bat rather than wasting my money on an incomplete gamesilent hill  is probably one of the best survivor horror games for the playstation  if not the best
it starts out slow and a little boring but once you get past the apartment buildings the pace picks up a bit and the closer you get to the end the more fun it ismy only beef is that although the storyline is much clearer than the first silent hill its nowhere as scary
it still captures the moodiness and mystery but only a quarter of the fear
when playing the first game i was terrified out of my wits
silent hill  plays more like the resident evil series with straightforward monsters which you have to kill provided you have ammo
its not until later with nightmare versions of the town that the old silent hill touch comes into play  but even then its not as intenseall in all it is a game thats worth buying but if youre a big silent hill fan just keep your expectations down a bit and youll have fun
the endings are great too all  of them so keep workingthis game is scary and has the best plot of the series
the levels are as cool as the other  though
the cutscenes are awsome and the eerie sound effects rock
fighting is to easy and the puzzles arent too hard
too much back tracking
last longer than the other  and lasts about  and a half hours
you dont need to know about anything that happened in the first one to understand this game
the graphics are pretty good but you cant tell sometimes because of the fog and darkness so dont buy it because it has good graphicsi played this game directly after i finished the first in the series
while it isnt as outright scary as the first game it effects a nice sense of personal and psychological horror akin to movies like session  or jacobs ladder in fact jacobs ladder was one of the inspirations for the seriesthe game looks beautiful for its age and the musical compositions are superb
the characters are wellwritten and acting for the most part although sometimes the main character james was hard for me to take seriously
the monsters are also disturbing and welldesigned
the town is rendered beautifully despite a thick fog obscuring your vision for more than a few meters
indoor environments are also very nicely doneas for gameplay the constant map checking can get fairly irritating
controls are standard for survival horror but will probably take getting used to if youre new to the genre since they are very clunky
in fact this is the one place where the game and survival horror in general fall flat but lets be honest if youre playing silent hill youre either playing it for the scares or the storylinetotal play time on your first play without a faq or guide will probably run you  hours
the three endings bonus ending joke ending and if you get the greatest hits version ufo ending give the game replay valuethis game is one of my favorites out of my collection
i highly recommend ita few friends of mine told me that the original silent hill was so scary that they were afraid to play it
then when the sequel came out one said that someone could only play it for an hour at a time until it started to mess with their mind
when i recieved it for christmas another dared me to play it with the lights off
well let me tell you i was disappointed with the original
i thought the graphics were really grainy and the controls were clunky
plus im the first and third person shooter type so naturally i didnt like the crummy combat and scarce powerups
silent hill  is nominally better
the controls are still clunky and i wonder if konami will ever make it possible to jump in their games
the graphics voice acting plot and hero are all much cooler though
in addition one gets somewhat used to the controls with some practicethe original games story didnt have much originality
great they find an abandoned baby and wouldnt you know it she disappears into silent hill drawn by a strange force
the plot behind the sequel is awesome getting a letter from a late spouse meeting someone who looks exactly like her and knows everything about her and many more twists
i also like the option of choosing to play the game as a morbid version of myst excising combat altogether although i havent taken that path
it took me a little while to discover that there actually is an introduction to this game but this time one has to keep the title screen on and wait a couple minutes for it to start
its worth the wait by the way
the sequel is definitely scarier
i mean fighting those mutant pterodactyls and dogs in the first game was kinda lame
the dwarves with the carving knives were probably the scariest but they only made me angry with wasting my ammunition
silent hill s humanoid freaks that look like theyre wrapped in tight bloody plastic look much cooler especially when they spray that acid
some of them crawl with frightening speed and jump out from under cars when one gets too close
later butchered mannequins try to attack the player and they are even more disturbing and seamlessly crafted
the puzzles are meant for intelligent minds and i like not being treated like an idiot
as with the original i still think that the radio takes away the surprise of the monsters and therefore most of the scare
but if i were actually searching for my late wife in a mutantinfested town i would probably appreciate it though i would appreciate a few drums of napalm tooall in all i am satisfied with the game even if it is not based on heartstopping inyourface action
its a definite improvement over the original and i am very eager to complete it and find out just what the hell is going on in silent hilli still have to say the origianl silent hill was more engrossing than this one
the plot in the first game was highly complex but every character you meet ties in with the main story somwhat and its apparent that they do so within several playthroughs
this is not to say that game runs out of steam since more appreication comes with every subsequent game play
silent hill  on the other hand did not do so with its characters
you wonder a bit why you meet some of the character as their story almost has nothing to do with james sunderland the main characters quest
there could be an argument for some moral reason why james meets eddie the edgy out of towner who seems to get trapped in bad situations every time they meet or angela the girl who needs help that james probably cannot provide
what im saying is that you shouldnt have to work so hard to get a game to be enjoyable
especially if you paid fifty dollars for the right to do so
i found the storythough tragicfall flat by the games end
in all fairness i should say that it falls flat in comparision to my expectations since it is the sequel to probably the best ps survivial horror storyline
the story did not tie together at the end and the fact that the main character seems to have conviently forgotten an important detail about what happened to his wife until the last  minutes of gameplay is almost annoying
his reaction to certain key events is inconsistant with this quotforgottenquot detail and leaves you wondering quotwhat is wrong with you james
quot  there were not enough details that directly tied to the story and too much not tying into anything during the first three game plays
a good game should give you a good experience the first and everytime you play not just after you beat every ending and its the th time youve playedcontrols were good with this game
there were no big weapons to be found anywhere but that is a little more realistic since james is a civilian
that is not to say that the weapons are boring
several weapons are fun to play with but presents differnt challaneges to the user to make it interesting expeically the great knife
you can customize the level of difficulty of the action as well as the puzzles so you can choose to play a cerebrial game or a survivial gamethe graphics are a great improvment over the second game
the more smooth movies are in corporated right in with game play screens but the loading time between the two are a bit annoying and breaks up the story a bitthe music is top knotch creating the perfect mood for the game and actually corrosponds with action
if some nurse is waiting for you around the corner you near the music rising like the hair in the back of your neckthe music could not overcome the other qualms i have with this game and i did not feel the game quotget under my skinquot so to speak
overall its recommended   i wish they did a lot more with this since i expected so much moresilent hill is regarded the best sh game ever probably because it strays away from occult storyline of sh   and  the story is much more involving and touches the heart of many gamers who are used to emotional plotlines of japanese rpgs
storyline character development and plot matters to most gamers so it is fitting that sh  deserves praise because it has the most cohorent plot of all seriesyou play james sunderland who received a letter from his wife requesting him to meet her at a quotspecial placequot
the mysterious thing is that she was dead  years ago
along the game there is little of pandemonium horrors of sh  and  or nightmare descending into hell of sh  the whole game has melancholic depressing feel to it and the horror is more akin to creeping your skin
the jason of this game is pyramid head and instead of all out assault on your protagonist like resident evils nemesis his forebrooding presence not to mention his fetishness for mannequin legs will stop your dead on your tracks
some commented how the game is least frightening of all series
you will need to play this game in complete silence and darkness to fully absorb the horrors of sh  my only complaint is that the game is too short and the optional maria quest can be beaten in  minutessilent hill  for the sony playstation  is more creepy and scary than one would call it pure enjoyment
where this has the goods youd expect as a silent hill title the creepy scary atmosphere it also has the bad stuff you saw from the first game backandforth searching and backtrackinggraphically the game is topnotch
the sound and ambience completely accompanies the horrorfied backgrounds
the thick fog and the pocketsized flashlight for your walks in the dark are back
the enemies are very original and creepy
where most are meerly there to scare you rather then make you fight them there can be a very violent battle or two if you do choose to tangle
puzzles are here and there but nothing too complicated and the levels of puzzle difficulty can be adjustedsome problems one can have with this game is its backtracking and mindless wandering
you end up going backandforth in silent hill far too often to make this a perfectly enjoyable title
the voiceovers could be better but they arent all that bad and are a much improvement over the first silent hill
also the camera angles tend to not be in your favor at times
too often enemies are in a blind spot and cannot be seen until its too latewill this game scare you
you bet it will
because of this its mature themes and because it offers nothing to children its strickly an adult game
the excellent storyline will suck you right into this game and the creepy atmosphere will keep you on the edge of your seatthe game is grade a creepy
the music  fog is great  really set the mood
the creepy no headed creatures looked odd  goofey rather then scary but were disturbing none the less i jumped once when i was walking past a car  one of those things slide out from under the car  raced around for a bit
the radio that lets you know the devil bad guyslol is coming
it adds much suspense especially when you cant see them through the thick fog
the sounds remind me of somthing youd hear from a evil dead movie
i was waiting for come join us
that would have been rad they didnt talk
it was more like tortured screams hellish yells  feet dragingthe bad part is the fact that most of the background is not interactive
i swing  gates  my bar or whatever its called goes right through it
the same goes for most objects which i found phoney  fake
you can even walk up hills or walk over the dead monsters you killed at times
you must walk over them
although having bloody foot prints is pretty cool when walking past a creature you just killed
the game keeps you from wandering off to explore
i hate that
you have a premade set path to follow
you cant stray from the straight  narrow
i wish it had a vice city vibe to it with more interaction
have a few people in town
it can get slow at times so action gamers will not like this type of game
its a bit slow but its creepy  keeps me very interested
i seldom watch cut scenes but in this game i look forward to it
you really put yourself in the characters shoes
you actually care that he finds out what happened to his dead wife
i just wish james would scream in terror  have expressions when seeing whats going around himi dont know but it just didnt live up to the hype for me
although silent hill  is a great horror game
i just couldnt connect and the combat was so awkward at times the mood was over lapsed with mild frustration but i did enjoy it to some extent
what separates it from the other silent hills
first off the soundtrack for sh is akira yamoaka at his best
its seriously one of the greatest things ive heard in a video game
some songs are most memorable and liked by many
also the immersion is awesome in this game
it doesnt hold your hand which requires the player to explore the town and find out how to get to the next objective
that involves solving puzzles finding keys and crafting stuff to acquire key items
very neat
last but not least pyramid head
of course
this enemy is like a stalking presence that follows you the whole story and you dont know when he will strike next
there were times i really didnt want to explore a room or hallway because the heart stopping music would start and it felt like he was near
then nothing
other times absolute silence then there he is chasing you with a spear to stick you in the back
ouch
very well done and this was something that really impressed me
then the final showdown with two pyramid heads accompanied by intense music was cake
amazing
one last thing i really appreciated about silent hill  over the others is that it doesnt include all the occult demonic mumbo jumbo the other installments harp on throughout the story
not everyone likes that kind of junk thrown in their face when trying to play a video game and im one of them
so major plus there
alright on to dislikeswhat was mentioned above the combat just frustrated me at times
swinging weapons at enemies only to hit walls again and again
while the enemy just stood there and smacked me to death
did i mention most confrontations take place in tight hallways or small rooms
im a big melee person when it comes to horror games so definitely a personal dislike
konami has improved this over the years with recent installments
guns on the other hand are great and get the job done
there is also an over abundance of ammo throughout the town so i never felt the need to conserve which did subtract some survival aspect to my over all experience
going back to melee though where are all the weapons
all i picked up was a wooden plank and a pipe
a character gives james a knife but when trying to equip it for use he refuses to do so
also you can steal pyramid heads sword from his room
i personally loled at this
its fun to swing around like youre all that but its slow awkward and will most likely hit a wall when attacking enemies making it utterly useless
funny none the less
also the chainsaw is the same way
awkward slow and isnt fast enough for attacking
for some strange reason it just shuts off when james is attacked or isnt in combat stance too
which isnt how a chainsaw works in real life
so yeah meleecombat was my biggest gripe with sh
theres just not enough weapons in sh and barely any unlockables like in other games
and what weapons you do get just arent that cool minus that buster sword xd anywho ive overkilled the point already but yeah it just bothered me that much
there were other things that effects my rating a little like the awkward scripts for the characters when they interacted with each other
kind of ruined the atmosphere
also i didnt care for most the characters in the first place except for saving a certain companion named maria
but all that aside this was a great game i highly recommend
final verdict hope this helpsthe silent hill series has been often thought of as konamis answer to capcoms resident evil games
while it is true that they share many similarities silent hill has surpassed resident evil in its disturbing environments and character design in my opinion
silent hill  has the same foggy dingy rustfilled atmosphere as the original but with much clearer graphics and a different story
you play as james sunderland who receives a letter from his supposedly dead wife beckoning him to return to silent hill
the events that follow will pit you against bizarre enemies puzzles and confusing plot twists worthy of a stephen king novel
the gameplay is still a bit slow and stiff but silent hill  is more about delivering a terrifing experience than about action packed gameplay
the weapon roster remains realistic but formidable ranging from a wooden board to a hunting rifle
the only obvious drawback is the multiple endingsnone of them ever give a clear explanation as to what was really going on in the town perhaps the player is intended to make their own conclusion
other than that silent hill  is a must buy for those who love the survival horror genrei rented this game thank god i didnt buy it because everybody said it was the scariest game ever made
well i dont consider running for hours scary
once in a while there is some kind of monster thing that wonders around
best thing to do is run right past them or ignore them if you can
not scary
the scariest part of the game is when the characters interact with each other
great graphics and great voice acting make them very creepy
the graphics are great but there is a serious problem with the overuse of fog
i know the creators were going for a certain look but it makes the game incredibly difficult to play when you cant see two feet in front of you
another problem is the camera
it always seems to be in the worst possible place
you have to keep moving it and even then you cant get it right
aside from the games problems and the fact that its not scary the game is enjoyable to play as a puzzle game and its worth the rental just to see the cool graphics
the game would be a lot better without the fog
heres what i give it out of a perfect graphics  bad fogsound  great soundcontrol  bad camerafun factor  fun gamesilent hill  is probably one of the bets survival horrorgames ever madeyou play as james sunderland whose wife mary hasjust died  years ago or so it seems
james receivesa letter from his dead wife asking him to meet her inthe sleepy resort town of silent hillthe game plays just like the original silent hillbut the graphics and sound are much better andso is the gameplayit is much more scarier and atmospheric as wellesp
when you are exploring abandoned buildingsand silent hill outside at nightimethe enemies are really creepy and scary
thereare items to find throughout the games such ashealth drinks first aid kits many weapons andammo for them as well as melee weapons whichdont require ammothe town of silent hill has many areas to explore thoughon a somewhat liner but thrilling path
areas includevarious outdoor locations an apartment complex anabandoned hospital silent hill historical societytulca prison the lakeview hotel and a few otherlocations  including nightmarealternate versionsof said areas and locations
you also have a mapbut can only see it if you have access to light or aflashlightjames has a flashlight he will get eventually as wellas a radio
the flashlight is good for exploring in darkplaces and the radio emits static when enemies arenearbythe boss fights are not that hard except on hard difficultylevel
on normal and easy they are a piece of cake almostthe storyline has some interesting characters in it butit is hard for some people to understand and requiresreading some online material from silent hill websitesin order to understandthere are multiple ending for people that play throughthe game multiple times in different ways as well as somebonus weapons like a chainsaw and hyperspray when playingthe game a nd time and beyondthe cutscenes and voice acting are well done throughoutthe gameall in all this is a good but short took me  hours to beatfirst time through second and third times and beyond only hours that is really creepy scary and has an intenseatmosphere about itif you like silent hill games or resident evil ones evenalan wake i recommend this gamesilent hill although not my personal favorite silent hill gamehate mebut i love silent hill is still very goodand is loved by alot of gamers
the gameplay is greatjust as it isin all the sh gamesthere are multiple endingstheres the creepiness that only a sh game can bringand the graphics are very good
especially the cutscenes
they are very realistic lookingand this being an older gameahead of their time as well
overallnot my personal fav shbut this game does belong in everyones silent hill video game collectionat first when i heard all the hype about the game and decided to give it a try
the graphics are almost realistic just under the level of the final fantasy movie
the creatures are bizarre in a good way and the human characters are almost more creepy than the creaturesin my eyes there is a downfall now dont get me wrong i enjoy games where you do some aimless wandering around im a big fan of the tomb raider and metal gear games and they have a lot of that but the downfall is this takes it to the extremeanother thing is is the lighting is very very very dark and in some cases even non existenti like the game a lot but it does have a few drawbacks
and from time to time the activity within the game is like watching grass growit doesnt hit you upside the head with a tackhammer like the first game but draws you in quietly
almost teases you with terror if i can invent a crappy new phrase
interaction with quotfriendlyquot npcs is more emphasized than the first game which slows down the pacing a bit but forces you to invest more emotionally in the events
i really applaud the designers attempts to flesh out the story and deal with some rather mature i mean quotcomplexquot mature not quotsouth parkquot mature themes while at last attempting to explain some of the nearly inexplicable supernatural dynamics of the cursed town
the bonus game is brilliant playing out marias parallel story as a confused antagonist seems at first contradictory but eventually far more terrifying than anything in the main game
realizing that youre playing not as a faceless evildoer but as a lost soul controlled by a greater evil force really strengthens the foundation under the entire seriesif onlyas much effort were put into the gameplay as the story
the new true d outdoor engine is nice although it pushes the ps past its drawing limits
collison detection is still clumsy but forgiveable because of the slow footspeed of every enemy
speaking of which there are only about five relatively unscary enemy types and you see them all within the first third of the game
too many of the environments are recycled from sh which in itself is not bad but there is a real apathy in game design where sameold lock and key puzzles leave you feeling more like an apartment supe checking on his tenants than an adventure gamer
the apartment complex especially drags and the hospital just didnt freak me out like sh
the game nearly falls apart during the historical society buildings grand sewage expedition not scary or disturbing very frustrating and disorienting
i spent a good portion of my game time wandering pointlessly in this maze eventually emerging and realizing it was a colossal waste of time probably there to pad the quotvaluequot
fortunately the hotel saves the experienceso i mean to say the overall experience is as good as the first not as satisfying to play more of a novel than a rollercoaster ride
havent played sh ive heard its a rather short splatterfest which sounds like a sellout to me so heres hoping the series doesnt run out of energy and turn into another endless re or tomb raider cash treequotwarning lock and key puzzle rant
quotis anybodyi mean isnt everybody sick of stupid lock and key puzzles
even a brilliant series like sh cant imagine a better mechanic for story advancement than quotgo there get that put it in that lockquot
evil supernatural forces that have wiped out an entire town and can at will change the dimension in which i walk have to rely on a bleeping combination lock on a desk drawer to stop me
really
isnt it about time that we move on to some grander schemes besides solving some asinine japanglish riddle or having to walk ten miles to recover four parts of a rusty key to open a frail wooden door i could easily demolish with the sledgehammer in my inventoryi swear nothing ruins the mood of a good horroradventure game faster than an absurd and clearly arbitrary task
i cant be expected to buy into the terror of my predicament when the designer is telling me that even though my item bag clearly shows i have a welding torch an uzi a hydraulic jackhammer and the rare bonus item nuclearpowered flamethrower i cant turn the knob on that water faucet until i traipse all over town looking for the magical wrench of doom
how bout some new ideasi bought silent hill  a few weeks back and oh boy was i impressed
the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is even better
but the only aspect of the game which botherd me was the entire theme of the game
its physcologically terrifying as it just broadens your horizon of fear
well if youre in for a thrill that will scare the hell out of you go get it
im  and honestly speaking the game did send a shiver down my back
but you eventually loose the initial fearoverall i would give konami a big thumbs upbomberman online manages to breathe new life into an old formula
i love the new rules and hope they show up elsewhere in the bomberman series
the online games can be fun when theres no lag but it feels like this is just too little too late in the life of the dreamcast
nonetheless this is pretty good for one of the last dc games
what can i say
bomberman online is in fact the bomb
er da bombanyone who has kept track of the bomberman games since the beginning knows well that the gameplay has changed little over the years
perhaps its for the best however because theres no need to mess with classic gameplay unless it needs fixing
bomberman online features all of the multiplayer fun of the previous bomberman games plus a couple of new modes
for those unfamiliar with bomberman its a puzzlestrategy game with simple but addicting gameplay
the basic goal is to lay bombs to trap and destroy your opponents on a semid screen in a mazelike atmosphere
the most notable new features included in bomberman online are updated d graphics cellshaded cinemas online gameplay character customization and several new gameplay modes
while the single player mode may get boring after a while the real meat of bomberman online lies within the multiplayer battles
i strongly recommend it to those looking for a good multiplayer game for the dreamcast that anyone can get intothis game is a must have for your sega dreamcast onlineme and my brother was playing this game all day and night
it is a little bit hard to master
i was kicking butt online
i am the best online
this game is so coolthis is a very hard rpg gamein the beginning you get to choose  members to come along with you on your journey theres tons of different classes to choose from
its really hard but pretty funnotebuy this if your a rpg master who craves a challengei have this game and it is one of the better games i have for my gbc
it has some coarse language which prevents the five star rating
the action is non stop and the new mini games rock
there is one serious drawback however
you have to build up your skill levels and it takes a long time unlike pokemon
in between going to new towns you have to build your level up at least by three points
it takes forever with four members in your party
the music can also get to be aggreaviting as you will inevitably get lost and start a very long process of wandering around
anyway some good points
the different monsters are interesting and the graphics are extremely marvelous
if you dont have any patience and hate to wander around then do not get this game trust me you will dislike it
if your a dragon warrior fan then you should buy thisthis game is huge
just when you think youre done guess again
youre about half way
its really hard to keep up with the sheer magnitude of this game but after a while it can get a little tedious
the amount of leveling necessary as daunting especially at the end when theres nothing else to do
to tell the truth i never finished it i gave up out of boredom when i ran out of places to explore
i love the personality system and the ability to change classes and the save game system is ok  you really need the hint book for thisif you like the final fantasy series or dragon warrior then this is the game for you
the main characters name is wain and he can be assisted by up to eight other characters
you and your eight friends must stop the evil sinistrials from destroying the world
when a battle starts with an enemy you select three of your nine characters to do battle with the enemy
you may have to battle several openents at once
the graphics are good but not as good as dragon warrio  and  all in all if your looking for a challenge then you should pick this one upi think what many reviewers here are failing to see is the overall game design and atmosphere
for a start the graphics are quite beautiful and ground breaking for the time of its release
there are so many differnet locations from dungeons to lovely outdoor environments
the landscape rendering simply cannot be ignored
one area to note is an ice cavern level where the frozen floors reflect the surroundings
simply stunning
plus the variety of environments
it seems never ending
from celtic greenery to lava flows to ice to fantasy villages with fantastic machinery
the depth is incredible and the beauty quite breathtakingthe story also is quite deep and invloved which keeps the player interestedthe attack mode is  basic but does invlove a lot of dodging which works really well with many of the foes
also moving the camera view creates different strategic advantages when battling with various creaturesrune isnt a classic but its certainly a beautifully rendered and thoughtful little gem that can suck you in and keep you entertained for many nights
well worth a looki have never played this game on the computer but ive seen my best friend play it several times
my friend was really good at the game but told me that it was extremely hard to beat only later did i realize what he meant by this
at the last level there is a huge alien that is impossible to kill
i dont think i know anyone that can get past the last level
dont get me wrong i think that halflife has great graphics and awesome gameplay but i dont think anyone should get their hopes up about beating this gamegreat game decent port of it
i would suggest getting the pc version before getting this one
i only bought this one because it was a lot more convenient for me to have it on the consolei had heard good things about this game both for the pc and the ps
the controls are very intuitive except for controlling the monorail
the gameplay is very smooth and cleannow the good stuffthis game is very thorough and quite complex in game design
you get a pretty thorough training quotboardquot when you first put the game ineven on the easiest setting you still need to use your mind just as much as your weapons
just about everything around you can be used in one way or anotherthe enemies which range from your garden variety alien to some pretty weird monsters to and i might be giving the game away but you also have to defend yourself against the military which by the way are trying to shut you upthis is a very time consuming game so be prepared to spend some time with this gamelet me tell you a little secreti never finished half life on the pci know its sacrilegiousbut heyit was the fall of and my consoles were calling to me with stuff like xelda and metal gear solidnowrevisiting hl on the psim reminded of just how amazing this game isalthough its looking a little outdated in the graphics department even with the upgraded ps visuals hl can still hold its own against prettier newcomers like red factionthe saving grace here isnt how good the story is its rather cliche actuallybut rather how well it unfolds in the context of the gameyoure never at a loss for where to go nextsure the lecels are ultimately linear in designbut none of the areas feel contrived or unnaturalits also one of those games loaded with a ton of cool momentstrust meno amount of hyperbole on my part can prepare you for the shiver inducing stuff youll see in some of the later levelsbelieve ithls single player experience is unrivaledin multiplayerhowever hl is a disappointmentdecaythe two player co op mode is too shortand with its head to head and weapon modelsin two player head to head and weapon models in two player splitscreen only further hampers the deathmatch experiencedespite these heart breaking shortcomingsi can honestly say i had more fun playing hl on the ps this month than i ever did on my pc three years agoand yesi finished it this timefor years i have been hearing good things about this game
the story is kind of plausible the action is good the graphics and the puzzles are all challenging
i didnt like the fact that the monsters never adapted or changed tactics this made it easier to predict what they would do after a while
as for multiplayer there is nothing i can say to fault thathalflife is certainly a good fps title for the ps
its very reminiscent of voyager elite force or red faction
you play the game as gordon freeman a scientist in a secret research facility
something goes horribly wrong and a portal to an alien world is opened up and you find yourself battling a variety of alien monsters and even government soldiers sent to kill you and cover the whole thing up
in the end you will travel to the alien world for the final showdownoverall the game is a good game with decent graphics and sound
it has a quotsave at any pointquot feature which greatly enhances the playablity
the game plays basically as a continuous quotmoviequot with few cutscenes and fairly decent loading times
the control scheme is almost identical to one used in voyage elite force however you have to learn that your weapon does not necessariy aim where youre lookingi enjoyed the game and found it addicting however i began to tire of it in the final missions
this game is longer than most recent releases and even on the easy level i found it to be pretty difficult especially in the later stages
while most of the game involves fighting enemies a fair amount of your time is spent solving puzzles and in the end it became more about making tedious jumps rather than fighting aliens
after awhile jumping from point a to point b gets a little tiresomethis an enjoyable game worth the investment but be advised that it can get tiresome before you finish
the game is better than  stars but in my mind maybe not completely deserving of the  star rating primarily because of the quottediousquot factorkeep in mind im writing this review from the perspective of somebody that played the game in the last six months and not when it first came out
back then first person shooters fps werent all the deep in the story department and most of the time players just saw the storyline as something getting in the way of shooting anything that moves half life came onto the scene with radically new thinking on several frontsthe biggest one was intelligent enemies
there was more artificial intelligence put into your opponents so as they didnt just run up to you and attack like the monsters from doom and quake
they took cover laid suppressing fire tried sneaking around you and all other sorts of tactics
back in  you didnt much of that in a first person shooterthe second innovation is more what the fanboys say about the game rather than the truth and thats a storyline
indeed half life had a plot that you followed throughout the game that made shooting the bad have a little more depth however it wasnt all that
games like the system shock series and thief already gave you superior fps storylines
half life was just the popular oneand thats where we come to how this game stacks in the new millenium
i played it on pc back in  up to a point but never finished
i ended up finishing the game with the ps version
that plotline only takes you so far as much of the action in middle gets extremely tedious
if you dont mind just shooting and solving jump puzzles without much story to inspire then i guess thats not big deal
however these days more engaging plots on fps games is the normgameplay is pretty good for a console fps
the target lock system helps make up for the lack of the keyboardmouse configuration and the rest of the controls fit fine with the ps controller
the graphics are supposed to be enhanced but i couldnt see all that much of a difference from the original half life game set to high resolution on the characters
i believe the bitmaps for the walls skies and such is where the major graphic improvements were
either way the graphics are indeed datedin the end half life was a good game to play for the most part
only there were some very long stretches where i wished the game would just end already due to lack of any depth beyond getting past the level
the wow ending left me a bit underwhelmed after all those boring levels again youre talking to someone who played it recently i bet back in the day it was awesomewhats the verdict
if you can find it cheap by all means get the game and experience the highs and lows
i hear this game is being redone with the new hl engine so at that point i would say its up to you regarding a revisit when this happens
as for me i dont regret paying the  finding out what was good and bad about this gamewell they didnt screw it up
that may seem like a backhanded compliment but in the case of halflife which many of us consider the greatest computer game ever made this is high praise indeed
the classic tale of dr gordon freemans encounter with government duplicity a science experiment gone wrong and horrid visitors from another dimension are all here as they were
even people who have never touched a firstperson shooter know the story
in the middle of an experiment with a mysterious substance a portal to another dimension opens spilling into dr freemans world thousands of grotesque creatures
he must make it out of the black mesa facility to find help
early in the adventure he discovers that the us troops are already here but for some reason they are shooting at him
why would the government want to eliminate all witnesses to this strange alien invasion
that becomes the mystery of halflife still one of the great ones all these years later even with dated graphics poor voice acting and the inherent limitations of a gamepad
to say that halflife is a wellbalanced finely orchestrated single player experience is to slight a design that has never been equaled
it is the measure of a tightly scripted adventure
freeman starts in the bottom of black mesa and makes his way up through ruined halls and air ducts across radioactive pools and up enormous ventilation shafts
the genius in this machine is the pace
freeman is challenged relentlessly but never tediously by ceiling and floor caveins timed explosions loose electrical wires and of course a menagerie of creatures that all look variously like animated slabs of meat on feet
while much of the action takes place in an underground lab and some in surface locations half life maintains a remarkable feeling of variety
the assortment of enemy challenges and obstacle puzzles is so ingenious that you forget that you are spending most of your time among gray institutional walls and the wave after wave of problems somehow never feel forced
the designers make the usual assortment of fps conventions live by pulling freeman and us into the strange conspiracy at the heart of the game in a natural unobtrusive way
even the best of game designs can be killed by poor control and in the fps category it is especially hard to get a console controller to have the speed and accuracy of a desktop mouse which is the way god intended us to play shooters after all
the halflife control scheme is about the best we have seen on the ps or any console
front reverse and strafing commands fall to the left control stick while up down left and right pivots go to the right joystick
shoulder buttons handle jumping crouching and firing while the directional keys flip through the weapons inventory
it takes mere minutes to get used to the scheme in part because the action is so responsive to the controller
since aiming quickly is very tough with a joystick halflife for the ps institutes lockon targeting which lets you lock your aim and track on a moving enemy
it is a helpful feature in most cases but unless you hit the lockon button a second time to release the targeting your gun seems to be inexplicably locked just when you need it to blast that wet sock of an alien that just crept up behind you
halflife has a modest arsenal compared to most shooters rifles remotedetonated bombs grenade launchers etc
 which is fine since this is one shooter that stresses level design puzzles and plot rather than pyrotechnics
the same holds true for the graphics
it looks as if sierras developer gearbox lifted all of the fuzzy texture maps straight from the threeyearold original
the enemy and ally bodies have gotten an upgrade more detail in faces and bodies but this game is not pushing ps hardware by any means
hl was always strong on sound and the same is true in this port
the ambient tracks are menacing throughout and many upcoming situations are telegraphed by distance sound cues
while the masterful singleplayer mode is the feature attraction here the ps halflife adds a new coop mission called decay
this scenario follows the same timeline as the main storyline but you play part of it through two female characters who are elsewhere in the black mesa complex
a single player can switch back and forth between the characters in order to overcome various puzzles or two players can play in split screen mode
there is also a head to head mode in which two players run a split screen deathmatch for a designated time on select levels
while nice addons to the original halflife decay and headtohead modes are no reason to buy this port
but thats the good thing about this game
even if you did play it years ago it is worth a revisit in this competent translation to the pspersonally the n didnt impress me at all
i bought one very late in the life of the sys  about the time the first zelda came out
and to this day i only own a few games for the system and two of those are from the beloved extremeg series
the first installment boasted superfast racing and colorful smooth graphicsthe second game surprisingly was incredibly better with fast curving tracks and the implementation of an incredibly cool if not graphically impressive effect where if you go past the speed of sound in your speed bike the game goes silent after a sonic boom
all music and sound effects are cut off giving an incredibly cool effect
the only thing holding the series back was the fuzzy n graphics and terrible draw distanceso when the third came out without any hoopla or mass media advertising i noticed it came just as the other two did for me
all of a sudden it was there on the shelf
i immediatly picked it up and was dazzled from the minute i put the dvd in the drivebased around inredibly fast motorcyclelike racers with shields and armed with weapons you race around a track at blazing speeds up to and passing  mph
the shield and weapon effects are perfect excuses for acclaim to add tons of light and particle effects
when you hit a wall at  mph your shield glows a luminescant green in the portion that it hit slowing you down
and at first you will be hitting a lot of wallsthe trademark rollercoaster type tracks that go straight up twist and loop completely around are all included
tight turns and drops are everywhere and take a little getting used to after playing a game like gt
the draw distance is  incredible some loops you see miles away
it really has the effects of a fast rollercoaster ride through desert city and icy landscapes as well as one set entirely above and below water
acclaim really used the pss graphical power for this one and it showsthe powerup system is based on your placing in the races
instead of the pick up in the race method of the previous installments you have to earn money in races just as in gt
there are about  weapons and numerous upgrades to your basic engine
no refinement on your vehicle though it is just straightforward buying a faster engine
weapons range from a shield absorber to a vulcan cannon and all are quite impressivley visualizedthe music is perfect for this type of game
fast techno beats drive you as you hit the insane speeds of the game
with big name groups and each track having its own song they are varied enough for even the nontechno fanthis game is incredibly fast with the regular amount of cheat codes as with most acclaim games so there is no reason not to pick this one up
the tracks are worth the price alone and seem to whip you around like crazy
put anyone with a queezy stomach in front of the tv for this one and youll regret it
this game is definitely worth the priceif you trun all the lights off the in the room and stare at the screen hard while playing this game you are sure to get head pains really quick thanks to lots of flashing lights and totally awsome graphics and game play
is this a bad thing
i would not say so
the more races you win the higher levels up you go but its the outside level that makes it worth playing and fun in my opinion
i am not a fan of racing games to much but highly recommend you buy this or at least rent this
the reson this game gets  stars over  is because it is a little too shortlooking for a cycle game with lots of speed an action
then you need to check out this game
set in the distant future racing corporate sponsored futuristic cycles on insanely looped tracks against other cycle teams at blistering speeds
now add turbo boost a couple of rocket launchers mounted on your bike and a bigger badder engine to break the sound barrier which by the way is a nice touch in which everything just goes silent and now you have a death machine on two wheels to literally blow away the competition
you earn credits by placing in the race and then are able to upgrade your bike
controls take a little getting used to and you may have to reconfigure the buttons until you feel comfortable
graphics are awesome if you got the time to look at them as you are often to busy focusing on the track and the other bikers trying to blow them out the way
only complaint i had was there is no instant replay like in gran turismo  but other than that this game is right on
i would of liked a little more customization such as choosing colors of bikes perhaps maybe different models some suspension parts and engine upgrades as well as more weapon selection
even customize the driver oh well maybe next time
overall its a great game guaranteed to have you glued in front of the tv for hoursive played wipeout since ps
i havent tried wipeout fusion from ps yet but the reviews seemed to indicate that there has been little new so i decided to try this game instead especially now that it has hit the bargain bins in most storesxg is very very similar to wipeoutprosgood graphics compared to ps wipeout
no surprise here
frame rates are very high so driving thru the more advanced tracks is quite exhilirating once youve bought a new enginethe tracks are quite nice but i dont think you get much of a chance to enjoy the art work otherwise youll find yourself grinding against the side of the trackyou get to keep the weapons that you buy rather than use it for  a short period of timecontrols are responsive
should probably reconfig the turbo andgas controls right away to use the shoulder buttonsweapons are very very similar to wipeout
machine gun heat seeking missiles rockets shield enhancers mines consyou have to earn  to be able to get different weapons
wipeout lets you use them as you find themnot sure how choosing different bikers makes any difference
the manual does not say much and there is no obvious sense of it in the gameit took me quite a bit of effort to win race  the hint comes at the back of the manual where it says you have to feather the turbo
what does that mean
some bikertechnoterm
turns out it means repeatedly pumping it and releasing it to get more out of your turbo
that was the only way i could catch up with the computer controlled driversmusic in wipeout is much much betterits difficult to tell whether your weapons really helped
eg
deploy the mines and expect to hear some kind of explosion like in wipeout
not in xg
i think there is a sound but im not sure if its an impact explosionoverall it is a solid wipeout clone
if you always wanted a ps upgrade for your copy of wipeout but dont want to blow  bucks for wipeout fusion xg is pretty goodthe game made me bored fast
i suggest you rent it if you want to see how it isi got this game used through amazon for a very good price
i own fast food tycoon  and really enjoyed playing it so i assume this one would be even better and it was
just started playingpros i love the cartoonist graphicsvery challenging you cant just win the scenerios just like thatmore things to do in this one then the first fast food tycoonbiggest con still no real tutorial to go with the game
the game tutorial is bad
you have to figure out how to play the majority of the game on your owni would have given the game  if it wasnt for thatthis game is easy in general but sometimes there is a difficult boss battle
for me the fun part is the levels where you are just looking for the frogheaded thing and beating up the enimies in your way
the settings are sometimes dreary even though the game is mainly for younger gamers
that doesnt ruin the experience though
overall this is an exciting game that stays fun for a long timeim not a big fan of the wario series but i have played most of them
this one seemed different for some reason
it is different than mario because unstead of going in one direction u  go into a series of mazes to defeat enemies
unstead of jumping on the enemies u run in to them and pick them up
the graphics r ok for the gba but better then usuall
i like the feature of the motercycle because it is a fun and easy way to defeat enemies
compared to other wario games this one is fun and entertainingget your greed face on and let us muster gluttony for the precious riches within a mysterious pyramid
marios flipped persona arrives in his latest installment that is wario land   perusing through a newspaper and driven to the untouched riches of a recently discovered wonder the ever so dogged wario is oblivious to the demises of earlier attempts
up for the thrill and as moneyhungry as americas lovable politicians haha wario seeks out the pyramidas d sidescrollers go wario land  lives up to the portable gaming standards
using the incredible power of the gba a whole new height of action is consigned for players
squeezing high results their new disposal consists of warios truckload of expert moves like his mighty butt stomp the decisive bash the swift slide and much much more
with his new array of techniques the overtly fat wario earns a thumbsup for his trickier side of sidescrolling gaming
besides collecting items to complete the stages wario must now go deep into guarded enemy territory and keep his guard on his health
warios life now embodied as heart containers must be sustained by dodging attacks
if the containers drain clear the player is tossed back to the stages entrance and as a penalty loses all items found
some areas in the pyramid are to be advanced by the help of enemies
wario must proceed towards certain  enemies and imitate their special property
wario goes through a type of metamorphosis if successfully in contact with an enemy
there are also quite a few screenfilling bosses the players square off against
clever ways of attacking them must be utilized in order to defeat the overgrown menaces
if the player has any snag he can simply purchase powerups at a shop then vanquish the colossal brutes
lastly the three dandy minigames such as the home run derby match the face game and doge the whizzing objects add to enhance the replay value
difficultywise wario land  proves to be as painless as oldschooling gaming can getwario land  is a great d platform and shows with its bountiful stages
fast smooth and clean gameplay is generally found everywhere with the gaudy graphics
lets face it there is no other finer sidescrolling on the market right now other than the castlevania one and this is a portable title gone the extra milefor the most part ive so far greatly enjoyed this game
there are however some problems that do distract from the enjoyment
the camera takes too long to catch up to spidermans movements and makes it difficult to know where everything around you is
the save game feature is faulty
i save the game at every prompt to do so but when i start again it always starts me off a number of levels lower than where i saved
the biggest problem  the instadeath areas
there are at least two areas in the game where control is taken from the player in order to show spidey following some set route and control is not given back to the player until after spidey launches himself over a cliff edge resulting in unavoidable deathspiderman for the pc is sooooo cool no doubt
i think the graphics are awfully good and there are quite a few bosses to fightthere are overall about  levels and the toughest was probably the one where you need to swing from a falling cratei was excited when i found out carnage was in this game for im quite a big fan of his
it was freaky when doc ock and him fused togetherthere are lots of movies to choose from and many of them are fun to watch
a few drawbacks are on several levels you cant touch the groundand thats understandable because on the first movie carnage and doc ock unleash poison gas in that areabut i still think thats cheapin the short movies the only characters whos mouths move are carnage and venomsmaybe it was tough back then to animate the small mouths of the regular superheros
i cant really think of anything else except that human torch is ugly in this gamethe training levels are quite fun i like all of themi also enjoy looking at the characters in the gallery because you can hear them say a phrase after a while and zoom in on themsome of the comic books are impossible to get unless you put in the code leanest which gives you all the gallery stuff costumes and levelsthere are ten costumes to choose from most of which are not better than the normal costumethe whatif mode is great
there are lots of funny things they add in the movie like you meeting human torch and in the hostage level you get to see spidey boogie
the code for this is uatuseesa few more important ones are glandsadmntiumall i can say now is explore the whole game for secret stuff is everywhere
there is no blood on this gameps
on the first level when the copter chases you in what if mode swing to the giant blimp to see silver surfergreat translation of the classic capcom fighter
some small effects are missingswinging rails on the subway level transition seens and the normal nintendo censorshipno women thugs
capcom seems they tried to upgrade the music but should have kept the original scores
sound effects are perfect even better than the snes and up to par with the original arcade
graphics are awesome cody guy and haggar are done wellwhen i heard about the idea of game boy advance several years ago it was described as a portable snes
instantly the thought crossed my mind of playing some of my favorite snes games again or maybe have some of them redone and touched up a bit
thats exactly whats been done with final fight one which is a lot more true to the arcade game than it is the snes game from  everyone by now knows exactly what the game is and what it entails and not only has the game transitioned perfectly they added some hilariously goofy cutscenes before every boss battle complete with dialogue like i will beat your face in
which is met with a brisk shut up
the game as a whole feels a lot more capcomish with updated artwork graphics and menu screens but the gameplay is the same old final fightif youre a streets of rage or double dragon fan then final fight will nodoubt appeal to you
i only ever played it in the arcade once about  years ago but i was a cool game indeed
this gameboy advance version is identical to the arcade but with a few more touches added such as new cutscenes and animations and a couple of hidden levelssince i am such a wimp when it comes to games i did complete this on my fourth go on the easiest setting but i did notice a lot of similarities between this and sor in regards to the baddies level progression and powerups
thats not a bad thing but i only wish it lasted a little longer
still its a cool game and definitely worth gettinggraphics asound bgameplay blasting appeal bi played this game about  years ago on snes but it didnt have guy as a character choice you had to purchase either final fight guy for the snes or final fight cd for the sega cd  the game remains faithful or close to the arcade version names of the bad guys are the names used in the arcade and not the snes version
the car smashing bonus gane is included and there was another but it escapes me at the minute
i have the game boy player for the cube and it looks good on a quot screen
i think if you have not played final fight one you should the price is under  and it is fun i also think the graphics even edge out the old snes version
a recommended buypointless to review a game that hasnt been available in years but oh well
i shouldnt have sold my copyive come to believe that final fight one is probably the definitive version of final fightmighty final fight nestoo hard doesnt really play that well and obviously the visuals and music arent up to parfinal fight arcadealso emulated on playstation portableplaystation  etc
the second worst music behind the nes version and lacks the nice interface and extras of the other versionsfinal fight segacdone of the best versions
enhanced in quite a few ways from the arcade version and nothings been cutfinal fightfinal fight guy snesprobably my third favorite version
a few things are altered and cut do to memory constraints including the most dull level in the game and one of the three characters
music is enhanced substantially over the arcade version and overall i like this better than the arcadefinal fight one gbanow we get to why i think this one may even be better than the segacd release at least as a single player game
visually its very close to the other versions
better in some ways though apparently a few light effects were cut that were in the snes game
the music isnt quite as good as the snes release but still vastly superior to the arcade onebeyond being portable the other big improvement is this version has the most single player content
there are a decent number of unlockables that you get basically just for playing through the game
most significantly cody and guy from the street fighter alpha incarnations are fully playable characters with completely different art and somewhat different fighting stylesessentially giving this release  fully playable characterslady sia can battle seemingly impossible odds with ease
no task is too difficult for her
unfortunately shes just a video game characterafter searching for a used copy of super valis  for what seemed like an eternity i finally found one 
then i heard about this game
i decided i wasnt going to make the same mistake twice and it wasnt rentable in my location so i just bought the dawm game
not a mistake on my part but definitely more difficult than i had hoped for
the game is fun yes but excruciatingly hardin the first few levels youll find yourself should you play this game adjusting to constant enemy attacks
the hard parts come in the later levels with constant falling and unreliable bubbles that pop and drop you just a little too soonthe controls are flawless unless youre a nitpicker the graphics are nice and the animation is almost like water  thats a good thing
the only real problem with the game is that it has a difficulty level comparable to the contra gamesi saw lady sia  listed in nintendo power magazine
if there really is going to be a sequel i hope they make the necessary improvementsas for the story you as lady sia are upset that a gang of misfits called tsoas are ruining your towns and your council refuses to do anything about it
as you progress youll recieve some weapon upgrades turn into monsters and face some of your counciloh
in case youre wondering these are the basic controlsa jumpb attack press repeatedly for combostyle slashingselect  i dont rememberstart  pausestartup  look up climb ladders activate switchesdown  duck look down climb down laddersleft  run to the left walk while holding lright  run to the right walk while holding ll  sneak hold while pressing left or rightr  slash use in conjunction with b for special combosgood platformer for those who like a throwback
detailed artwork looks so much better on a bigger screen such as a ds
lots of animations for the characters and great levels to explorewhen i started playing this i was somewhat disappointed by its mindless sidescrolling hackandslash action
it seemed a lot like donkey kong country with a somewhat more attractive protagonist if you want to argue this point go right on ahead
however for some reason i cant seem to stop playing
i am at a loss to explain it but it must be good then rightthe first thing youll probably notice about lady sia is that its pretty tough
you arent able to take a whole lot of damage and theres plenty of things to deal it out to you
ive never been able to pass a level without dying at least once yes i even bought it on the first one and oftentimes the only way to get past all the obstacles is to simply memorize where they are and what to dothere are however quite a few ways you can go about defeating your enemies
you can use magic special moves or just charge in and hack them all up
sometimes you get to ride a big white bird that can pick up guys and drop them into the ubiquitous abyss that has been a mainstay of these games since super mario bros came outwhen it comes down to it lady sia has decent graphics and an odd charm and is worth your investment of time and effort
the plot might be a bit simple but it doesnt seem to be a big issue even for an rpg fan like myself
this game isnt an experiment in subtlety or revolutionary gameplay
its a classic arcade sidescroller with good old hackandslash actionits a short game and the voice acting is not that great other than that i was surprised by the gameplay
you can crawl jump and shimmy like a tomb raider game with a go anywhere camera
i call it a resident evil clone with good controls
monsters are convincing and battles challengingyou have one gun which you attach addonssurprised this one didnt get much attention
i expected a mediocre game but its actually quite goodextermination in my opinion is better than the resident evil series
yes hard to believe i can understand but after playing code veronica this is much better no questionthe game takes place in antarctica as you are equipped with knives and several other weapons to save the world
this game has exceptional cinema clips with great voiceovers along with an exceptionally story
the only downside is how he falls in love with a woman he finds on his journey
real mushy and it takes away from the seriousness of the gamethe graphics are expectionally welldesigned and the play control is simply amazing i couldnt ask for more from a complex role playing game like this
after i beat it i wont give away the ending i replayed the game just to reexperience the intense gameplay with the cinematic scenes with the message behind it allbottom line extermination is the best rpg out there for the ps
buy it there is no doubt in my mind that it wasnt worth the money spentthis game is pretty good when you get into it a ways but in the end you are gonna end up going back to the good old resident evil games
the setting isnt as spooky as an abandoned police station and the little mutant bug things arent as freaky as zombies but this games is a nice change from re
the graphics are good as is the sound and the story is a little more convincing than the res or silent hill
i have beaten this game and the ending is only soso and by the way there is no replay value
the only plus is that you can start a new game with a bunch of weapons and meds thats it
and all of the cutscenes are mediocre with the characters lips still moving long after they are done talking and the annoying subtitles are like  sentences behindits ah good ole fashion ideal with ah twist
bug exterminatore goes marine sent to a facility to do just that exterminate some bugs big ugly mutated bugs with a condatious virrus
i found the map of the facility to be small the camera angles helpful but limited when needed the storyline to be thrown togather like somekind of pilot for tv and the graphics were excellent
its very fun surpriseing like a cartier vascalary attack and is out there like instatuted crazy people
i loved it  stars baybahthe rest of these reviews pretty much sum up the gaming experience of extermination ie if you enjoy resident evil you will most definitely get into this game
the storyline carries along nicely the graphics and sound are good the weapons and battles are cool and the overall atmosphere is creepy with a menacing ambience that sets a great tone
the only quibbles i have is the voice acting think the first resident evil
yes its that painful and extremely laughable
i mean if a buddy of yours died would you nonchalantly say damn
why is it so hard to get good voice acting in a video game
and the camera angles
there are a few points in the game that are so blindingly annoying because of the awkward positions that it is nigh on impossible to point yourself in the right direction when you climb into the crashed plane and attempt to leap off of some crates hanging in the air youll know what i mean
with these few points aside this is a game worthy of playing
dont buy it though just rent it as its only a good  hours long and the replay value doesnt add up to much collect all  dogtags and you get to play through with more ammo weapons and health which doesnt mean much since the monsters take more damage the second time throughthis game is decent especially considering it was not really a mainstream ps game
the controls are not the greatest especially some of the camera angles
with that being said however the gameplay was nice and the storyline not too shabby either
this game grew on me
when i first started playing it my interest was rather low but over time i grew to enjoy it
the monsters were pretty smart and the environments pretty creepy
too bad this wasnt created for the pc as i now do not play console games anymoreoverall  goodthis is one of the best extreme sports games i have played although it was way to easy to beat
its just like thps its lots of fun but not enough missions and levels
if there is ever a rd one make more levels please it would be more fun
i would have given  stars but there isnt enough levelsthe first dave mirra game which was released on the playstation  and the dreamcast set itself apart from the other bmx games on the market by implementing a completely unique trick system
every other skatebike out there has basically cloned the incredible tony hawks pro skater control and trick system and all have fallen short of the mark that thps set
the first dave mirra game although it did not come anywhere near matching thps  or  in quality and depth still sold well because of its new unique systemnow dave mirra freestyle bmx  is being released on sonys playstation   nintendos gamecube and microsofts xbox
it has advanced beyond its prequel in some ways but has stayed pretty much the same in others
almost inevitably it must compete with neversofts tony hawks pro skater dave mirra  boasts new characters more bikes vastly larger levels and of course greatly improved graphics
the trick system has been expanded with many new tricks and variations availablegraphically dave mirra  is not bad to look at but not really anything special either especially in comparison to thps
the d models are adequate and offer a good many lines to ride one and the textures are uniformly good
still the game is not nearly as graphically beautiful as some of the other firstgeneration games that are available on the new systemssound is good but again nothing special
the soundtrack is alright and even has its high points but its really a matter of personal taste
the usual grind noises thumps whacks and grunts of pain are satisfactory and vary enough to sound goodthe levels are large and often very creative but not as welldesigned as those in thps
they are fun to ride and contain the usual secrets huge jumps and multipurpose obstaclesthe game is much harder than its predecessor but still easier than thps
it should take a good while for most gamers to beat the game with every character and unlock all the secret videos riders and modes
there are rumors of secret levels too but i have yet to unlock any of themalthough most of the game seems pretty mediocre its still one of my favorite bikeskatetype games ever
why
well it all comes down to the trick systemdave mirra s trick system requires much more dexterity than that of the thps series does and it allows for literally thousands of trick variations
the thps system uses two buttons to do flip tricks and grab tricks and these can be chained together with grinds and manuals to produce long trick sequences
dave mirra also uses two buttons but it on the other hand focuses on making customized tricks by means of combining different simple tricks in midair
it is possible to pull a trick or two at the same time as doing another trick
for example one command might make the rider do a double backflip another might make him take one or both hands off the bars another might make him take one or both beet off the pedals and yet another might make him do a spin
so if the player hits a jump initiates a double backflip and then initiates a barspin and a no hande and no footer command the rider could pull a  double backflip barspin suicide
with a wide variety of simple tricks and doubletap variations of these tricks dave mirra  offers an enormously deep and engrossing trick system that will keep a lot of us gamers busy for hours on end
and once you get used to the system you can start pulling all kinds of amazing combinations
and of course common stock tricks like superman seatgrabs and double nacnacs become quite easy to pullsimilar to thpss manuals mirra  riders can tie their tricks together with heelies and nose wheelies and flatlanders can even pull endoes and stoppies if they know what theyre doing
a wide range of grinds and plants are available tooin the end this game will not impress anyone with its mediocre graphics and just decent level designs
what will keep people coming back to this game is its brilliant trick system and the enormous versatility
i still havent gotten tired of it
if you like bike games and especially if you bike in real life like i do  you will find this to be the best and most enjoyable bike game available
its easy to start playing even for beginners but offers enough depth to keep even hardcore gamers coming back for morefirst off id like to point out to you that i am a pro bmxer who takes the sport seriously meaning i would then take this game seriously aswell
when dave mirra freestyle bmx came out for playstation i can remember all the hot gossip it got and how great it was for its time and dare i say better then the tony hawks series however with this game released today it just doesnt seem to be as good for its time as much as the original wasgraphically dave mirra  is a vast improvement from the original although unfortunately it bugs me trying not to concerntrate on how poor the graphics are after playing games like tony hawks  aside from that i find the game has to much respawning and graphic glitches which can really drive you nutsespecially when playing proquest mode
another disadvantage i must tell you is that in my opinion the graphics seem a little too cartoony for me especially in the outdoor areas otherwise the the faces on the riders are very realistic aswell as the bikes
for ps graphicssoundwise dave mirra  is below average for a extreme sports game i mean there is just not enough sound effects not even an improvement from the original just the same old bird chipping metallic sounds when grinding grunts when crashing
the creators really could have spent more time on the sound
musically the game is a mixed bag with poppunk hiphop rock and modern metal and the terrible thing is theres only ten songs
ten songs
and only three i like although after a while youll find yourself turning off the music
the game play for this game is good with some of the best and largest levels in extreme sport games that i have seen
the levels are very detailed well planned and fun to ride on
the controls are somewhat very responsive and easy to get use to as for the tricks they look fairly realistic when performed and not only that but their heeps of possible tricks to perfrom with new sik trick system which allows you to modify a trick like lets say you could do a backflipflairturndownbarspin in one combo making the game feature a shocking number of over  tricks to be done in this gamewonder how acclaim could fit that many tricks onto a controller
the proquest mode is very good aswell has challenges from ameuteur to insane the missions also are terrific compared to the tony hawk series
the multiplayer mode for this game is actually very underated i guess since the multiplayer mode where you verse a friendfamily is not split screen but really to tell you the truth i slightly prefer it it non split screen and where you just take turns however thats just an opinion
their are also allsorts of multiplayer challengesover ten including best height longest grind and the ground breaking wipe out mode which lets you challenge a friendfamily at trying to do the most painful crash in  seconds and what makes it even more cooler is that you can bail and one of the best features about this game is that its bails and crashes are without a doubt the most realistic ive ever seen in an extreme sports game
the meat of this game is easily its replay value which amazes me at how a game with very average graphics can have an extreme replay value
with the park editor which lets you create just about anything and not only that but unlike the hawk series this games park editor i find is very simple to use
the free ride option will also have you coming back to the ps just to bum around at classic parks like woodward and because of how realisticly funny the bails and crashes are you will most certainly not want to throw away this game
just before i finish this review i might just add a few minor complaints  doing backflips in this game is ridiculous you can pull em by jumpig from the ground i mean cmon be a bit more realistic  i find when performing tailwhips that the frame seems to move a little to slow and could be faster like normally if id jump off a box i can tailwhip and just landand im not even a champion whereas riders in the game are whereas in the game if i tried i would only be  through finnishing the whip
 sometimes and i mean sometimes the camera gets focussed on a large object if i pass by it rather then focusing on the rider itself
 i may be a little picky here but as one reviewer stated where are those tricks like fufanus
and also the tomahawk trick
otherwise this is a game i recomend everyone to atleast playi picked this up yesterday and after about  hours of play time id have to say  so far so good
yes the camera is a little off at times
stays behind a wall so you cant see what youre doing sometimes  i guess there is still some slowdown as well although i dont really notice it all that much
one other issue is the respawning after a crash sometimes it puts you in a weird spot and collision detectionclipping problems occur but never for too longnow on to the good  i really enjoyed this game on the dreamcast first version and this one has all the good points from it plus quite a few more
the first thing youll note is the size of the levelshuge
you will get lost but youll have fun doing it
manualsnose manuals have been improved as have wallrides
lots o fun  as one review put it nicely the quotmagnetic railsquot from the first version are much more realistic when you grind stuff too
graphics are pretty damned  impressive especially the riders themselves
the levels now include gaps which is a welcome addition and theres a new quotbeginnerquot controlconfig that mimics the mighty quothawkquot style hold down x to pedalrelease to jump which is much betterless confusing if youve spent as many hours as i have playing that mythic gameone disappointment to me though is that there still doensnt seem to be a real quotabubakaquot spelling
or a quotfoofanooquot  of my favorite tricks dave amp company do especially out of a half pipe onto a back deck rail
you can do a tailtap and try and land faky or try and bring it back around but its just not quite there especially if you have to cover some distance from the  rail back into the pipe
maybe i just need more practice
if anyone knows how to do these in this game please clue me ini havent played a complete version of hoffman yet so i cant say for sure but to me it seems like hoffman is too identical to hawk more skate like where as mirra has more of the bike physicsfeel
the soundtrack is unusual to say the least but i like it
kudos to them for not having to use the newesthippest stuff out there re quotparanoidquot by ozzy and quotshe sells sanctuaryquot by the cult  i wish i could drop in some queens of the stone age but with only  or so songs i always end up turning off the music anyway gets old too quick
i barely touched the level editor but it looks promising indeed
so to wind things up here  basically if you like the first one youll love this one and if you havent tried it at all give it a rent  or  on ps or dcthey all seem pretty good and see if its your cup of teathis was a very fun game back in the day
trying to play it now reminds me how difficult the game mechanics were
its very hard to be great at this game but that doesnt keep it from being fun
much better than the first game in this series
and a great soundtrack sure helpsfor those who didnt play dave mirra  i played it on the dreamcast it was a decent game with a good trick engine but ultimately nasty framerate problems and lack of direction within the levels hampered it
the trick engine was very promising though and its good to see that dave mirra  has definitely kept the good aspects of that engine and improved upon it significantly
the single biggest difference appears to be changing manualsnose wheelies to be more like those in tony hawk  that is to say theyre actually useful now 
whereas in dmfbmx  manuals were useful to rack up points at the end of a trick they werent very useful for linking tricks or actually moving about the arenaas for other improvements the framerate problems that troubled the dreamcast release have been alleviated but have not gone away
theyre most apparent when you shatter breakable glass in the game the awnings on the commercial district level come to mind
a note to zaxis if eyecandy cripples the framerate of your game please turn it offfor people not familiar with the dave mirra series be forewarned that the trick engine particularly getting air on halfpipes is very subtle and will take a while to get the hang of
getting a feel for how to get big air on halfpipes is crucial to the game and not immediately obvious
while rentals are encouraged remember that you wont necessarily pick it up immediatelynaturally since this edition of mirra is on the ps you have the general benefit that everything is bigger prettier etc as has been mentioned the levels are enormous and its quite possible to get lost on them
i would dare say that the quotdestroy  foos scattered around the levelquot challenges are a bad idea at this point
luckily in some levels the woodward camp and devils peak there are moderately helpful signs to tell you where you are and where other areas are in relationone aspect which was good to see is the park editor
where the console tony hawk  park editor was simplistic and restrictive though a very good first effort the dave mirra  park editor looks to be very sensible and versatile
i havent played too much with it but they made some very good decisions and it looks like youll be able to have parks with real flow to them which is very encouragingthis game does have some problems however
the item collection idea gets awfully tedious in such large levels as does the mirra system of having different classes of challenges per level progressing from rookie through amateur pro and hardcore up to insane
you cant see and therefore complete higherlevel challenges until youve finished all of the challenges at a given level which is annoying when youve thrown off s and high fastplants in early stages only to find out that you need to do it again because the game didnt see fit to credit you with ones done earlierin general dave mirra  could stand to benefit from being more like tony hawk  in terms of game structure and level design
mirra has a phenomenal trick engine which is very thoughtful and unique in a genre filled with games where their only good aspects are stolen from tony hawk
if only that engine could be mated to the polish and allaround fun of tony hawk wed have a real contender here
however the mirra levels are simultaneously too expansive and too cluttered
its far too easy to get hung up on edges and just dump and there are real problems with areas where the level does not behave logically with whats displayed
in particular in woodward camp the first level theres a platform that you can clearly see under but cant ride under
why
this makes no sense its different from other platforms in the same level and just serves as an annoyance
in one of the more difficult challenges in the game also on woodward youre asked to grind a long series of rails starting with a short rail that you need to jump off of at an extreme angle and distance to get to the second one theres a cheap way to get around using the first rail but i consider it a bug more than anything
this is already a difficult challenge but its made more aggravating by the fact that the grindable surface of the rail ends about  feet before where it looks like it should
its these kind of visual inconsistencies which only serve to aggravate the playerall griping aside however i highly recommend dave mirra  theres annoying problems with it but games of this genre really come down to the engine and mirra has that in spades
not only is it fun to play but its a remarkably sensible attempt to truly model freestyle bmx trick formation
most importantly its a good trick engine whose good qualities arent ripped off from tony hawk
the world needs more games with this kind of creativity and i recommend the game not only on the grounds that its fun which it is mostly but that this kind of game manufacturing needs to be encouragedwhile the original dave mirra bmx for the ps and dreamcast wasnt much to look at acclaim and zaxis managed to make some big improvements here and there to make this sequel stand out on its own for the most part
graphicly speaking the game is superb except for a few glitches here and there
controls are tight fans of tony hawk and mat hoffman will feel right at home for the most part and a surprisingly good soundtrack featuring ozzy with the late randy rhodes doing quotparanoidquot along with rage against the machine and the cult keeps the game moving along nicely
but there are a few flaws worth noting as well
collision detection should have been improved upon greatly youll run into a wall and fall off your bike unknowingly sometimes and now and then the screen will freeze up for a second or two and then keep going which can detract from the gameplay
all in all there is nothing wrong with dave mirra bmx  but those who have discovered the recently released superb mat hoffman pro bmx  will be disappointed when they play thisoverall this is a great game but it has its problems
the camera say you go around a pole the camera can get caught on the pole which can get in the way of gameplay
landing can be a bit goofy some times you fall  but you know you landed right
 the camera can make you sick
 the sound track is good but limited and repetitive   grinding is a bit too easy
on the plus side the load times are short  the levels are huge
think of it this way remember the school level in thps well the levels in dmp bmx are twice as big
 it plays like an rpg some hate this but i like it you try to gain quotrespectquot  the park maker is fast and simple  the graphics are very good
the game on a scale of  to    high  low i would give it an  sound  graphics  fun  gamplay  it is very easy to get into the game so if you are a beginer youll find it easy to get intoa little less than a year ago acclaim was the first to stake out bmx territory on the playstation with dave mirra freestyle bmx
nine months later a quotremixedquot version of the game was released containing new levels and a smoothedout trick system
now acclaim and zaxis have claimed the first playstation  bmx game with dave mirra freestyle bmx  the jump to nextgen hardware has been good to the game in many respects but the control problems that have haunted the last two games are still present and a few new ones have cropped up to boot
not straying from the script established in the first game the focus lies in the career mode where you take a pro bmx rider through the games eight levels completing a variety of level challenges along the way
the basic goals remain essentially unchanged with the standard highscore longgrind and bigair challenges making a return
beating tony hawk  to the punch each level is populated with other pro bmx riders who will lay down the levels more difficult challenges most of which consist of executing tricks on specific items in the level
this character interaction helps to further immerse you in the level but the challenges existed in the last two iterations of dave mirra and the other riders essentially serve as window dressing here
youll also find a variety of motorized vehicles rolling around the levels each of them a grinding opportunity
the twoplayer modes have been expanded on greatly now offering  different game types such as a highscore challenge a horse variant and a wipeout mode where players try to pull off the nastiest most painful bail possible
the game also includes a hefty level editor comparable to the one found in tony hawks pro skater  youre given a choice of several level themes a large open space and a boatload of objects with which to design your level
using the dual shock  to design levels can be a bit clunky but that wont stop those determined to design their dream bmx track
one of the biggest improvements that the playstation  hardware has afforded dave mirra is larger level size
the woodward camp level for example essentially takes four levels from the original game and rolls them up into one
other than the size of the levels however the level design is pretty much business as usual with status quo courses set in old industrial train stations and busy urban centers though the swamp and arizona desert levels do provide a welcome change of pace
balanced control has always been a bit of a trial for dave mirra games of past and unfortunately it has remained that way
dave mirra  employs the beefedup control scheme from maximum remix which uses the x button for jumps the triangle for grinds the circle button for bike and body tricks and the square button for trick modifiers
the trick modifier is a suitable wild card as it exponentially increases the games trick catalog but it also lets you perform physically impossible tricks such as the physicsdefying  nohanded superman
the game still suffers from magnetic grind rails and easily landed tricks and the collision detection and environment clipping is way off making it possible to put yourself inside otherwise inaccessible buildings or else right through metal rails with a wellplaced bail
suffice it to say the physics in general lack polish and considering its the area that has been begging for improvement through the life of the series its disappointing to see the same flaws rear their ugly heads yet again
there are significantly more good things to say about the presentation in dave mirra  though it is still hampered with a few noteworthy problems
as stated earlier the levels are big and any popup you might see is so minute that it has little impact on the game
the character models have been improved adding a greater sense of diversity to the collection of riders
the riders are better animated as well making for smoother trick transitions
bland fuzzy textures are now but a memory as is texture warping
on the bad side the game still suffers from the occasional fit of slowdown
the camera has a tendency to get stuck on corners and low overpasses leaving you to watch your rider go off into the distance until the camera catches up
the soundtrack is pretty much occupied by the types of musical acts youd expect in an actionsports game current poppunk darlings sum  contribute a track as do methods of mayhem rage against the machine sublime and fenix tx
while hardly a genreshattering collection of artists the soundtrack is serviceable and serves as decent background noise
dave mirra freestyle bmx  does not suffer from any single huge crippling flaw rather a handful of smaller problems plague the game and keep it from achieving bmx greatness
if youre looking for some bmx action you could certainly do worse but acclaim and zaxis could certainly do betterok lets bring down the emotions a bit  some of the reviewers are getting just a little bit too passionate about what is after all a game
on the other hand i am not as passionate about this game perhaps because the experience leaves one wanting more  well passion
as with many sequels to popular series star wars episode i anybody
 there is always the danger that the producer just failed to understand just what was so popular about the experience
in a few words the key to mgs was solid snake the cool standoffish nature of the character the fact that he appeared psychologically complex and possibly repressed due to a deep cold and complex past
you in effect became solid snake and the immersive nature of the first game along with the fast pace and interesting plot line created the single most popular game on the original playstation and its even better on the dreamcast using bleem
this second game tries and fails to outdo the first one by eliminating the single most important aspect of the game the character the player becomes
without spoiling it very few people would argue that they became the lead character
this twist was a grave mistake
that removes one star and i would remove another  star if the rating system would allow it
unfortunate a slightly flawed great game that is worth the  to  stars that i would give itlet me first stress that the gameplay in this sequel is phenominal
however like the first mgs the poor story sappy character relationships repetitive dialogue and seemingly endless cutscenes all but ruin an otherwise terrific game
this is definitely a game that will be better the second time you play it so that you can bypass the melodramatic exchanges and drawn out codec calls without fear of missing vital information necessary to complete mission objectives
all in all a good time but i grew so tired of waiting for one series of cutscenes then codec calls and more cutscenes to end that i simply shut off the ps
it can get frustrating especially if youre ready to save and quit or simply have to go to the bathroom
i would have given it five stars if more than half of my time playing the game was actually playingthere are two problems i have with this game
first theres too much talking
you practically spend more time watching movies than you do actually playing
and most of the talk is pretty boring its usually some character blabbing on about philosophy
second i like it better when my video games dont admit that they are video games
i wont reveal the exact plot but theres a point in the second chapter where a character actually tells you quotyouve been playing this game too muchquotother than that its a fantastic gameokayfirst of all i am not a hardcore fan of any game
so i dont expect anything to follow up in a sequel
to be more specific i have never played a mgs before mgs
but i love the game and i have no problem with the main character raiden and not snake
i mean come on if a game uses the same person it gets repetitiveanyways i bought this game because of all the hype and i must say wow
this game continues to amaze me
the graphics are great
the gameplay is like what a shootingstrategy should be and not just another kill all
however there is one thing i dont like is having to constantly skip dialogue and movies after i beat the game
the first time i played i was glued to everything but now i just have to skip it all
all i have to say is if you like rd person shooterstrategy play this game before you label it
i mean sure you dont get to play snake but a game isnt just about the character
thats why its such a great game
its setting it self up for a new era of mgss with raiden and its doing it the right way
instead of just erasing snake theyre doing it gradually
so itll fit in with the gamethis game dispite its seriously upgraded graphics is not much better than the original
its practically the same story told again on the psraiden was not the best choice for a lead character
solid snake was a far more useful leadthere were far to many cutscenes
i wanted more play less watchingcontrols were good allowing for accurate fire ease of movement and looking aroundall in all a good game though not greatok you know the downside to this game you only get to be snake for roughly  of the game then youre this final fantasylooking raiden dude
that stinks and i hope konami doesnt try pulling that one again in mgs in  let us be snake all the way through  or at least give us the option to choose whether to be snake or raiden instead of forcing us
hopefully they arent trying to wean us off of snake and choose raiden as the hero of the series from now on
that being said this game is good otherwise
the cinematics are great and snake is more fluidlooking and awesome than ever
yes there are extended periods of watching rather than playing when you finish the snake mission and begin the raiden one you can plan on about  minutes of watching as one storyline closes and another sets up  and beginning the raiden mission means youll be talking on the codec every minute  no lie
 for the first  minutes of your game but thats ok because you play a game like this to enjoy the story
if you just want to kill things then youll need to look elsewhere
most of the snake mission involves stealth you dont even get a real gun until halfway through it so its more like being sneaky than anything else
and yes it is possible to finish this game without killing a single soul or kill em all if thats how you feel about it
there is a series of long cinematic sequences as you get to the last two boss fights in the game one  minutes long and its impossible to save until you get to a part where you can play so plan on watching a lot as the game draws to a close
there are several plot twists thrown in at the end that really come from nowhere and dont make much sense and the conversations sometimes go off into strange areas that have nothing to do with the gameplay at all but are meant to develop the characters
no way to skip any of that without missing something good so just grab a pepsi and get comfortable
after defeating the last boss the ending cinematic really isnt that satisfying  other than the fact that it possibly gives a glimpse into what mgs is going to be about
all in all its a great game and a worthy sequel
id give it  stars but you play metal gear to be snake and that doesnt happen enough in this onethe goodthis game is spectacular
the graphics are extremly fluid and lifelike
everything you can think of is interactive you can hold up guards drag bodies shoot pipes step on cokroches the list just goes on and on
also when you shoot someone in certain part of the body it causes a reaction other that just bleeding and dying
for example shoot someone in the arm they cant use thier arm shoot someone in the leg they limp
its just amazing at how much work went into this game
the enemy ai is quite intelligent because they can notice shadows hear and see foot steps and hear you drop empty maginzes
it took konomi over  years to perfect this game and i have to say that i am extremly happy with the final resultthe badok now whenever a game is created there are always flaws in the storyline gameplay ect
the bad part about the game is totally outweighted by the positive side but lets mention the bad anyway
ok well the worst part about the game is that there are a lot of movies
this may not hurt some people but others who want constant action may be afected
about every  minutes you will experience a short movie but sometimes they tend to be quite long and tedious
another annoying feature of the game is the fact that it is somewhat short with only about  hours of pure gameplay
however the game has alot of replay value and you can earn cheats such as infinite ammo and play on extremly hard difficulty
and one final note is the storyline
the storyline is extremly hard to understand even if you are an extremly smart  year old like me
it would literally take the intelligence of a college graduate to figure out the entire storyoverall  this is a very nice game and i would highy recomend it to anyoneif you like action games you should shell out the relative pocket change to buy this title
warning it is a game that revolves around stealth just in case that turns you offmy synopsis playing as both solid snake and also a rookie named raiden you infiltrate a terrorist operation to prevent the use of metal gear to cause mass destruction
most of the game is spent using raiden who is caught up in layer upon layer of intrigue as he fulfills his mission
the plot twists and turns as you discover who truly are your friends and who are your enemiesgraphics the environments you play in are very simple metallic military type settings
this isnt pushing the ps to new levels or anything but its really not necessary considering the subject
the characters are rendered beautifully though
i was extremely impressed with how lifelike and expressive the characters could be
the animation is strong and fluidplay control  why no 
let me preface this by saying that overall the play control on this game is superior to most games in responsiveness environmental manipulation variety of movement and controller layout
i mean this is a game where you can be looking though a first person view to aim and if you need to you can stand on tippy toes to see over something
if while crossing a catwalk an enemy is about to spot you you can quickly flip over the side and cling to the edge while they pass by
you can kneel crawl swim dodge grapple strike and handover hand
evasive controls are easily activated and directed a major flaw in many gameswhat the game may lack in environmental detail it makes up for in personality details
your radio allows you to maintain communication with multiple characters during play and depending on an action you are carrying out at that moment their dialogue will be appropriate
the programmers have hidden lots of potential dialogue within the game depending on what you manage to do in a given situation adding to the replay valuethe environment is destructible within limits
walls and most furniture  cannot be destroyed making explosive weapons largely useless noisy andwelluseless
however doors can be opened or broken off
crates and barrels can be destroyed seagulls can be shot at and insects can even be toyed with tooid give the play control a  but there were some flaws for example when trying to press up against a wall you attempt to peer around a corner  the camera may switch to a disorienting angle just before you reach the corner
now the direction you were pressing on the controller to set up your lookaround gets completely interrupted by the change and you find yourself trying to figure out which way to press
the camera is fixed so sometimes during abrupt camera changes you may mess up and find yourself completely exposed by the disorientation which can quickly end your game
in order to survive you really dont want to be seensound the music is forgettable which is good because i hate when music takes your attention away from the game
ultimately in a game like this you dont want to notice the music
it does enhance the mood when you are in a tight situation or youve been spottedthe voiceover work is good but not fantastic
anything that comes off as cheesy is more an issue of scripting though the voice actors did fineplot  some players of this game will say what
at my rating but hear me out
though the story has intriguing moments and revelations that cause you to want to see what happens next there are far too many interruptions by dialogue that just doesnt belong
for example when you are in the middle of breaking peoples necks your ing girlfriend may radio in and want to reminisce about the day you first met
this is just plain painful to endure
you may sit through  minute discussions with a character about how they feel they went wrong with a former pupil while outside explosives could be going off any minute
in fact theres way too much emoting in this game considering youre supposed to be a trained killer silently executing vicious terrorists
am i right or am i wrong
at least you can skip just about every conversation
the problem is that you may miss a key plot point if you do that
also it really gets old when a character says something to you and then your characters response is either what
or i will now repeat exactly what you just said in the form of a question
its like hes some half deaf moron
hopefully in the sequels to this game the writing will be tighterultimately i consider this game a mustbuy
but considering how popular it is you probably already know that
heck you probably already have it and are just reading this review because youre at work and are just as bored as i am
well if not buy the game
its really awesomethis game is no doubt hyped to a pulp
everyones expectations for this were so high that little details slipped out
like the fact that the plot is not very good
it has too many bizzare twists and a stupid main character who is absolutely no excuse for the solid snake we have all come to know and love
on the other hand this game has great graphics
never before has a game like this looked so real
the gameplay offers an outstanding vaiety and never gets boring
the blood and cursing give it a realistic and mature effect so it feels like your not playing one of those nintendo games designed for bascially yearolds
the cutscenes are amazing and i had never seen anything that even comes close to this masterpiece
the amount of detail will completely blow you away and left in complete awe you shall
environments are rich detailed and help accent the gameplay very nicely
i wish that this game was longer as it is only about  hours
nonetheless this is a strong game thats good but not everything that it has hyped up to bethe game is very well detailed in story and visual effects
the controls are fluid and the gameplay is great
the major drawback is the lack of playing time
at many times in the game you feel as if youre watching a movie more than playing a game
youll find yourself running from  cut scene to the next and they can last from  minutes to  minutes
if you want more playing time save the money you would have spent on this one and buy mgs substance
save movies but alot more to do in the game
better bang for your buckthe gameplay is pretty much identical to metal gear solid on ps
the graphics are topnotch and it has the classic mgs feel
awesome music compositon a wonderfully written story
what brings this great game down to a  instead of a  is that there is a lot more watching than playing and the plant chapter can actually get tedious
a lot of the rooms and sections look exactly the samei recommend this game to any metal gear and metal gear solid fangoshits really painful to give the game  stars actually i would give  and  starswhich i thought i was gonna fall in love with like i have with the first metal gear solid i just finished the whole game and left with this feeling of incomplete sorta the best thing i loved about the first mgs is that there was this very strong sense of being fulfilled satisfied completed however i couldnt feel as same as i have felt with the mgs when i finished the whole thingok may be thats so because of high expectation perhaps too much expectation i had for the game
what you have to understand here is that this game itself is such a great game i wouldnt hegitate to give a perfect scoreonly if i havent played the first metal gear solid
this second masterpiece is a very solid game
you can definitely witness the power of ps with the much enhanced graphic and dolby digital  soundi really liked the msg  but liked the first one better where it shows the sign here and there that the team of hideo kojima have put so much effort into this very game
the enemy soldiers have gotten tougher which gives more challenge and because of clear graphic using first person mode to use your weapon becomes natural
what i missed from this second installment is that i felt it wouldve been better if there were more boss fighting like the first mgsthere were also lot of complaints about putting too much cutscene for a game and i do admit that i got the impression that it was little bit overdone but what you have to realize is that all the cutscene is there to bring this games real quality up to the expected level meaning they are there for the reasoni thought there were interuptions here and there where i felt bit annoying since the first game implemented that where it tells you to push action button to get on the ladder and etc
it was funny in the first game but thought it wasnt that necessary to do the same thing because im sure almost everyone has played the first one
it did interrupt the flow of game where the flow of story line is one of its strongest asset of this game to add little to that complaint is that everytime you are trying to save your game raidens girl friend rosemary talks about her feeling and love talk
it does add to the game but time to time it took away the urgency and the seriousness of the situation like when you are on the way to save president but that becomes justifiable toward the end but not  thoughthe game does end in a way where it leaves this open ending doesnt give this completeness
at least the first game gave a great ending where you can definitely feel the accomplishment of the mission
somehow the second game leaves this opening too great that i didnt expect that was the ending of the game whereas the first one gave more endings after endings like when you thought you finally finished the game then theres more fighting you have to do in the first gamehowever what really consoled my shattered expectation is that since it leaves this great opening for the ending i was sure that there would be metal gear solid mgs  was like star war episode  which will work like a good solid ground to build next episode
i sorta wished that if they could work on the flow of game with more controlled cutscene and could bring the climax more dramatically i wouldnt hegitate to give a perfect score for this gamei still have this impression that they have overblown the twists of the story to top the first game but cant also deny the hope that the third installment will be surpass the first two metal gear solid because of its giving a headache twistto wrap it up the very experience ive felt from the first game was there in the metal gear solid  but not as strong as the first one
regardless of everything i said about this game its a masterpiece you dont wanna miss it
the awesome intro itself is worth buying this game
ps i had so much expectation from solidus and i was disappointed to see him
i was sort of expecting this man who doesnt talk much really cool but solidus looked and acted very cocky and someone whos not really worthy of code name solidus  i was expecting more of solid snake level but doesnt even come close
dangwhere is snakethis game is an interactive movie  furthermore the graphics are too dark  which is used to hide flaws in rendering  i enjoyed this game but consider other games firstthe sound effects are awesome the gameplay is fun the graphics are not bad  i really like this game well i got this game for xmas and im not to familiar with the original but i thought this was a pretty good gamei do know however in the original the main charactor is solid snakebut in this solid snake is only played for about  of the gamein the rest of the time you play as a foxhound solger fresh out of vr traininghis name is raidento fully understand this game you should probly buy the first  and beat that be purchasing thisthe enemy bosses are kind ofwellunrealisticfor examplea fat guy on inline skates droping c explosives evrery where a bisexual vampire who cant be shot a woman who can not die and carrys around some sort of quotlightning gunquot or some guy who has tentacals coming out of his sides like that  dude from the spiderman comic booksyou learn more about these enemys as you progressoverallif you think you can handle such a crazy cast of charactors this is a fun kinda short game to owni only gave this game  stars because i gave mg solid  stars and i do not think this beats the original
all in all it is fun and amazing
great story even funny to the point of silliness at times
a fitting sequel for such an amazing series
you play this game in  parts
the st part you continue to play solid snake but with some added bonus features such as the sleep gunas i call it and the camera
you enter a boat and have to find out some info
once the boat is done we do not see snake for awhile but instead follow a character called raiden
this is such a great game series that i bought ps solely for this game
worth your cashas many others have written this game is dominated by cinema scenes and long rambling dialogue on the codec
i have to admit it gets annoying and frustrating to sit around watching cinematic scenes and listening to codec conversations instead of playing
the other thing that i hated about this game is that you do get only a short chance to play with snake the main character of the original metal gear
you spend most of the time controlling the whining raiden who i couldnt stand
why couldnt we play the whole game with snake
the storyline didnt quite cut it either
i dont know if it was ruined by translation or what but it lost me towards the ending with all its preachiness and philosophical talk and im a lit majorthe reason i gave this four stars was because when youre actually playing the game its great
this is the first metal gear ive played since the original for the nintendo nes and i was amazed by the graphics and gameplay
i loved sneaking up behind guards and taking them out with a quick choke or a tranquilizer and it was amazing to watch the character hang over railings and work their way across ledges
maybe i liked this so much because i never played the metal gear solid for ps but i enjoyed the actual playing time immenselylies a very interesting critique of video games as a storytelling medium
hideo kojima has a lot of ideas perhaps too many but it is refreshing to see a game take gaming seriouslysome issues to think about while playing this game
are you the character on the screen
what is your actual relationship
does a virtual world have to only form a bubble around your senses or can it cater to itself
also can you get that girlfriend to shut upso yes
sometimes a little hokey with the dialogue but overall particularly conceptually a very important video game to see play and think aboutmetal gear solid  sons of liberty is a cool game the graphics have been completely enhanced
there are more moves to sneek up on your unsuspecting victims
the only problem is the amount and horrible length of the cutscenes
some of them are actually fun and the really long ones are the lectures of certain things
there is one desgusting part of the game and that would be the part where this character has to run around naked
speaking about raiden you play him throught most and the rest of the game
despiet these flaws its a good gamean excellent addition to the metal gear canon  i guess
at times a bit on the talky side i could have used a bit more shooty less talky  but it seems fun so far
some humor helps bring it above its predecessor and the voice acting is much improved
the ai is a bit slow and dopey  running around in circles like ai characters tend to do  but the added stuff  peeking around corners and sticking people up a la quotfreezequot is fun but not as much fun as i expected  espescially from all of the hypethe most unfortunate thing about this game is raiden
raiden is your typical inexperienced over commpassionate teenage hero
hes very much like luke skywalker who receives a lightsaber and suddenly possesses a power which enables him to destroy every vestige of evil in the universe
raiden like many other hollywood heros is unsuprisingly a pathetic joke
im sure im not the only one whos tired of game developers producing young inexperienced moronic heros guided by the belief that gamers will be able to relate to them better
if that was true then why is mgs s hero  year old solid snake the most revered hero in computer game history
now i understand that snake couldnt have been used for this game due to the storyline but still i would have preferred someone who was less submissive who could be perceived as strong and who wasnt a girl which radien arguably is
since raiden is essentially a pathetic joke its hard to believe that hes the hero they make him out to bemany people hated the mgs storyline but i think the story could be percieved as fascinating by some or absurdly bizarre by the rest
i suppose the nearest thing it could be equated to are those conspiracy theories that you find on the web like massive underground alien bases lsd experiments mind control experiments etc if youre a fan of that stuff then youll probably find the storyline interestingother than raiden and the storyline the game is pretty good
the gamplay the innovations the graphics unexampled still and the ai cant be faulted its just that some might feel that raiden and the storyline have pulled this game down into the s
the games lengh is a problem too
but thats about it
all in all the game is good but its nowhere near as good as mgs let me start off by saying i have never played any of the metal gear series before this
that really didnt matter though as facts from previous metal gear games did not need to be known to understand what was going on
the gameplay is simply this you are given a mission that you must complete using practically any means necessary
your weapons range from a sword to rocket launchers and guided missles
the story makes sense but may become confusing near the end as you are not sure what is really happening to your character and what isnt
although you dont spend much of the game playing as solid snake he helps you complete your mission and gives you advice
the action is exxciting and sometimes hilariously funny as you guide your character through the mission
as for the graphics they arent cutting edge but they look good and arent very blocky polygonal
the music changes depending on your location and alert status
half the time you wont even realize there is music or background sounds because you will be too tied up in the action but the music goes well with the situations it is played
the game isnt overly short but it isnt excedingly long either
i finish teh game in roughly  hours
the only fault i found to bring its rating down was the ending was more cinemas than it was gameplay and the plot was stretched too far
metal gear fans and anyone who likes action games should definately get metal gear solid  sons of libertythis game is great
first things first though do not look up anything about the plot before playing this game just be prepared for anythinggraphics   keeping in mind that the game was released in  the game looks astoundingcontrols   it plays just like the first game except a few things were fixed
howeverthe game is old and even though i really like the control system its a bit clunkygameplay  actual gameplay is awesome
its the bosses that arent very good
the bosses either seem to be trying to imitate mgs the jet or are just plain stupid fatmanplot  this is where the game falls short a bit
the plot is good but its extremely unfocused confusing and rediculously outthere
towards the end stuff makes less and less sense especially a certain part which i wont spoil but its after the really really long cutscenebonus snake has one of the coolest mullets ive ever seenwhat happend to solid snake being the main character
the gameplay is great but the story and other main character stink
thry should have used solid snake more than raidenim a big fan of the original metal gear solid for playstation
i loved the action and the whole concept of sneakong around and the story was top notch above the rest of the games on the playstation
so i didnt hesitate to pick this game up but as soon as i finished which was at least  hours later after all the lenghthy cg sequences i just realized i played metal gear with no snake
whats up with that
and the ending was confusing i wont say any thing here  not that i can explain it in this short span anyway
well not enough snake to make the rating a  if they cut down the dialogue in the codec sequences it wouldve been alright and easier to bear
i still reccomend it but bear in mind youll be watching the game more than actually playingmetal gear solid  was probebly the most wanted game for the ps besides ffx
everyone had high expectations for the game and for the most part it meets them
for people new to the metal gear games this game requires that you sneak around
this isnt a fps type game where you just blast everything you see
but its challenging and funthe graphics are probebly the best feature of the game
the characters have eyes unlike the first mgs game where the just had dark lines
almost everything is destructable
you can shoot pipes little bottles etc
there are also nice little effects like shoe prints breath and the rain effects are pretty realistic
this game has a first person view where you can shoot guns but cant move and during the rain you see little rain drops get in your viewthe control is basically the same as mgs with a few new moves
you can now hang from the rails and you can look around corners and do a quick jump out shoot at a guard and quickly get back around the corner
you can either kill a guard or knock them out with a tranquilizer gun
you can then hide the body in a locker or whatever you wantnow for the story
the story plays out threw movies and long conversations through a codec where you just see two faces talking
for anyone who has played metal gear solid youll know the story was very good
for this game its intersting but it has a few disappointing surprisessome parts of the story dont seem to make sense and can get very confusing at times
also there are a lot of movies
you can literally walk  steps and then a  minute movie will play
the beggining took forever
you cant even pause the movies like in ffx
not a good thing when you need to gofor my final say i think mgs is a pretty good game but it just has to many long movies making this a game where you do more watching than playingmetal gear solid  is awesomewell sort of
it would have been more fun if you were solid snake for the bulk of the game
you start on a tanker as snake then flow two years into the future and become raiden
snake is still around but you cant play as him
to me that is the worst decision konami made
with respect to mgs it has some of the plot elements offinal fantasy x play both games and youll find out why dads are such bad creatures arent they
the graphics and controls are excellent storyline is full of twists even rivals ffx in that department who in the world tells you the truth right
replay value is high but not to find anything just to try harder settings
the game is a must for now more snake in mgsmetal gear  is a remarkable game that entangles you in its story from the very beginning
this latest installment seems to utilize the capabilities of ps to the maximum as the graphics alone leave one in awethe environment is responsive to the characters actions and the game overall leaves an impression of a very well polished work of art complete with a beautifully done story
the guards have multiple quothit pointsquot which means hitting them in the arm hand chest or head yields different results
glass is breakable lockers can be opened and climbed into etcive followed this game pretty much from  and having played metal gear solid ps one im glad that kojima didnt rehash a classic again for this one those that are familiar with metal gear  solid snake for the msx will probably agree that the ps one game was basically a d rewrite of the lattermy only quotbeefquot with this game is the amount of cutscenes
i dont think id be exaggerating if i said that the cutscenes are basically  of this game
which if youve beaten it once already is quite annoying given that you cant disable them either
two smaller issues i have with the game are a cliche character comebacks ninja and b the obvious poorly made reference to titanic and quotjack and rosequot dicaprio is one of my least liked actors hence my dislike for titanicthe games replay value isnt too far up the chart mainly because i cant find any cheats for it and sorry but collecting tags isnt incentive enough for me
also you cant just prevent cutscenes from being displayed you have to wait until they start and then stop themoverall however the game is worthy of ownership
its a great game at the very least you owe it to yourself to rent it  youll do yourself a favor if you actually go out and buy itafter playing metal gear solid for the psx i had very high hopes for the sequel
it took me a while to get the ps but when i finally got the system one of the first games i bought was metal gear solid  sons of liberty
i popped the game in my ps and was blown away by the graphics
while games like final fantasy x and kingdom hearts may be more visually pleasing with vibrant colors metal gear solid  goes for realism
the characters solid snake or one of the enemy soldiers look and move realistically
there is no difference between the graphics in a cut scene as compared to when you are controlling snake yourself
everything looks beautiful even if it is in a dark gloomy atmosphere
the controls in this game are tight and even better than metal gear solid psx
if the first game had the controls of this one it might have been the best game ever as it stands it is one of the best games i have ever playedas fun as the metal gear games are to play everything is driven by the story and this is what makes the games so interesting to play finding out what happens next
while the story of the first metal gear solid was fairly complex and far reaching everything was presented in such a plausible way that i didnt really question the possibility what was going on
i just accepted it as the story
in this sequel some things just werent very plausible even for the mgs world
i wont spoil the story if there is anybody reading this review that has not yet played the gameon other thing is notable about this game
the game is broken up into two chapters
the first chapter is called the tanker chapter and you play as solid snake the hero of the previous three metal gear games
the second chapter takes up most of the game play and is the shell chapter
in this second chapter you play as raiden a rookie to the foxhound unit the unit which solid snake was a rookie in the very first metal gear for the nes
raiden is experience in vr training but has never actually been on a mission
at first i was very unhappy with this change from using solid snake as a long time player of the series i have come to associate snake with metal gear as a playable character to this kid
as the game went on it made more sense in the story to be using raiden
i would still have preferred to use solid snake but the inclusion of raiden is not as offensive as it once wasoverall this was an excellent game
i have to knock the game down one star because of the convoluted story and a little bit because of raiden
without question metal gear solid  is near the top of the class for the great games of the playstation   it is a lot of fun worth playing and worth owningthe most import thing to know about this game is its heavy reliance on story and movie
i find linear plot and strong cinematic scenes to be an enjoyable genre of gaming but many people wont agree with that and be frustrated by the seemingly endless cut scenes that constantly interrupt game play
id say you spend about half of the game in noninteractive scenes and thats being conservativethat being said ill talk briefly about the plot without any spoilers
the plot is weird outlandish and never stops twisting
you cant know whats going on because it changes quite often in ways you couldnt imagine
along with it are large numbers of references to previous metal gear plots so its worth playing through metal gear solid  or at least being briefed on it because the shadow moses incident comes up time and time again
in fact youll notice a lot of subtle allusions to shadow moses if you watch for themthe game play is amazing
its strange to have an action game where the best strategy is not to get into any fights
still since youre an infiltration agent this style of game play is very realistic
when youre seen by an enemy their first reaction is going to be to call for backup and jam your radar likely making you flee for hiding spot until the commotion dies down
still crouching crawling sliding along walls and hiding under cardboard boxes are a lot of fun
and for the times when there are enemies you cant sneak around you can always shoot them with a silenced gun and drag their bodies out of sightfor those who just want action theyll likely be sated by the various boss fights
taking out harrier jets with the rocket launcher or even large forces of soldiers with a sword is action packedthe environment is incredibly interactive
you can shoot mirrors and glass and watch them break
shooting pipes can send out jets of steam that can hurt you or guards
blasting something full of powder like flour bags or fire extinguishers releases a substance that can reveal ir beams but will make you cough
youll even find adult material that can distract guards if properly placedreplay value in such a linear story is somewhat low
still upping the difficult level and trying to collect dog tags from the various opponents can give the game some added life
it took me about  hours to beat including story scenes which makes it a prime candidate for a good weekend rentali liked it alot picture is great game is fun the wepons are cool its just most of the game your this longe haired wirdo that looks like a total wuss he talks like a girl to your only snake for the first  minutes of the game and he only gets  wepons a dart gun and a pistalthis game was released in  and was a complete success in america and is still one
this takes place two years after shadow moses on a ship in new york right now the legendary solid snake is working with hal hammerich aka otacon and they both are known as the anti metal gear orginization
in this one there is a new metal gearmetal gear ray a some time of amphibion metal gear
well anyway there are two chapters in this game the tanker chapter and the plant chapter
the only thing i dont like about this game is the fact that when you play the plant chapter you have to play with a new person named raiden real named jack and he is an amateur compared to solid snake but that was my only complaint to this game
everything else was great and if you like more stuff then get substance which is a renewed version of sons of liberty but unless you are low on cash then get the original version which is now on the greatest hits list
i hope you get this wonderful gamemetal gear solid  is the highly anticipated sequel to the playstation classic metal gear solid that was released in  mgs  retains all of the same action of the other metal gear games and adds stunning graphics improved enemy ai and an even more interactive environment
this is probably the best looking game on playstation  to date and the involved but easy to learn gameplay make even multiple play throughs enjoyable
in fact fooling around is whole new game in itself
try setting c in a guards path and trigger it as he walks by or try shooting out the lights or hiding in a box to screw with his head
its freedom like this that makes mgs  so great
so the gameplay and graphics live up the hype but what about the story
unfortunately this is where mgs  falls short
in the beginning it starts out great but torward the end things just getvery weird youll see what i mean
its seems as if the creators went a little overboard on trying to make the storyline dramatic and complex
this is the only factor which keep it from deserving a perfect  stars in my opinion
even so metal gear solid  is a superb game and is well worth buying if you have a playstation metal gear solid was one of the greatest most influencial games on the playstation game console
now recently hideo kojima has done it again
this time on the ps
a next gen system
but does mgs live up to the hype
oh yeah
you start out as our hero solid snake on a hijaked tanker off the coast of new york city invetigating the new metal gear type metal gear ray
this is the most fun game segment i have ever played
then we get to the somewhat disappointing plant chapter
its not that the plant is horrible its just isnt as good as the very small tanker chapter
in the plant you play as this big crybaby named raiden who has problems with his girlfriend rose
their whole soap opera thing gets old after rose and raidens first argument
then theres thwhole stupid part where rose is jealous because raiden thinks emma is cute
  other then that this is a must have game for any metal gear fanprobably my alltime favorite video game franchise with the exception of the madden football games
the original metal gear was one of the first games i owned for the old nintendo nes
and even though the kids today would go back and look at that game and laugh it was still so far ahead of its time with its concept and plot twiststhis game is the equivalant of watching a great hollywood action movie
cutscenes do get a little long on here even more so than on mgs  but it does tell a great story with tons of twists
something about the metal gear games remind me of the show  or should i say  reminds me of metal gear
i have to think the creators of  had to be metal gear fans since the show deals with some of the same issues such as treason corrupt government officials conspiracies and never knowing when someone you thought was an ally is selling you out
and you must admit snake is a bada just like jack bauerthe only reason im knocking a star off of this rating is for the same reason that so many other reviewers have
having to play  of the games as raiden
huh
come on
not being able to play this game as snake and instead playing with the wussy punk raiden would be like  replacing jack bauer with that guy from high school musical
i just dont understand why they did this
i must admit when i started playing this game and realized this it was like finding out there was no santa claus
once i got over the initial shock and disappointment though the game is still great and hard to put downgreat graphics story with many puzzles
one of the best tactical game 
the storyline of this game is good but i prefer the first metal gear solids adventure
hideo kojima has created wonderful game that become one of the famous installments for playstation
i know this game has a lot of fans i am not between them and most of the gamers choice is the metal gear solid
in other way dialogues and videos take too much time that should become boring
some boss fights are not realistic
for example when raiden meets the whole army of metal gears and he is capable to defeat many of them
that was not my expectation for sure
this game caused enough interest to play next release called metal gear solid  snake eatermetal gear solid is sure a pure gem but it has a few flawslets get started shall wenow first of all
what the hell is raiden doing here
alot of people had a problem with raiden being in it

the raiden dude was a big mistake i love being snake mgs didnt need another herobut any complaints are small stacked against how good this game is overall
buy it a ps without this game or gt is not completemetal gear solid  is one of the best follow ups ive ever seen since gta  but why the named riden takin ova the picture
the game was diffrent and a quite bit worse without snakegameplaywell u can enter first person mode stickpeople up put em anywhere u want u can fire in intrusion mode and have a radar in hard and extreeme and the good ol things u could do in mgs
alot more to dographicsif u saw tha comercial then do i need  say anything about the graphics they kick sum major bootiesoundgreat sound effects and exellen music from movies likr the rock and very good voice acting except from the  year oldwell he looks like hes a  teenager and he dont look like hes a guy that kills people and he dont look a second over valuebeating the game was easy because it was short then secrets was the next thing i wanted to do so i got all the dog tags
theres much more to do in this game than mgs that will last for a whileoverallthis game has to be in every psers library of games and if it aint and u call urself a true gammer why dont u think that over
this game is excellent except it doesnt have the feel of mgs and i know jes why cuz the mr riden hogged all the action from the man we all crave for when were playin mg solid snake
it just dont feel like a game without snake
if hideo had snake in the whole time insted of jes  min this game wouldave been alot mo alive alive fo reel
i recomend this game to anyone with a ps periodmy sister and i rented metal gear solid  one night for ps
when we launched the game i was stunned
the graphics are really realistic and the gameplay is fun in the beginning
i loved the first metal gear solid with all its great gameplay graphics and an exciting storyline but metal gear solid  doesnt measure up to the first one
it has kind of a choppy storyline it isnt bad but it isnt too good either
the gameplay is fun in the beginning until you switch to this other secondary main character
this was a complete disapointment because i hate switching to other main charactersoh well 
anyway the gameplay doesnt even come close to the first metal gear solid but i liked the unique stealth strategies you have to use in this game
there are also new features in metal gear solid  but i was kind of disapointed in the gameplay
what really saved me from giving this game three or two stars was the graphics
the graphics are ultrarealistic and the sound is nice and sharp
the voice acting is also very well done
if you liked the first metal gear solid you may or may not like this one because it is pretty different
the gameplay isnt that well but the new features graphics and voice acting are good in this game
i still like the first one the best though
metal gear solid not too bad nor too goodthis game is a lot of fun and it satisfies on many levels
what i mainly take issue with when it comes to this is that the storyline kind of falls apart towards the end
other than that this is everything its supposed to be a tactical espionage shooterdespite the long talking scene in the end of the tanker chapter and the idiotic ending mgs  is a excellent game from konami
it doesnt waste a lot of time by having more then one disk unlike mgs
a very good thing that isthe bosses are interesting but for the people who started playing the metal gear saga by the second one dont buy this game
you need to understand what is happening
the graphics are excellent and the sound is wonderfulmy problem of the game is you spend more time playing as radien but not snakei love the series and i love the gameplay of sons of liberty when you are actually playing but
there is way too much sitting around in this game
at a couple of points you sit around for  minutes at a time
the clips are good and informative but cmon
this is a game not the movie of the weekthis game is great
just like the last
but someone needs to let konami know that its a video game not an interactive movie
but i deffinately recommend this game to anyone who likes msg for the ps
just skip all the looong movies
hate to do it but i cant stand to sit there forever waiting
enjoymgs is a good game with great graphics and play control
the longwinded cut scenes are annoying and it does seem sometimes like youre just watching a movie
if you liked the other metal gear titles you will probably enjoy this one too
remember it is not a rambo type game you will spend more time sneaking around and searching for things rather than shooting thousands of soldierswhile armada iis story mode is very forgettable compared to the original the gameplay and visuals have been given a massive overhaul
the only real fault in the gameplay is that the borg are op as hell which makes a lot of sense
this game is as challenging as you need it to be and while the story mode is very weak that shouldnt deter star trek fans or rts fans from making a purchase or  if you want to set up a lan party which is where the game is most enjoyable
this game is about as complex as starcraft and for trekers especially its a must have for hours of strategic funi bought this after playing the demo a while back
after several weeks of gameplay i have come to find things that i really  like and i really hatelikebetter graphics than original armadatrue dgood sound effectslets you play most famous ship classesdecent cross section of trek speciesgood pacingdislikeai both enemy and your own units is a dumb as a brick
i dont know how many times ive heard quotship has entered a dangerous nebula
ship has entered a dangerous nebulaquot even though the nice safe path is clearly nearbyspecies  is too weak
in the tv show they sent the borg packing
come game time they can be thumped by a couple of lowrange federation ships
what givesrescource management is a bit spottyall in all this is a decent rts game definiately meant for the hardcore trekkie or maybe a rts fanthis game is slowly getting better as far as crashing goes
but it still sadly looks a lot like the first game they have added new ships and new abilities along with  new races but it is really a lot like before
if you loved armada like i did this game is worth buying
here are the pros and conspros new racesfewer bugsnew ships and special functionsbetter interfacenew maps and single player levelshas a tutorial level setconsseems to use more memory hard drive space processor time and zaps more from a graphics cardstill has some bugs on older systemshas only  major single player level setsseems to have a weaker storyoverall i would say this is one youll have to decide for yourselfi wasnt terribly impressed with armada  the resource collection system was uncreative the races quotmirroredquot each other way too much im still trying to find a significant difference between the defiants and interceptors the ship classes differed from each other very little except in size only  ships could be selected at a time space only had two dimensions and worst of all the mouse control was so sluggish that playing the game was almost painful
it gave off a very halfbaked auraarmada ii although it still suffers a few of these problems fixes far more
the resource collection system is the most interesting and original ive ever seen
there are more ship classes than before and they are more distinct both within each race and from one race to another
you can select twice as many ships at a time than before
mouse control although still slow is much better than before
and the battlefields are now in true d
however you still cant go over or under an asteroid belt or nebula nor can you build one building over another making it almost useless
its still quite neat if you use it right though because you can now send ships flying under a wall of defensive turrets or hide them at the top of the map
heck just watching them bob up and down on the map is cool
theres even some stuff that didnt need to be improved but was anyway
there are  playable races instead of  and even though there are fewer campaigns each campaign is much longer for  more missions overall
borg assimilators are now based on an actual ship from the show instead of being quotjust another boxquot like in armada  a ships structural integrity is now a separate issue from its crew and the ship damage and repair systems have been generally enhanced
the officer limit is a little annoying but it is adjustable and helps to balance the game a little
you can even tell your ships to go to warp speed now even though it more closely resembles high impulsethe most important thing though is how much fun a game is to play
armada  has seriously upped that factor with its fusion cubes and tactical fusion cubes that are capable of singlehandedly wiping out an enemy fleet and base
there are more special abilities and therefore more possibilities for clever and dastardly tricksthis game is how armada  should have been
dont let anyone tell you otherwisethis sequel to one of the more popular of the star trek pc games has a a whole new look and feel for the gameplay experience
imagine this game as star trek armada  bred with homeworld cataclysm
this game has much more to offer than its predecessor
this game has an entirely new d view similar to that of homeworld and the same overhead view found in star trek armada  the graphics have been retouched and more beautifully sculpted in the computer and the action sequences can now be viewed in a wide variety of views and a new zooming feature for the feel of detail in every ship in your armada
activision has added new ship classes as well to  different races federation klingon borg cardassian romulan and species  although you can only play all  in multiplayer mode and only  of the races can be played in single player mode newer strategic abilities have been added to this game
much like homeworld your ships can now be grouped into d formations such as  of your ships into x formation or wall formation
ships can now run on both impulse and warp speeds during gameplay
the ship classes for each race has numbered over  each
an example of the classes include federation ships venture defiant akira sabre steamrunner intrepid iwojima aegian colony cargo galaxy sovereign nebula etc
ships each have the existing special weapons of the first game and also new additions of special weapons
there are several new starbases such as ship upgrade facilities where the player can upgrade the ship shields life support engines sensors and weapons
planets can be colonized by colony ships and also trade centers can be built so that you could mine and trade dilithium latinum metal from planets and crew
the storyline is well written and takes place just shortly before voyager returns home to earth from the delta quadrant
overall star trek armada  is a much improved game that deserves player attention
this is a game for all star trek fans and a definite must buygameplay  graphics  sound  value  i like this game more than the first and is great if you like the command amp conquer games
the main differnce between the two armadas are the graphics and the ship selection and it has a quotquick missionquot optioni generally do long reviews but im taking the short road here
i picked this game up at a local store because they were selling it reasonable and never expected to actually enjoy it
coming straight from recent hits final fantasy x metal gear solid  sons of liberty and the new gc version of resident evil i was sure that this wasnt for me
besides soul reaver  left me bewildered even after the first left me amazed
so here comes this shadow man econd coming game never heard of the first one i was never a n fan and i popped it in
as i said coming off the previous hits i found the controls to be difficult and strange at first then i found them quite appealing and different
as a game it stands up great lots of puzzles creepy atmosphere and a gothic soundtrack
the graphics fall short simply because of the recent hits again but gameplay isnt lacking
finding the bird skulls is tedious though swimming through the swamp with lifelike alligators chasing you is unnerving
better to use the asassin rifle first and clear them out
people may complain that its too tedious and boring all i can say is this if you want to play and not think pull out the old blood  doom series or at worst stun yourself with the graphics of soul reaver  without a semblence of game
shadow man doesnt step up to halflife but its well worth the time and effort
one last point i enjoyed devil may cry an outstanding but short game
shadow man is a little more intricateif youre a shadow man follower like myself then you know you gotta get this game
however it doesnt live up to shadow man senior
let me explain
shadow man is a black guy from the city down on his luck after failing his college courses and squandering his resources with gambling and booze
when a line of shaman and a voodoo priestess get mixed up in the line mike is transformed into the shadowman lord of darkside or hell basically
but with great power comes great missions and shadowman is required to collect dark souls before a certain demon named legion does and create demon humanoids bent on turning the world into a fiery carcass carved out of hell
this game has tons of blood and gore and very creepy sound effects such as clawing people and pigs squeeling or the detestable screwing and surgery done to an infant somewhere in the back
you also have to acquire different powers that enable you to do things such as swim in lava climb walls of wire and coal climb blood waterfalls and more
this game is one of the best games ever developed
control appears a little stiff at least on the n version which also has terrible graphics for this game
i have heard the playstation version is way worse as well
so do the smart thing and grab it on sega dreamcast
its obvious a lot of care was put into this platform voodoo cursing biblical testing serial killer chasing game
so the first one was a banger
what about shadowman 
there are some cool new elements to it
i like the fact that shadow man is bigger and the special effects added to him when he enters deadside is cool
what is a little irritating are things like not being able to hack through wood with a machete fighting three or more enemies all at once using unimpressive and unimpressive control scheme for fighting as a human and dark region areas
even brightening the screen didnt do much for me on this game because youll still cant see anything
even if you do manage to reach checkpoints and discover a few new levels and secrets all in all its super difficult to advance
i cannot advance in this game yet not even with the walkthrough
by the way if you find a walkthrough youre lucky like me because it was almost impossible
so if you love shadowman and want to rise to the challenge go ahead buy it
but this game is waaay too hard before it actually gets startedill be honest i havent messed around too much with the whole quotactionhorrorquot genre that seems to be turning into a major hit for developers as of late but shadowman  is pretty darn coolthe game has a spooky feel that pervades the entire playing experience
how fitting that the backdrop in the quotliving worldquot are the swamps and plantations of louisiana
oh and the sound is on point as wellgood jobone of my biggest pet peeves as far as games are concerned are the controls
shadowman  has this area in check as well
after a few minutes i was moving the character around with easeall in all this game seems worth the standard ps pricetag of  buckslots of depth good puzzles story controls and graphics
id pick this one up if i had the lootsm is without a doubt a very cool game with a good story and lots of gameplay
basically it is fantasy game where you play a detectivegangstersuperheroundead character who must find various items in order to beat the end boss
okay we have all been there before but sm does it aces and there is huge amount of game play involved with dozens of different unique weapons and lots of action with over three dozen different locations
i was playing sm for well over a week and enjoyed every minute of it
the voodoo weapons are really what makes this game so cool and they are extremely original
the maps are vast and there is a challange playing each one
this game is better than most other action games on the ps and is a must for any collectioni highly recommend that you give sm a whirl
you will not be dissapointedi wasnt necessarily a fan of snks fighting games
i was not used to their lack of fluidity in their gameplay fatal fury  for example
in the late s snk had progressed in their fighting games like the king of fighters series the samurai showdown series and the new fatal fury series
now snk has brought in four of their d fighters to the dreamcast to probably boost their popularity to a new level
now that the dreamcast is about to die snk decides to shut down as well but not because of the dc
now they released two of their last snk fighters
last blade  and fatal fury mark of the wolves aka garou mark of the wolves
now let me explain this game
the last blade  for dreamcast is a very impressive fighter with tons of surprises
the graphics are a bit blah 
the textures of the characters may look a bit dated just imagine playing a d fighter with bit characters and enviroments but the backgrounds look pretty impressive
the super moves to each character looks cool
and for the first time when you are about to arrive to your next battle you get an animated introduction to the stage youre about to arrive on fatal fury mark of the wolves has the same featureonly they do mostly just character introductions but it looks kinda dumb
its a very cool element to the animation but just not as good as the ones in fatal fury mark of the wolves
the gameplay is downright solid and perfectly balanced
people would say that this game feels dated but to me this is snk fighting at its best
the controls feel like youre playing samurai showdown all over again
and thats a good thing considering that samurai showdown was one of my favorite snk games
audiowise the music is totally whacked out with tracks resembling snes and genesis music
this is perhaps the most embarassing feature in the game
snk had great music in their fighters but thisis just horrible
sometimes snk doesnt know how to live in todays generation and i said sometimes
but on the plus side on the audio the voice acting is superb
these fighters act like theyre in a japanese drama movie or something
the game features lets just say they have a lot
various game modes unlockable endings and anything you can possibly ask for in a perfectly good fighting game
unfortunately last blade  didnt turn me into an snk nut
it was the fatal fury series and samurai showdown series that turned me into a fan
especially fatal fury mark of the wolves the latest fatal fury installment
anyway if youre a totally nuts about snk theres no reason why you should leave last blade  behindinstead of writing a whole new review i will instead copy and paste what i wrote on a message board
i think you should read what i wrote about madden  seeing as how my thoughts are not really an indepth review of the game
instead its about well you be the judge
read on pleasecan you believe i never owned a football game before and to my knowledge only played one once in my entire life
this was in  i just never liked football until a couple years agoanyway i bought madden  i know its an old game with outdated rosters but that doesnt matter to me much
i just want to have fun with the game
what kind of advice do you have for someone who understands football but other than that one time in  has never played a football game beforewill it take me a long time to understand what im doing
i cant fathom at the moment what it must be like for the quarterback to throw the ball to one of his players
it must be really hard to throw the ball to the correct guy and have him run as far as possible
i know nothing about what the speed of the game is going to be like either
all the players on the field might move around too quickly for me to have time to react to anythingthe reason i wanted madden  is because this game has a classic mode where you can go back to how football video games were played in the early s
this is good so in case the gigantic d graphics become too much of a problem for me at least i might have a shot at glory playing the game in an oldfashioned way
i wonder how many weeks or months it will take until it feels comfortable to play this game
how long will it take until understanding exactly whats happening on the field makes perfect senseanyway this madden game has me worried because looking through the instruction booklet each button does something different
i dont even know what most of these things mean
cycle defenders secondary shifts powerswim
what were playing football underwater now
unfortunately im having a pretty tough time with the game
the part i said a couple days ago about worrying about the speed of the game seems to be true i have hardly no time to react to the defense and offense of the computer opponents
its like making one mistake will really cost me
i did manage to get a touchdown with the cincinnati bengals
i guess luck was on my sidei personally dont think i have the necessary skills to understand which buttons should be pressed at the exact moment a play happens
it seems all the buttons are used on the controller including the four buttons at the top and apparently i have to press the right button at just the right time
if i make a mistake the other team will do some serious damage to me
if thats going to be the story of madden  well then im done with it
simple as that
if you actually can improve the more you play the game i will continue playing itits too confusing to me how after every play a bunch of options appear on screen asking me what i want to do next
i guess having your players line up on the field in a certain way is very important
i never have any idea what the right move is supposed to be so i just pick one and hope for the best
i figure hey im not a genius
unfortunately the game seems to be designed for people who know football like the back of their hands
there really needs to be an easy modethat classic mode i mentioned about how you can play football the way it was played in the early s is pretty tough also
not to mention slow
each play takes forever to execute because you keep being asked questions about the next play you want to do
to add insult to injury there seems to be a waiting period after you pick an option for the next play
its like these really old and dirty graphics actually require loading
the music is insanely catchy though
the title screen music i mean there is no music when playing a gameall i know when watching football is that you have three attempts to get across the yellow line a gain of  yards
apparently you need to be much smarter and have a better understanding of the technical aspects of football to be able to execute the proper plays in video game form
these madden games require you to be really smart and knowledgeable about the game itself
what i need is someone who has experience with madden games to come over and show me what to do
without help im a lost puppy in the rainwhat bothers me the most is that since they keep releasing new madden games every year its expected that everyone who picks up the newest one will understand the game immediately
the people who create these games dont realize how much trouble regular fans of football will have playing a game
you cant just tune in every sunday to watch a game and expect to understand video game football
it doesnt work that wayits entirely possible that someone like me could experience the madden series for the first time in february  despite the fact that the series has been around since the early s
i would love to see someone play the game i just bought madden  to see how you actually play the thingmore thoughtsto be honest one of the reasons i never played a football game earlier or watched the sport on tv was because i got pushed around a lot in gym class playing the game in high school and this gave me the bad impression that football is for big bullies for me only one sports game is needed per gaming console
i dont want to keep buying each new madden game or whatever every year just for minor updates
way too many unnecessary sports games are available in my opinionim giving the game  stars because im holding on to the hope that one day i will have a better understanding of how the game works and improve my skillsmy expectations were very high for madden  after playing ncaa i thought madden would be unbelievable
at first the graphics and body motion blows you away
clearly the graphics were improved from madden  also they have more lines for the commentator and playbyplay man john madden is not as annoying as madden  and they keep the great franchise mode and allow you to create expansion teams
however ea degraded some aspects of this game
first you can no longer get a pash rush unless you blitz
regardless of the pass rusher it is very difficult to beat the pass blocker
also you cannot stop the run effectively unless you blitz
i am very disappointed that there are not more defenses
you cannot put  players in the box without putting in the goalline team
also punting the ball is terrible in the game it is way to difficult to get a decent punt
this is the nfl punters can punt the ball  easy
and one aspect of this game that ea is lacking significantly is pass defense
ea will not be able to take this game to the next level until they figure out how to make pass defense realistic
they can start by not have the safeties burned deep on every deep ball
also cornerbacks usually keep the receivers in front of them but in this game receivers are behind them and cornerbacks usually get burned deep
it is way to easy to pass the ball in this game for the user and the computer which is evident by the computer only running the ball  times a game
this game is good but it is not an improvement from  it is different from  but the improvements are counterbalanced against its faults
i think ncaa  is a much better and realistic football game
i dont think it is a bad buy but dont expect too much
back to the drawing board for ea
please note that for any other software company this would be a good game i just expect much more from ea sports and that is why i buy ea sports gamesi recently purchased the new quotmadden quot for my ps and although its a good game i feel as if there is something missing
madden and summeral arent annoying like i thought they would be they actually make pretty good comments wo over doing it
the game play is pretty good although its a little hard to run and during the coin toss the players heads look sooo funny and a bit unproportioned in comparison to the rest of their body its hillarious
i do think that the dreamcasts football franchise of nflk is better even though ive been playing madden for almost ten years now dating back to the sega genesis
all in all its a pretty solid game and a good purchase for all of the madden fans out therefirst  let me say that madden  does play very well
the graphics are great  this game is a lot of fun
i buy this game for the franchise mode so this is really a review of that section of the game  and what needs to be improved for injuries  what does it take to have one of your own players get injured
not that i want them hurt  but the realism is gone when the whole league is suffering key injuries and all of my starters are in perfect health
why even have backups
they never see any playing timethe offseason needs some work
it seems in previous versions that the league would offer trades to you based on who you put on the trading block
i want that feature back
trading here is really boring as you simply scan the whole league  waiting for the green bar to shoot up when the other team accepts your trade
how about teams trading with one another during the seasonfree agency  this part is always fun but where are the superstars
they are simply always resigned by their current teams so there is never anyone out there worth bidding over
you rarely see anyone with a rating over  on the board
this feature needs to be deepenedholdouts  i have yet to even see onedoes this ever happenthe purpose of any game is to keep you coming back to play it over and over
ea needs to take out some of the monotony and put some more into franchise mode
perhaps one year we will see it happenlets face it madden  set the standard for playstation  football games
no other football game for the ps even came close to the gameplay or graphicsthis years version of the game gives you some nice enhancments over madden  but not as much as i would have expected
the ask the coach feature for offensive play selection has changed so that madden gives you advice
but the advice phrases are the same as last years in most cases the difference being madden is giving the adviceanother disappointment in this years version was the lack of focus on the addition of new commentary by john madden and pat summerall
if you played last years version long enough youll quickly start to hear some of the same commentary againanother thing they took away from the game which i thought was great is the comments made by players when scoring a touchdown or making a key play
quotall i do is score touchdownsquotthe gameplay has improved
kicking field goals and punts is now more difficult because of a new accuracy and power meter and the computers artificial intelligence is definitely increased from last yearin addition the new franchise mode and updated roster alone make the game worth buying
youll also enjoy a number of other features such as the ability to challenge a play and a new training mode where john madden teaches you the xs and os of footballa huge step over last years version
player models look better i like the way every single pass isnt a perfect spiral
the replay angles are awesome especially the triple strike thing or whatever they call it
the only thing that annoys me is when you make contact with someone thats where the ball dies
so most of the time if you knock them out of bounds the clock doesnt stop
or they wont get as many yards as you think they would
i like how you can challenge every play but watch what you challengethe only things you can argue are where the ball is down at and when its out of bounds
so you cant say a fumble was an incomplete
i just have one complaintwhen are they going to come out with the soundtrackthis is without a doubt the best football game out this year
ea has really improve the game play spiced up the graphics and generally kickedon this game
if you want the game to own this is itwith only a few slight problems this is a very good game
lets start off with the goodmadden cards  these rock
i admit i felt the best nfl game was the nfl k series until i played and used madden cards
the opportunity to use historic teams and players is a great idea
it adds a different element to the game which i enjoynfl realignment i really liked the fact that they included the new alignment for the  season and beyond
the addition of the houston texans was cool but i truly like being able to see what the league will look like next yeardepth  this game has depth and then some
you not only draft players you juggle the salary cap sign free agents resign current players etc  i dont see how much deeper you can go than thisgraphics of course they are great
the movements are fluid the bodies are realistic  everything a modern gamer could want in a football game
i do wish they showed more of the stadiums and i wish that when you win the superbowl there was more of a celebration to it more graphics and done in cinema mode would be cool rather than simply being carted off the field but these are minor thingsthe badpassing and running  ive found passing is quite difficult and running seems to be quite easy
maybe its just me but i have a very hard time completing passes while i seem to run for over  yardsgame on a regular basisdefensive line the defensive line rush is almost nonexistant
i usually play one of the guys on the line and have found its quite difficult to get to the passer
however the computer doesnt seem to have much of a problem rushing my qbmadden and pat i have to admit the announcing is horrible
they really need to get more lines and some get rid of some of the old ones
pat still uses the quotthe forearm shiverquot line and madden is still annoying
the announcing for nfl k was in my opinion betterall in all you cant go wrong with this game
i didnt find it to be quite as fun as ncaa but thats not to say its a bad game
on the contrary this is a good game and well worth the pricethis is a clear improvement over madden k just the much much better less annoying banter in the commentary is worth playing
everything else is all a bit better than madden k but there are some areas i thought were well executed aside from having more lines than it had too much pop
there is a nice quick little tutorial to get you started
k now allows you to completely create and play a team in franchise mode you will need to replace one of the existing teams though
there are situational games you can play to earn madden cards scoring the most tds in  mins for example which is fun if you want to just spend a few minutes sharpening up your skills
everything looks nicer and better animatedi want to defend the difficulty a bit it does get hard in the passing game if you go beyond the easy play modes but i think the ai just tightens down their secondaries unless you have enough run plays or short passes
however ive got big quick good receivers like moss who doesnt seem to break away as often as i would imagine against slower and lower rated defenders even subing positions to create mismatches
however even though my ol is rated  my running back rated an ok  with a break tackle of  and  speed gets stuff a lot even against weaker opponentsthe ai also seemed to have these drives that other reviewers mentioned where nothing could stop them ive got upper s ratings in my corners and s in my dl and safeties and im talking about a few drives when i tried to defend against the texans
as noted the ai never gets kicking penalties
stopping the ai passing game is really hardfinally in franchise mode i really wish they would allow you to trade multiyear picks instead of just the coming years pick
i also wish they would start downgrading the asking price for free agents as the year progresses without anyone picking them up
and please can we speed up some of the animations like the kick offall in all this is a very good game and is recommend highlythis is a good football sim
fairly realistic except for those times when the cpu cheats cause its losing
i liked the franchise mode the best but i only made it through a season before getting bored
rent it before you buy itthe game is pretty much the same as  except for a few minor changes here and there
the graphics look slightly better the ai covers the pass better and is harder to burn coaches are now more active in the game and are more individual tony dungy wont be as emotional as other coaches etctheres now cheerleaders the madden card system is a little more advanced with different kinds of packs and new cheats and classic players you can create teams etc
about the  versions the gamecube will be inferior due to a smaller memory card i think i read that in  it will be fixed while the xbox and ps will be pretty close
also personally i think madden k is better then sega nfl k but sega still has that unrealistic arcade feel which some prefer over maddeni  have already tried the game out
 i dont like these madden games at all but im going to tell how good it is from a gamers point of view
this game is a decent improvement from madden  the gameplay is almost the same on the field accept for that the players look better
off the field it earned  of the  stars i gave it
im not saying the onfield gameplay is bad but its the same as last game
there is less fake onehanded catching and harder defense which is a good improvement
off field you can create your own team draft actual ncaa players that are in the upcoming draft not the michael vick draft more madden cards and sort of make your own jersees
anything im missing is probly not that big of a deal
overall this is a game that will keep you interested for quite a while since it has franchise and the create a team thing but is the same on field gameplay as the first video game that i ever played was sonic the hedgehog  to this day after donkey kong  it is my all time favorite video game
i also own the original sonic the hedgehog sonic and knuckles  and sonic d blast and have played sonic the hedgehog  sonic spinball sonic cd drrobotnics mean machine i think thats what its called sonic r and sonic adventure and have enjoyed all of them
so when sonic advance came out it was a no brainer that i was going to get it
after abandoning the d format with sonic d blast and the sonic adventure series sonic team the games developers have gone back to the original d side scrolling format which i think was last seen in sonic and knuckles
this decision made the game very similar to the original  sonic games and some may even consider this sonic the hedgehog  the levels are all new but a bit similar to some of the old levels and the format where you face robotnick at the end has been kept but unlike in the sonic the hehgehog series where you andor a friend control one or two people on the screen at once the game has the sonic and knuckles formula where you chose your character before you start your game
the characters you can chose from are sonic tails knuckles and amy each has a special ability that will make them better for some stages than other characters
i would have liked to have each character have there on set of levels because there are only  zones each but one with  acts if sonic team had done that format there would have been  levels and  acts total
also the special stage is not up to par with the ones for genesis instead of running into a check point with  rings you have to search the level to find the special stage and the stage itself is not as fun as the old special stages
but this game has some other nice features to make up for the lack of levels there are time trials and a virtual pet game called chaos garden the point of the game is to raise an animal named chao by taking care of there basic needs
most needs require you purchasing something which costs rings but you can earn rings by playing in little mini games
overall this game is a little short but if you own a game boy advance and like sonic it is a must havei got this game a long time ago when it first came out
it seems somewhat simpler than the original sonic games on the sega genisis but its a good fun game
theres a bunch of levels and characters so youll be playing for a good long time
as always everything is super fast lots of loops and rings and theres cool music in the backround
if you want a fun handheld sonic game get thisfinally sega has done something that will please many game boy advance owners
they have brought sonic the hedgehog the quotmascotquot of sega to nintendos gbaif you are familiar with the sonic series on the genesis you know just what youre getting here
this game brings back the d sonic from the good ole genesis days
looking for rings multiple degree loops in a row and dr robotnik
you got em
theyre all here
if you could do it in the genesis sonic games you could do all that plus a lot more in this gamethere are  levels and  stages but to see get to the th stage you must beat the game as everyone and collect all  emeralds
the stages in each level are very fun to play
as you go on each level gets harder and harder
there are also  special stages which you get to by collecting warp springs instead of coinsthe graphics for this game arent as good as the original games but the characters are upgraded
sonic tails knuckles and amy look just like they do in the dreamcast games
the thing that makes the graphics suffer some is that the gba isnt backlit some levels are very hard to see without good lighting
overall the graphics are good with amazing backgrounds and animationsthe sound effects for this game are amazing
they fit perfectly with each level and stage
the  speakers of the gba are not strong enough to play the music in very high quality but with headphones the music is solid and smooth
you can even use music from older games as well but you need to find themthe two reasons why i didnt give this game a perfect score is because the game is way too short
all youll find in this game is  levels and  stages
also it is very hard to get to the special stages and they are very difficult
they are pretty much like the special stages in sonic another addition to this game is a mini chao garden for which you can connect your gba to a gamecube and transfer data and do other things
this is a great feature in sonic advanceoverall this is a great game
this is the gba game that everyone should own
if you are a sonic fan like me you should get this game
youll really like itsthis game turned out to be pretty good
its basiclly the good classic sonic game with a few improvmentsand disappointments
it has the classic sidescrolling action and a nice varity of characters
it also has the nice robonik battles and mutiple routes through the levels
the tiny chao gardens ability to link with gamecube is a definent plus
now for the downside
the game is to short and on the easy side
the tiny chao garden was a disappointment since all it is is a small box with a d chao and a few low payout minigames
overall i think this is a pretty fun game but i probobly would of givin it a star rating if i didnt have sabwell it has finally happened
somthing so groundbreaking that a few years ago seemed impossible
yes sonic the hedgehog has arrived on a nintendo system
some would think that this would destroy the image of segas mascot but it actually worked out for the betterin this game sonic finally gets back to his d sidescrolling roots
just about everything that made the genesis series great is in this version
you want rings
theyre there
degree loops
mmhmm its got em
chracters so quick that they actually run faster than the camera
yes you can still do it
if you could do it on the genesis you can do it hereand do morethe graphics here arent quite up to par with the originals but hey its a handheld
if you want genesis graphics go play a genesis
ok
even though the characters really show the pixels the animations more than make up for them
the character models have also received an update
sonic tails knuckles and amy look just like they do in the grownup dreamcast versions
the only thing that makes the graphics suffer is the fact that the gba isnt backlit
if you dont have a seperate light some levels are hard to see
but overall the graphics are nicethe music is also another high point
even though the gba s speaker cant handle the volume and effects it gets better with headphones or better yet an actual stereo
the music is wellcomposed and matches the levels beautifully
theres also music from the older games too but youll have to find themhint theyre in the sound testtheres also a mini chao garden for which you can connect to a gamecube and transfer data and other thingsso why am i not giving this game a perfect score you ask
i have two reasons
one is the special stages
in this game you must find the warp springs instead of collecting rings
they are also very difficult
they are sort of like the ones in sonic  but instead of running you are falling and must direct yourself in their path
my other gripe is that the game is way too short
 levels and  stageswell actually  but you have to beat the game with everyone and collect all  emeralds to see the th is all youll find herebut overall this is a great game and everyone who has a gba should own it
trust me youll like itim a hardcore sonic freak and to be honest i thought this game would be better
unlike the other sonic games it does not have the same lasting appeal
i was kind of bummed when i realized it but the graphics are much improved and the chao garden adds some funthe game is pretty good
any fan of the original genesis titles will love this game
its a bit short though and doesnt have a whole lot of replay valuesonic the hedghog for the gba rocks
one of the best handhelds i have ever played
with many different worlds and different levels within those
you can play as four different characters including sonic tails knuckles amp amy rose
many different moves and a very cool feature called the quottiny chao gardenquot this is especially fun if you have the gcn and sonic adventure  battle as well as the gcngba link cable
in the tiny chao garden you can get some rare and exclusive eggs with the rings you have collected in the two minigames and adventure mode
such as the gold silver amp jewel eggs
if you love sonic and have a gba i would definetly recommend this game
i would have to say the levels are a little bit shorter and more simple than i would like them but its still a cool game for your collectionthankyouvaporlike my title says i really think this game is very good
ive actually been playing it pretty straight since the weekend
it is a combo of simpark and the others but with the cool factor of finding grafting and hatching dino eggs then placing them in pens for your visitors to see
very cool idea for gbadownside
the manual is garbage
konami has never really been known for great manuals but come on guys
for a sim you could have at least thrown in a little more infooverall id say if you like sims like this or even if your interested in the idea the game is worth it
the replay value alone is worth it
especially if you have friends that have the game
swapping dna is a pretty cool ideaecks vs sever is the fifth best fps for the gba and the rd released for the system
ecks vs sever was the first fps i played for the gba and was awed by how good the graphics and gameplay were
i had to keep reminding myself that i was in fact playing a game boy
now  years later we have exactly a dozen fpss available for the gba and ecks vs sever still remains in my top 
i enjoyed ecks vs sever more than its sequel ballistic ecks vs sever because all around its a better game
we have a great story realistic weapons realword environments and beautifully rendered enemy spirits
the game is awesomethis game hails from an era when the average hardcore gamer was about as hardcore as todays average casual gamer
in that context diablo was a great game because most people just played it through once or twice and were done
but in the modern day where late game is king this game shows its age
this game has a very low quality late gamegood classic game with developed world
a bit repetitive decent even for being over a decade
oldfiring up diablo ii takes me back to my early days of dd
  i recently recevied the game from my cousin who has been a hardcore diablo fan since day onethe battle chest is a great value
although ive been slashing my way through d i just found out that a friend plays d online at battlenet
lucky for me and others whove discovered the battle chest ive got both gamesas many others have pointed out the interface is rather intuitive
ive played d online for the most part
starting out is a real challenge
if youre killed with no backup weapons back in town you need to trudge out and reclaim your posessions barehanded
and the fiends who inhabit the diablo landscape arent going to make it easy for youas characters develop they really do take on their own personality
as you level up you decide where skill points will be distributed
will you focus on lightning skills or become the master of two handed axe wielding 
its up to you
lots of todays teens will easily get drawn into the adventuring to be sure
but for for the oldschool adventurers who yearn to dig out their sided die one more time give diablo a whirldiablo  is a welldone well puttogether game
what i dont understand is why it has such a reputation for being addictive
its fun for a while but boy is it ever monotonousthe dungeons are randomly generated which gives you the idea that the game has some replayability but they are so bland and featureless that it doesnt really make a difference
each area is a plainlooking labyrinth with a few features that start repeating themselves after you have been playing for five minutes
each level is filled with hordes of the same  or  enemies that you clean out by furiously clicking the mouse buttons and tapping your hot keys
when you advance to a new level the same  or  enemies are there but they are a different color and they have a few more hit points or they do a bit more damagethe game never really challenges you until you face a big boss
fighting the bosses is the most fun and the only really challenging part of the game
the bosses require resourcefulness to defeat
the rest of it can be won by repeating the same set of simple tactics over and over againthe complete lack of a storyline in this game doesnt help
it is about as interesting as space invaders
its too bad because a good story could have made each level more rewardingto make matters worse this game has no quick save key
you actually have to quit this game to save it
if you do this then you start off back in town and the monsters in every area are resurrected
you have to find a waypoint in order to save the game unless you feel like cleaning out the same portion of dungeon again to get back to where you wereand what do you do if your computer crashes after  minutes of unsaved playing
stinks to be you i guessi dont want to be all negative about this game
it has an excellent interface which has been copied in some way so many times that its hard to keep track
you can customize this interface and set up hot keys however you like
the character trait and skill point system is a great way to advance levels
i especially like the skill trees
each character class has its own unique skill tree which allows you to develop spells and other special abilities
a character starts off learning the simpler skills and progresses gradually to learn more powerful skills
the graphics and animation are pretty good but the spell effects are the best part of the game
the game is long and has a lot of different classes to play with which means that if you enjoy it you will find this set to be great valueits kind of a downer jumping over to diablo  from brilliant and rich games like planescapetorment and baldurs gate 
diablo  is sort an arcade game on the pc
i guess that everyone has their own preferencei bought this for my teenage son for christmas and he said it was awesome
he really seems to enjoy playing this pc game
graphics look good as well
cant wait to see diablo iiimy sons liked this game a lot and so i decided to check it out
it is a lot of fun and i even created my own charachter and got somewhat far in the gamei recommend it and im a mom
it is not boring at all and you can create different charachters for a different playid have to say that diablo  is the king of massive dungeon crawls for the pc
you have a massive world to explore which was beautifully rendered for its time with hordes upon hordes of crazy undead and demons
there is a fair variety of classes to choose from and enough different skills and items to make the characters fairly unique
there is a smattering of story throughout the game and its well done enough to be worth paying attention to
to add to the replay value blizzard has the online servers where you can meet up with people from all over the world and play for free
since the game doesnt require much of a computer most people with a computer can enjoy it a broadband connection helps a lot for online play howeverboth games diablo and diablo ii have some nice combat smooth spells and mice enemies and there seems to be a lot of it
it has specialtymagic items for you to enhance your gameplay
even the online gameplay is rather smooth and free virtually any product by blizzard is worth your money and this is no exceptionthis is a great game
we recently played through diablo  and  and we are currently playing diablo  diablo  is a good improvement over diablo  the story is good and it is easier to get look and having a companion is very helpful
though the graphics and controls will probably be frustrating to people who have never played older games i think that it well worth it to see the history of diablo and to see a major part of the evolution of this genrethis is an old game and i wanted to review this for people like me that might want to play this game for the first time
first it is hard to go wrong with a blizzard game
two this is something that any rpg fan should try out
read on if you want to hear about a great timeconsuming rpgthis game is really a lot of fun
there are seven character classes when the expansion set is applied to the game and this means there can be a great deal of diversity in gameplay
there is more than likely a character class to suit any gamer
i chose to play as a druid on my first playthrough
after you pick a character you get thrown right in with really no cushion to speak ofwhen the game starts you begin the first quest and any tiny little enemy is daunting
to make matters worse you cant restart from an old save spot
this is the first game like that that i have ever played and it made me really think twice about battle strategy and potion usage
if you die in the game you go back to your starting place and you lose all your gold and the items you had equipped
if you quit right after dying the next time you play your corpse will be next to your character
you can retrieve your items but the gold is still lost
at the beginning i lost a whole lot of gold
if you keep playing right after dying you can travel to find your corpse where you died and you can retrieve the gold and the items
i want to just emphasize that this game is no walk in the parkgraphically this was pretty good for when it was released
i have no problem with it and the style suits the game well
the areas are interesting and the characters are all unique
i play games on a laptop and it was nice to play a game without having to turn all the visual options to low
so i highly recommend this game to anyone that is playing games on an older or less powerful machinethe contents of the battle chest make this game highly worth the money
i spent forty dollars  tax on it at gamestop and i am still happy with the purchase
buy this on amazon though because you can save ten bucks
the guide that comes in this is totally worth it
it gives a lot of detail to the different abilities each character can learn and it gives brief walk throughs for quests
it goes into even more detail with full lists of enemies and items and all kinds of things
if you really like to dig deep into a game this book can help on diablo this game has enough content to make it fun for a long time
it has free online play with friends or random people
the expansion adds an extra act into the game
the seven different characters will make for a different experience and the individual characters can be leveled up in countless different ways
it would be pretty much impossible to find another player that made the same character as youa great deal of fun is in store for those with patience
i gave this a four out of five because even though its great i dont like the way the game saves itself or the initial level of difficulty with no real ingame advice
i enjoy every other part of this game and i think it is a great investment for people playing on a budgetim knocking off  star because hellfire washnt included
hellfire is a soughtafter  pricey expansion to diablo  that can end up costing more than this boxed set
while the graphics of these games are blase compared to the dungion siege games that mimiced it  a lack of character designer it has randomly generated dungeons so it may be quite some time before you crawl through one youve elready been through before
with each characters statistics so characteristically different   games difficulty settings  so many different level designs youll be playing diablo  for months
seriouslyi havent even gotten to diablo ii yet
play it for all its worth
 snag hellfire while youre at it
i also reccomend this game for female gamers like myself who prefur lessgirly gamesprice was right and my grandchildren enjoyed itfor a while anyway till they thought graphics kind of outdated
i enjoyed playing the game better than halo  but that is because im slow and no matter how my grandchildren try to protect me i dont last too long
old fart was taken or the would have been my namei love the diablo series because of its easy playability
its just your basic dungeon crawler
it doesnt require you to sit in front of it for hours or to play straight through
i mean it is hours  hours of play time but you can walk away for a week and not have a problem picking up where you left off
also you can create different characters of each class and enjoy the game all over again because of the different play style each has and because the map changesdownsidesyou cant just log off in the middle of the dungeon as next time you will be logged on in town and have to fight your way back through to the dungeon and to the place you left off
monsters respawn when you log outi think the interface could be done a little better
i like to play solely with my mouse
but i could mostly do it that wayi will definitely be buying diablo i was definitely impressed with diablo ii
the expansion only made it better
the graphics the gameplay everything is flawless
i have only a few pet peeves with this gamea
playing singleplayerblows
this game basically steers you into playing onlineb
i had a lot of lag online
i have a cable modem
and i had lag
thats not rightc
the game is way to difficult
i put it down and gave it back to my friend because he would make fun of me for not leveling up by  every hour
i barely got to level nine in a weekstill however it was pretty fun and quite addicting for a while
i would reccomend it to anyonebefore you could make friends come over to your house but where could you go
nowhere
now they have made an all new downtown area where you can go and meet your friends that you created and make new friends that are strangers too
i think that this is the best simulation game ever and i cant wait untill the new sims vacation comes out butthe only problem i have found with this and its the same with all of the previous sims games the sims livin it up house party and it probably will be for the next vacation is that the sims get tired too quickly
i know if you dont eat for ten hours you would get hungry and if you havent got to the toilet you would need to but its really annoying when youre talking to someone and all of a sudden your sim has an accident and i think they should make it so they last longerthis quotpackquot is one that i never really got into
it just allows you to go on dates and go shopping downtown
i found this pack really boeringi am a huge fan of the sims and have bought all of the other expansion packs toobut i found myself having some huge problems with this game
there are so many bugs i cant stand to play itlike when i go downtown my sims date always freezes up in the booth therefor making me stuck downtown for an eternity unless i exit without saving
and that really is a dissapointment when you get relationships built up during that time
and the waiterwaitress always freezes up
and on the box they advertise an old lady who bothers you
well i have never seen her in my game oncethe bugs actaully didnt start showing up until after a while
they wernt there at first
i really do like this game a lot and if it didnt have those bugs it would be my favoritei noticed the company released the game in a smaller box at the same time of release for the vacation expansion
i wonder if they fixed those bugs and i have thought about buying it to find outbut anyway i love the new options and the fact you can bring them downtownthis was a really good expansion pack
i love to take my sims downtown
i really like how there are many different types of places to go to unlike the vacation ep which has many places but really only  types of places
you also can edit the places you go to
there are also tons of new objects walls etc
that you can use in your sims homes too
your sims can really get to know eachother well as there are tons of new optionsmy suggestions to make it better would be a faster loading time the option to take more than one other person out something that would make the townies get out of the path of the cars and it also gets kind of annoying that they come back to the house at the same time they left but all their needs are differenthot date provides sim fans with things that other expansion packs have failed to do before  more interactions and an opportunity to leave your house
that in itself is worth to  simoleans that the expansion pack costs
the downtown area is a lot of fun to look at and interact with  there are many interesting characters to interact with and your neighbors show up there toolots of great new items  my particular favorites are the cuddle couch where i have discovered new interactions such as quotcaressquot and quotembracequot and the heartshaped hot tub where you can quotwashquot quotcuddlequot and quotkissquot your date
there are some new decorative elements as well although not as expansive as living large or house partythe best part of this gamehowever was the new interactions
you can ask particular questions now including if the sim wants to come home with you
there are too many new ones to list but heres a few extreme tickling growling checking out kissing passionately kissing romantically etc
etc
consequently relationships have become more complex with the addition of a quotlong termquot relationship bar and a quotshort termquot relationship bar
the latter displays how youre faring with your companion in the short term fluctuates wildly and the former is your longer relationship quotbasequot if you will which is fairly steady
different combinations on these bars produce different opportunities for social interactionsso why did i give it  stars
there seem to be gameplay problems similar to the release of the first game
remember when it took your sim  minutes to drink a cup of coffee
it now takes a staggering  hours to be seated order and receive your food in a restaurant im not even talking about eating the food
also the downtown scenes are filled with lots of action and people and that can put a strain on older computers resulting in some pauses and choppy movement
if youve got a new powerful computer this shouldnt be a problemall in all this is a great addition to a great franchise
its a little racy although i think the pictures are relatively tame the sounds are surprisingly suggestive but it is rated teen so your kids arent going to see anything they havent seen on tv or dawsons creek
i highly recommend it and hope that maxis comes up with a patch to fix some of the timing problemsit was a pretty fun game but its pretty hard
its not any house party or livin large
but i really liked it
if your a die hard the sims fan you will like thiswow
finally a downtown
and boy is it huge
ill let you in on a little secret that maxis forgot to mention even with my computer  mb ram penitum ii brand new radeon d accelerator the downtown sticks a little bit
sure its bearable and most people wont care but it is a bit irritating
oh well there aint no perfect gameone more minor complaint if thats what youd like to call it is that this expansion pack is smarter when it comes to making friends
complimenting a person over and over will not make them your friend
the computer now can figure out that youre a fake when you do this
you have to mix it up and it is much easier and much more tempting i may add to go too far too early
it takes time to make a friend
so in that respect the game makes it a bit harder
now out with the positivei loved being able to go downtown
if the carpool is there waiting for you to go to work you can hop in a cab and be back several hours later but the carpool is still there and the clock resets to the time youve left
your energy meter goes down while youre gone of course
however it goes down a bit more slowly than it would if you were home
the social fun comfort and room ratings go way up briefly when you first arrive downtown but then go back down when you get homenow heres a feature i know youre gonna love if you have the sims
say youve got john and harley each living in a different house
you can go into harleys game and go downtown and you can see john downtown as well even though you are not in his game
so john gets the same social benefit as harley does even if it isnt his game
cool huhoverall the game is a great buy
it adds more gameplay rather than just a bunch of objects that you can download from other fan sites
the game is a must buy for any sims owners
this is the one to get if you can get just one
second would be livin large and last the partypooper house party
happy datingill admit it this was my first expansion pack ever and because first impressions last longer i was fascinated by it since i had no other expansion pack to compare it to at the timethe sims hot date is by far the most creative expansion pack ever followed by house party and superstar
i personally use it to target sims and create love triangles the typical boy meets girl and the other way around as wellthe sims hot date by hearsay is probably desired mainly to invite other sims home from a first date or a first time experience of hanging out with that sim
just as in reality hopefully that move is far too quick and smooth and eventually the simll just walk away in disgust whichll result in your relationship with them going downthis expansion pack is probably the first ever to enable travelling to other lots where a lot of relations can be made between other sims
its really helpful especially if youve got the house party expansion pack and thatd truly be a night to remember though i dont know whether townies nonneighbor sims by default also arrive at the party but special invitation ie
using the phone that one extra time to invite them overll do the tricki recommend the sims hot date its pretty different and i cant imagine my sim life without itthe newest expansion for the revolutionary game the sims doubles your fun by finally allowing your characters to go out into the world and interact with people or go on dates in downtown locales such as restaurants nightclubs clothing stores and the beach
you can build stores as well but they give you just about everything you need right off the bat so youre pretty much left with building weird looking stuff that already existsthe installation once it stopped crashing also gives you more options for interaction you can kiss fiery nicely peck etc
and you can improve a sims interests in something by reading magazines increasing their chances with more people they come in contact with
great stuff and like the expansions before it totally necessary and right on timehello peoplethinking about buying this title yeah
well i believe if youve bought the last two expansion packs house party livin it large then this one will definetly be one youll want to buy since this one has more items compared to the last two expansion packs and that it is the freedom to take your date around in the townalthough i find the game somewhat harder in terms of trying to get friendly with peoplewellin a sense of being friends or being very friendly if you know what i mean  becoming friends is easybut trying to find a lover is hard stuff man
instead of being like the last version of the sims you cannae really dive straight in and kiss them dammit instead you have to work round it because they get kinda picky
peck on the cheek goes a long way which is one of the new interactive options availableive not played the game to its extent yet but another cool feature as mentioned earlier is the options to take your partner or yourself if your not cool enough to the town
remember that you could give gifts to people in the last versions
well in this one you go out and buy your own gifts your own cloths etc and take your date to dinner and heheplay footsieits definetly best to buy this game peopleits funny and well worth itnote its not mentioned on amazon but this game works on windows  and in my country hehe this game is for  yo and overyoud understand why when you buy ithope you enjoy reading this and hope you buy this titleeveryone who knows video games knows that ea sports are always the leaders in sports games of all kinds
ice hockey is no exception and theyve put out the best hockey games on the market since the early s
no other company has captured the feel and the intensity of the coolest game on earth with such precision and it seems each year they find a way to outdo themselves
and theyve done it again with nhl so whats new this year
well for starters the players have all new and even more realistic animations there are more types of passes dekes checks and goal celebrations to name a few
almost every player in the nhl has their reallife mug in this game and the faces react with even more expression to every event
the game story feature gives the game a more tv broadcast feel the highlights are hitandmiss though
youve now got a breakaway and save cam which puts you right over the shoulder of either the shooter or the goalie as it happens
it takes some getting used to but if you find it annoying you can turn it off
the emotion meter actually pumps up your players as the momentum shifts and theyll play better if its peaked
you can even collect upper deck nhl cards and use them to increase your players stats
this just adds to an already great game youve still got the season mode createaplayer and all the rest from previous games too
but best of allnow at last you can play online
finally you can see just how good you truly are by taking on anyone in the world
these guys aint the innovators for nothing
of course everything graphics sound and statwise is just as spectacular as always
youre definitely there as it happens
and theres the return of mario lemieuxgreat as this game is though i actually found a couple of faults with it
standing out the most is the color commentary
while its humorous at first it gets very repetitive very quickly
bring back darrell reaugh
or john davidson at least good thing you can turn it off
also if youre new to the nhl series get ready for pain
theyve turned up the ai this year and even on medium difficulty i got bounced around a lot no matter which team i used or who i was playing
start out on easy or even beginner mode and learn the basics first
another big one is that even though you can create a whole team from complete scratch you still cant take it through the season mode
you can still take it online or play it in a regular game but id love to put a team together and take the stanley cup with iton the whole ea sports has delivered again and hockey fans and gamers around the world can now rejoice
dont miss out on this one
the world is watching youea might want to modify their slogan for this game to say quoteven if its not in the game its in the gamequot  a prominent arcade feel has been incorporated into this classic sports game and it actually takes away from the game experiencewhile i am not a hardcore hockey gamer mainly because im just not that good at it i am somewhat of a purist and the bells and whistles added to this incarnation of eas nhl series are somewhat silly and certainly distracting
for example a big hit or great save will generate several slowmotion replays right in the middle of the action leaving you uncertain and thus vulnerable when you suddenly return to live action
when you score or make a big play words announcing your achievement may pop up on the screen and the display for some reason makes me think of the old arcade games i played as a youth
the concept of quotcollectingquot nhl cards for myriad achievements just seems weird to me if i want to see easter eggs and cheats in a game and i dont incidentally i am more than content to know that such secrets are available for free all over the internet
even the game announcers have taken to making plain silly remarks for the sake of humor alone
periodic game summaries seem like a good idea in theory but quickly become annoying
many of these new quotshowyquot features can be turned off but i cant really see why the greatest sport game franchise in history feels compelled to prostitute itself to attract  new probably younger playersthe game itself i must say is still excellent
the action is as intense as ever the set of skills required to excel has increased and important new features from real hockey have made their way into the game
the ability to make a scoop pass is much appreciated as is the ability to knock pucks out of the air and up on to your stick
goalie animation is improved making room for some pretty spectacularlooking saves
a new feature i do like is animation of the crowd reacting to the gameplay
overall however i feel that nhl  is superior to this game particularly in terms of gameplay
icing twoline passes and the like just dont seem to happen enough in this game regardless of the settings i choosei find myself playing minutes on end without a stoppage of play which does my left thumb even more damage than usual
i have a harder time keeping up with where my teammates are as well
perhaps the most disappointing feature of nhl  is the animation of players following a goal
basically the scorer sticks his arms up and just stands there for a minute then after the replay some other teammates come around him to congratulate him
this goes to make goalscoring almost anticlimacticall in all this is still a great game but it is saddled with flaws not of performance but of design
i buy this game every year as soon as it comes out going back to  and i will continue to do so
sadly though this years release comes down to being a purchase based on loyalty rather than enjoyment
purists i feel safe to say will be much better served by simply embarking on a brand new season of nhl  and waiting to see if this years hopefully anomalous trend toward arcade action is reversed in nhl pros  graphics game play controls
better than any console hockey game
it convinced me to not by xboxcons  trade system is lame
you can usually trade up across the league
in the real league there is such a thing as a franchise player
this game throws that idea out the window
the online component doesnt workim a regular player of the nhl series since nhl
i like nhl because the gameplay is slightly improved  certain moves dont always produce goals defenseman can poke the puck away you can pass over other sticks though the programmers idiotically give this  percent success when it should be closer to  percent and it has a bit of a slower feel which is more realistic
but if youre a regular player you might be very disappointed with some of the changes or lack thereof
first of all i was very much looking forward to new faces for players who are relatively new or at least new as of the beginning of last year
for example allstar goalie roman cechmanek flyers starters since september  like ruslan fedotenko new players like dopita etc
all lack faces
in fact i cant find one new face at all since nhl   in addition the rosters arent quite right and usually exclude new additions during the summer for philly like dopita brendl boulerice  all starters
second i was looking forward to new colour commentary  the entire commentary is nothing but bad jokes with no comments on the players at all
worse these jokes just get repeated
third this joking has been taken into the arena announcements
one of the things i most enjoyed about nhl was its realism of feeling like you were in the arena
now all of the realistic arena announcements have been replaced by a handful of stupid joke announcements  quotif you are a single woman in your twenties id like to meet youquot or quoti just inhaled a balloon doesnt my voice sound funnyquot  or quotif your car is a  then you should buy a new carquot  if these sorts of changes are for you then definitely buy the game right away
if like me you were mostly interested in updates of the stats faces rosters etc
then youll be disappointed
and yes the quotcardsquot cheats are stupid  you get a deck of cards for boostcheats on league players you have no control over
if youve never owned an nhl game then this is definitely the best out thereby the way the automatic update feature is buggy  which is probably okay since ea has not put out any updates or even updated rosters though we are already in the season and these rosters were as of julywell i am finally back to review the add on pack for red alert  yuris revenge
yuris revenge almost seems pointless because the ai in the game is still the same it seems all the back to the original command and conquer
the multiplayer aspect of the game is a huge plus
but lets talk about different aspect of yuris revenge single playerthe game  the storyline is very odd and weirder now that red alertyuris revenge is messing with time travel
yuri has taken over the world with his psychic dominators and now it is up to you allies or soviets to go back in time and foil his plans
there are two jurassic park like scences which really play out funny
ray wise has made another appearance in this movie which really goes to show you how well his acting career is doing lol
pretty simple rules apply here destroy yuri and stop his psychic dominators
one of the battles will even take you to the moon to fight yurithe graphics are what to be expected from a rts
not anything really special to look at but your standard d explosions and firefights
but i still love how much command and conquer has come from the first game and its pixalated unitsthe gameplay is very nice with many new features and weapons
it is now even easier to get veteran units than before and i dont know what i would do without the ability to garrison buildings
the battle fortress is a very awsome unit next to the tank killers and the soviets still rule with the apoc tanksgameplay balance  man dont start me on this again because i could go on for hours
i have seen better ai in quake  and even star trek armada
and again you only have to build a certain unit to pretty much destroy the computer
on the allies side its all about building prism tanks
amass about  of these units and you can destroy any base
on the soviet side all you have to build is about  apoc tanks and you can overwhelm any base
playing around with different stratagies is fun but sooner or later you are ready to whip the tar out of the computer and complete the missionoverall i found this game to be enjoyable and a worthy add on to red alert
with different units and three different sides to play in multiplayer it makes to be quite spectacular
yuri on the other hand was a complete   his taunting in the game was pretty annoying and it really seems he could not even mind control himself a pizza
but it was still enjoyable
i wonder what new command and conquer will come next after renegadeyuris revenge gives rebirth to the campc red alert series
with a new story line weapons and structures improved controls and helpful features and an entirely new army to command yuris revenge is one of the coolest strategy games ever made
the only things to complain about is that there is no yuri campaign the allied and soviet campaigns are relatively short and yuris arsenal is kind of weak relying almost completely on mindcontrol weapons
also the game is somewhat easy
anyway yuris revenge should be on all campc fans hard drivesbeing a large cc fan it was great seeing the buildings the vehicles and the nod forces from this perspective
all in all the game was fun to play and have faster paced action tha mohaa
but this game misses on a few things the ai is the worst of any recent fps game i have played
the online game play is very laggy and with everyone just building vehicles it was boring
the cut scenes though pretty well done looked like they were painted on
the end bosses there were only  or  thank god were terrible
you cant out run or out manuever them
all you can do is stand there in front of them and keep shooting till they diehere is what was good other than what i have already mentioned the graphics were better than some of the reviews were saying if your graphics arent very good its time for a better video card the music is awesome
nick havoc is a very cool character
the weapons were pretty cool
got to use every weapon more than once
some games like rtcw  mohaa you were able to get through the game only using about half of the weapons available
driving many vehicles
you get to use many different vehicles and fight other vehiclesoverall i liked this game alot but compared to rtcw  mohaa something was missinga little hint while playing the game
if you find some of your other weapons running low on ammo and you will because on different levels enemies only use certain weapons use your little pistol and aim for the head
you would be surprised at how quickly some enemies will die with one pistol shot to the headi would recommend this game unless you are looking for good online game then i would tell you to look elsewhere
happy huntingi only give it  stars because i only played the demo and because the severs are a bit laggy but its being fixed and i got to play for an hour and i love it not just run and gun like most frist person shooters u need to think and plan i just hope the single player is good and that alot of moders make a ton of cool mods  i cant wait till the really good moders out there get a hold of this game and make some outstanding mods this game is really shaping up to greatnesssi was really skeptical of this game at first there are so many fps that rip your money that a caution light or two went off looking at the box  but this one is worth the purchasesystem requirements for the box isnt that high but you wont be able to really enjoy how the game looks unless running g mhz and at least a g ti
in my mhz athlon ti it ran flawlessly at x resolutions maxed out graphics
tested on a g gts system it ran choppy at times and graphics and resolutions are considerably lower quality
easily playable on both systemsgraphics looked alot like a ut engine with charactor animations done very well
environmental textures were kept very simple and need much improvement but dont take anything away from the game
aircraft and other vehicles make continual appearances adding to the war aspect of the gamethe games plot follows other fps games where your running around and they are sending you objectives as you proceed
theres a typical weapon selection including a well done flame thrower
you can jump into most vehicles and use to your advantage almost a mirror of xbox halo
the gameplay is easy and vetern fps will probley have to max out difficulty
killing lots of machinegun armed enemies with a pistol is not very realistic and gets a little boring
aiming is also way too easy
you dont even have to zoom with the sniper rifle as hud indications let you know when theyre in your rangeoverall this game is a good purchase
fans of cc will be very happy
i hope to see more reasonable gameplay in the next version but am satisfied with the purchasemy children ages   and  all enjoy this game
it has decent graphics and lots of challenges
our  year old often needs help to get through the challenges but so do i  we all seem to be able to work together including my husband to get us through the challenges but only one person can play at a timethis game is obviously based on the novel by jk rowling
the person playing the game becomes harry potter and explores d environments by jumping running and climbing
you play games where you win by successfully casting spells or play games like quidditch
there are  characters from the novel with whom you interactthe upside is there is pretty decent play on this game if youre into the books
the downside is the audio is pretty badworth maybe  but probably not more than thatthe first thought i had when i started this game was quotwow
these graphics look just like the moviequot
the castle is very beautiful and everything is just as it should be
the quidditch is very real and i enjoyed how lee jordons commentating matched what i was doingi also really enjoyed the lessons in which you put the spells you had learned into action to receive house points
there were only two drawbacks that i found in the game one i did not have enough time to explore or spend time with ron and hermione and two the game was over before i knew it
so if your looking for a cool game with just a little challenge then this is itits awesome but quite a challenge
i mastered the quidditch part quite quickly much to my surprise
i had watched my friend and it took her ages to get past it
i managed to finish the game i was practically living with my friend fairly quickly and then played it again
definitely buy this even if youre not a harry potter fan because it rockssystem on which this was tried out pentium iii  mhz nvidia tnt  pro  mb ram win with a monitor with  x  resolutionif you dont have at least a smattering of background knowledge about harry potter you may not get much out of this review but in that case why would you be here
the recommendations system here on amazoncom had been recommending this game to me for weeks and i was put off by the box artwork
once i actually looked at a copy of the game with screenshots however i gave it a chance as a loyal reader of the seriesyou play the game as harry
the graphics in the game show you an isometric d viewpoint like diablo or darkstone following harry around but not quite like either one
you can occasionally see harrys face incidentally he turns his head and looks around if left standing for any length of time
the graphics are d polygonal models as in darkstone so that you have freedom of movement you can look up and around as well as moving where you like
the characters appearance matches that of the corresponding actors in the film at least for the adults the texture mapping is good enough for you to recognize richard harris as dumbledore for instance a tradeoff is that of course the characters facial expressions dont change in most cases
the voice acting is ok due to the freedom of movement and freedom to look around control is split between the mouse and keyboard the mouse controls which direction youre looking in while the arrow keys move you around
other keys control spellcasting jumping and so forth
you can configure this in the options menu to your personal taste though
the installer is wellbehaved you may specify not only the drive  directory where the game lives but the group in which the icons are placedthe game opens with the weasley twins calling you aside into a secret corridor for a basic tutorial just before harrys first defense against the dark arts dda lesson
peeves will try to interfere with your progress but even that teaches you useful moves
you can collect bertie botts every flavour beans later if you find the right portraits in the castle you can trade them for cool items eg
a nimbus 
the twins will take the beans from the tutorial but will give you a wizard trading card in exchangesome nice attention to detail the moving suits of armour filch sweeping the corridor outside your first lesson and blocking the way to the forbidden corridor
the castle interior is lovely with vivid colors for carpets coatsofarms and so on the stonework of the castle looks like stone of coursethe only real annoyance for me is that you cant save except when you find specific save points nearly headless nick shows you how to use the first one
it autosaves at section breaks though
this may frustrate you at times
for example you can save just before the flipendo challenge following your first dda lesson where you practice your first spell while solving a jumping puzzle
if you miss one of the jumps and fall into the abyss you cant save partway through the puzzle itll reload automatically from the last save point
you learn a few spells and get a chance to play quidditch once you learn to fly harrys a natural but im not be prepared to practice flying for a bit until you catch onharry potter the boy who lived is out everywhere
it started off as jk rowlings bestseller now a fantastic movie and a computer game
fans of harry potter who are itching to play quittich should not give harry potter amp the sorcerers stone pca miss as it will satisfy them throughly
people who dont usually read the books would also most likely enjoy this game toothis game has the basic storyline which follows to the storyline to that of the book
not much is revealed during the gameplay which is fantastic as people are planning to read the book after playing this game will not encounter any spoilersyou can run the game in hardware or software mode
hardware mode means that the graphics of the game are much better off than that of the software mode which offers choppy graphic
i suppose that this option is there to allow players without a good graphics to enjoy the game tooas this game was designed for children the contols are relatively simple to use
the game is played in a third person view something like tomb raider
players will be controlling the famous mr potter himself
the one of the clever things about this game was that at the very beginning the tutorial of how to play the game is in the form of exploring the castle with fred and george weasely two characters in harry potter
you will learn how to jump and climb and how to move aroundas the game proceeds players can collect trading cards and jelly beans for fun
players will encounter various challenges along the way and in these challenges players must try to win points for their house gyriffndor
players while exploring hogwarts will encounter vaiuous characters that they can interact with giving clues to guide players alongno harry potter game is complete without learning magic spells
parents do not worry here
your child will not be learning actual witchcraft but instead they will learn how to be precise accurate and focus
to learn a spell the teachers of hogwarts will first draw a symbol across the screen at which players with the help of the mouse mmust try to draw as accurately as possible  within the symbol drawn by the teachers  the exact same symbol in a given time frame
it is quite a challenge but quite fun
if the players does it well points will be awarded to the houseanother good thing about the game is that the graphics is drop dead gogerous
hogwarts looks magnificent so did the weird plants of herbology class and the best part of this game
quidditchalas this is a short game which explains the four stars that ive given instead of the five
unlike most games based from movies like pearl harbour and the planet of the apes which were total flops harry potter amp the sorcerers stone pc proves that games based on movies may not always be a total flopa great game to buy for the holidays as present and honestly it is very fun to play
hardcore gamers  gamers of first person shooters action etcetc 
may not enjoy this game unless they want something refreshing to play withlook no further game buyers with harry potter amp the sorcerers stone pc harry potter will once again put some magic into your livesthis game was preaty coolfor its time it had good graphics but now you can find better graphicsother than that this game is a must have if you like harry potter stuffi bought this for my daughter who is  ill try to review it from her perspective im more used to nolf quake halflife etc
the game was played on a ghz p with rage ati  video meg ram x cd playerthe graphics and player motions resemble quake ii in detail and responsiveness
the graphics are generally quite good in some places excellent
the sound effects are consistently good
the character responds well although i would have liked a sidestep key
perspective is good jumping and climbing are not a problemin keeping with the target audience this game is not about blowing things up but rather solving puzzles and avoiding bad guys
noone is ever killed and the worst that happens to you is you faint
i dont know how faithfully the game follows the film or the book but the buildings pupils teachers and even the idea of splitting the school into competitive houses is right out of the old british school system
i seem to remember more teachers like snape thoughsome things i did not like cannot bypass the cut scenes cannot save game at will only at selected locations no offensive spells make the final showdown tedious need some chocolate frogs in the last room many activities such as stars and cards seem to have no purpose too short it only took  hours to completesome things i did like good graphics excellent sound effects cut scenes are short and contain information subtle comedy could have used more likable characters but not preachy very playable imaginative well crafted for its target audiencewas it worth 
not when i can buy halflife for  my daughter will disagree
there arent many good games for  year old girls in this genre and so  is very reasonable
i agree with hermoh vets will be right at home in this the first pc edition of the classic ps game
stepping into the muddy boots of army ranger jimmy patterson its out of boot camp with a great advisory voice over by retired usmc captain dale dye and off to the battlefield
and what a battlefield
jim will be taking part in many daring ww missions embarking in africa and spanning the globe to frostbitten germany
and yup theres that now famous normandy landing to make it through in piecethe graphics are crisp and very realistic if your graphics card is up to the challenge
a downloaded blood patch will add some realistic gore if thats your thingotherwise its just puffs of dust when you rip into those naughty germans with your thompson carbine
the sound is also pretty involving as bullets zip overhead grenades go boom and your squad mates bark orders and scream for medics
in fact its a lot like real war
without the potato peeling in between levelswith lots of varied landscapes to hide behind and a nice and authentic variety of shooty tools to play with youll have a blast on your first play through the gamesadly its a very scripted experience and once youve pegged where that german sniper is youll find him waiting patiently every time you play through
this is particularly true of the riviting omaha beach level
the first time through youll be in veritable shellshock at the detail crammed into the levelfrom staggering out of your higgins boat under intense mg fire to the agonising crawl up the beach as your fellow rangers are blown sky high its a level that will go down in video game history
but make no mistake itll still be the same when you play though the next time
and the next timestill theres a brilliant multiplayer game to duke it out in with lots of diffent levels to suit the junior rocketeers as well as the wily snipers
id certainly give this five stars for the first timethrough single player gameand the multiplayer saves it from being a onehitwonder
add on the shortbutsweet spearhead expansion pack and youve got one fine military crusade
on the ready line soldier time to hit the beachesi hate when companies cave in to whiny left and right wing socialists
but your fellow gamers can come to the rescue
check the various mohaa third party sites and youll find blood and guts patches that will add some realism back to the gameother then the pc drivel this is a great game
the allied ai are dumb but like in any war movie they are expendable extrasthe damage models are a little odd
i doubt that a real german shepard can take even one round from a  acp and keep attacking these dogs must have escaped from one of the labs in wolfenstein the uberdog
one positive point is that the game is challenging but no so difficult that you can to fall back on cheats or walkthrus except for the really hairy omaha beach sectioni bought this game because i have loved the the serires since it came out on playstation
those first two games got anybody who played them hooked
this game is the same way but like the first two has a lot of flawsill start with the good parts and there are a lot of things to like about this game
for starters the graphics are very good and so is the enemy and your friendly soldiers ai
the weapons are all authentic and sound real
almost all the levels are fun to play and have well thought out missionsso whats bad you ask
for one thing the enemie soldiers aim is exceptional they dont even have to aim at you to hit you
for example i ran up a hill along with a friendly soldier and ended up beside a baracade that had a german soldier behind aiming at my partner but every time he pulled the trigger i got hit
the same thing happens around corners through walls and other objects
the enemy also has bolt action rifles that shot as fast as they can pull their triggers
also in one level called sniper town you must find a lost platoon in a town full of snipers dah
doesnt sound bad but on every block of this town there are an overwhelming amount of snipers
every building you look at has two or three snipers in it
if ea was going for realism that definetly isnt it
to have every sniper in the wermant in on town is totally unrealistic and incredibly frustrating
basically what im saying is is you cant beat the game without using cheat codes which doesnt make it any fun
the enemy can also still withstand taking twenty bullets and be fine enough to run a marathon
sometimes your troops fighting beside you can be incredibly dumb for instance standing in the open and getting shot repeatidlythis is a fun game but ea still needs to put a lot more into it to make it realistic and one of the best first person shootersi just got the full version today
this game is phenomenal
the gameplay is well done the graphics are great the missions are incredibly diverse
scripted events pop up everywhere
things go nuts at a moments notice
i have completed the first entire mission in north africa
it was a ton of fun
this game says its a first person shooter when its so much more
theres stealth sabatoge infiltration rescue manning a machine gun on the back of a jeep shooting at a plane thats dropping bombs on youmany games have one thing that takes you so long to figure out that you keep quickloading back to when you mess up
i have not found any such thing yeton easy mode that is and the gameplay is lasting yet linear
you wont find yourself guessing
your mission is laid out right in front of you
many times youll be following someone and theyll take you where you need to go
when you go solo its easy to figure out but that ease does not hinder its fun factor
completing missions is very satisfyingmultiplayer is ok but it doesnt carry the game like in rtcw
no classes only a few maps
worth playing though
but this game really shines in single playernobodys perfect
there are some problems with this game but they are no reason not to buy it
slowdown occurs a lot on machines that barely meet the system requirements
you should have a better system than reccomended to get it running smoothly
running gamespy exclusively for multiplayer is a hassle but is manageable
ai can be weak at times in both your enemies and allies
you do not have the ability to go prone or lean in single player but your enemies do which i think is very unfair
other than that this game is gold
one of the best first person shooters in a while
definitely worth getting
plus the new small box is so cool
its as big as a vhs tape
youll feel curious and happy just holding this games box in your hands
its that goodwhen i read previews of mohaa back in around novemberseptember i was extremely excited for this game to come out
finally
a game that captures the actual dday from first person
mohaas centerpiece is the normandy invasion on omaha beach
however i must say that when i played the dday level finally it was quite dissapointing
the invasion is only small scale and the events are ripped shamelessly from the ww hit movie saving private ryan
the run up the beach is incredibly short and pretty easy
the events are all scripted so that if a soldier is scripted to die he will die automatically in the place where hes supposed to die
this means that theres no possible way to have any variety
you get to the shingle and go to get bangalors like in sprsaving private ryan
you then explode the shingle like in spr and run to the base of one of the giant bunkersabout  guys run over the shingle with you but only you and  others make it because its scripted to have the others die automatically
the captain in your battalion looks almost exactly like tom hanks did in spr
the men at the bunker base with you are the tom hanks captain the sergeant guy from spr who was bald and is bald underneath his helmet
and some random private
captain tells segeant and private to run across to the other bunker the space to it is covered by machine guns just like in spr
they run across and are scripted to get killed so they die
you run across snipe the machine gunners like the sniper did in spr who instantly reappear and run into a trenchnow is where it just turns into an fps game
you go on to take out an entire german bunker by yourself which is incredibly unrealistic
it wouldve been a better level if you could go to the top of the bluffand clear that out but no
the case in the single player mohaa is that the levels lack much depth although it is fun to be in disguise as a german officer and walk around not being shot athehehe the graphics in mohaa are good like in the dday level when youre in the higgins boats the soldiers around you actually look scared mohaas audio and graphics are quite amazing
mohaa couldve used more larger scale battles like the dday invasion except more realistic
mohaas multiplayer i think is the best part about it
it has  or more maps and  or  different types of multiplayer games to play
realistic and all extremely fun to play
maps stalingrad omaha beach destroyed french village etc
etcgames team deathmatch objective based match etc
etcfor what its worthbuy medal of honor allied assault
and buy it now
as quick as you canhehehehehehemedal of honor is a great game u cant stop playing it
u have to keep going on and on believe me i know
but what bugs me is that the company made the game to easy u always have a compas on the topleft of the screen so u always know where to go killing people is fun but it gets boring and easy since u usually kill them with a sniper because otherwise u get killed if u go straight ahead finally mission objectives are not that hard and u easlly get to the point
no thinking etc
despite the fact that the game is easy the game has great graphics and weapons so it doesnt get that boring and u feel that u are living the gamealltogether this game is great
u can also try the hard level since i only had a chance to play normal and have a great time
u definetlly will not be disapointed from this gamemohaa is an excellent world war ii fps
i personally like it better than return to castle wolfenstein just because its so much more realistic
no zombies or whatnot in this one
the graphics could be a bit more refined but still they are very good
i was reading some of the other reviews and i noticed people saying that lines were taken directly out of saving private ryan from the dday scene
this is true
in fact its almost funny how similar the dday part is to the dday part in private ryan
its not just the dialouge either its also the events
you reach the top of the beach blow the shingles go through snipe the germans hiding behind the sandbags sound familiar
i was dissapointed also with the lack of blood
blood and even dismemberment would have made this game so real
it would have put you into world war ii or saving private ryangraphics and gameplay aside the sound is terrific
i loved the effects and just switching weapons was a joy for me i dont know why but i have a thing with sound effects and sound quality
overall this game is an extremely good wwii shooter and if you are into wwii this game is for youmedal of honor  allied assault must be held up to a higher standard than most games
for the original medal of honor on playstation and especially its superlative sequel medal of honor underground had set the bar incredibly high
and though allied assault has some flaws it is overall a really engaging gamefirst lets get the gripes out of the way
id have to say the story elements in the psx medal of honor games were stronger
allied assault still uses real historical situations to ground its levels and that remains as effective as ever but some of the missions are so long and varied that the central goal becomes obscured
reloading takes much much longer than it did before and though you may argue for realism given the oneagainstmany scenarios in this kind of game i think its a bit too punishing
one last problem is that the level design suffers from the same flaws as in medal of honor  sometimes the exit to another part of a level is so obscured that you could end up walking back and forth many times before you find theres actually a door in the wall
finally some parts of the missions like syphon filter are based on previous familiarity  for example i stepped on landmines about two dozen times during the assault on omaha beach but theres no indication of where the mines are so youre relegated to trialanderror  always a bummer
this problem is corrected in a later level the destruction of the nebelswerf rockets where quotminenquot signs clue you innow the good parts  i was hesitant to buy this game because of the prospect of playing with a keyboard and mouse but i picked up the control scheme very quickly
aside from the ability to customize controls way to go
 even the default settings are highly intuitive
the ability to save games saves you countless hours of frustrated replaying especially essential since some of these levels are really really hard
the pacing is tight as a drum and the sound and music work are without peer
the ability to pause the game and go to system menu is simple yet indispensable
and although the size and difficulty of the levels makes for some confusion it also gives you more hours of gameplaynot as good as medal of honor underground quotmike powellquot the lead character here is nowhere near as fun to play or developed as manon batiste but still well worthy of my full recommendationi was hooked on this game shortly after the multiplayer demo came out and have been playing it ever sincethe single player game drops you right in the middle of wwii and allows you to experience some of the most well known battles of the war
each campaign demands different techniques
in some you are storming through bunkers machine gunning everything in sight while another puts you in the middle of a dreary sniperridden village where paranoia reigns supreme
along the way youll work with and be assisted by other troops who are more than willing to put themselves in harms way for you
my only complaint is that the single player game is a bit too short
there were more missions than i was expecting but i wanted morethe multiplayer game is a different beast all together
there is a different set of maps for multiplayer
the games range from freeforall deathmatch to objective based team matches
the multiplayer game is as least as much fun as the single player
the biggest downside here is the use of gamespy
the game has an internal browser for finding network games but youll probably find yourself using gamespy since the internal browse is quite poor
with gamespy youll be subjected to watching ads unless you decide to register it just to find a game to playfinally i just have to say the initial release of this game was terribly buggy
after playing the demo for months with no problems i installed the release version to have it continuously crash on me early in the game
i was stuck with a nonworking game until the patch was finally released
i had similar experiences with f  and black amp white
eas initial releases are clearly beta at best and should be treated as such ie dont expect much until the first patch is out
luckily the patch for moh is out now and most of the problems appear to be resolvedmedal of honor was the best first person shooter on any console ever when it first came out screw goldeneye medal of honor was tons better
i was eagerly awaiting the first pc release
i must admit it is a tad disappointing
theres no blood thats bad thats actually intolerable
  now all i get is him falling over bah
but in all its fun
the dday mission is great a true classic
the rest of the game has some pretty spectacular setpieces
although the combat just seems to be one man vs all which isnt good
i want to feel like im part of the allied force not the allied force itself
but its entertaining from start to finish and the graphics are good
the multiplayer has been unfairly maligned but i was never a counterstrike fan anyway so what do i know
give it a whirlthis is a quality game
it wasnt thrown together in  minutes and shipped out like some of the newer games seem to have been this took time and effortim gonna make this a quick rewiew
first of all i love the unlimited quick saves
these are invaluable in a game
something that is limited of soldier of fortune  that really doesnt make the game any more fun to play the controls are simplethe graphics are top notch and the sound is near the level of ghost recon if not betterthe enemy ai is fine
they come after you and they challenge your forward movementone thing i will sayif your into world war  games it doesnt get any better than this
if your more into the  type war games look towards ghost recon with more advanced weapons and equipment
im more towards the ghost recon end of things myself
both of these look great sound great and have a very good story line to them
medal of honor is a game you wont be disappointed with
good luck and take care
 im running this on a p  ghz and a geforce  ti  i was skeptical of buying mohaa at first but after reading various comments of others and formal reviews i decided to take it on
boy was i glad i didallied assault presents some of the most realistic feeling immersive wartime experiences ever incorporated into a video game
while the game itself is not realistic as far as damage and equipment carrying goes etc the sound graphics missions and locations are incredibly well detailed and produced
the atmosphere is very immersive and the attention to detail regarding s wwii locales is tremendously recreatedthe normandy beach mission straight out of saving private ryan provides one of the most memorable pc gaming moments ever
your mouth will remain open as you dodge explosions watch your men die and fall around you as you approach the beach and run for cover from the german fortificationsthe cut scenes are done ala half life where you are able to control your characters point of view while they are running a very good choicemost importantly mohaa provides a lot of varied missions preventing it from getting monotonous lots of action and intense gun fights and using natural elements as obstacles make for a realistic experience despite the runngun style of the game
at one point i was driving a tank blowing up buildings full of snipers in another i was running through german countryside using tomb stones as cover from a nest of nazis holed up in a bombedout church see the sp demothe game is a bit short in duration but has a significant replayability factor in that you can go back and play on  different difficulty settings and pick and choose which mission you would like to play over again
every time you complete a mission it will be done slightly differently depending on your weapons of choice strategy and ability to shoot accuratelythe multiplayer mode has serious potential but has yet to reach it
the ability to play in coop mode through the single player missions with others would be a great addition to the game and a mod is already available which does just that covering the infamous normandy beach invasion ddaymedal of honor allied assault is certainly one of the best first person shooters ever made and if you enjoy games like no one lives forever youll love allied assault as well an instant classic from ea games and  id software
you will need a pentium iii mhz processor or better and a mb video card of high quality to run the game at respectable rates keep in mind in my opinion
the games requirements are indeed quite high even at lower detail levelsi play a lot of different pc video games rpg adventure sports and fps genres and medal of honor is definitely a game i can recommend without hesistationwell ea certainly got it right with this one
ive got to say ea have had their ups and downs but with the sims franchise and now this
mohaa has been out for some time now but i only just had the honor of getting it for myself and i was not dissapointed
as with all of the other moh games out you play the role of a soldier undercover to start with but basically fighting your way for the survival of the free world and yes it does feel like that sometimesas with all games what one person likes another will hate but this brings with it a mix of brilliant ai so far as ai goes these dayswhere soldiers wont just run at you with guns blazing theyll nearly always find cover and an array of massive and graphically stunning levels to explore
there are  campaigns each with  or  levels to them each aimed at a main objective from the start but having to get from place to place and meet difference people as you do each level in order to complete the objectivefor people who like to see numbers the game took me roughly  weeks to complete on normal mode of  easy normal hard playing a rather limited hour ish a night so it could be said to have a  hour life span
though it should be heavily noted that a lot of that time will be spent reloading and going back to where you started when you last died
it is pretty hard even on normal mode and you will never get bored of playing it at least until you complete it for the second time
the way its design apart from the odd level is that you will have a period of relax where you have to achive something trivial like meet a spy or something accumpanied with the occational enermy attacking you from behind a baral or shed and then youll be on the back of a jeep before you know it with a  machine gun driving towards a german airfield doing nothing but keeping you finger pressed down hard on the trigger in order to survive
its well structured and takes very well after saving privet ryan  actually better put it might as well be called saving privet ryan because its got a lot of influence from the movie such as the normandy beach landing where you will never survive the trek up it first time and the sniper happy ruined village where head shots are a cominoverall if you like a fps with intelligence and tonnes of atmosphere this is one to get
the only flaws that i can find is the pretty average multiplayer mode with only a handful of options and levels to choose from and the occasional glitch like the ai a classic ai glitch which all fps still have not managed to resolve is the panic factor
when you turn a corner to face the barrel of the german rifle in your face you panic and shoot like mad but not the other fella he aims carefully and bam no matter how many holes hes got in his legs and arms he can still once he gets up shoot straight
apart from that trivial thing that had to be put in because nothing else is worth it thats itwell worth owninga word of caution if youre coming from games like halo of other runlikeaheadlesschicken shooters this game may not be for you
to be sure halo was a work of art but mohaa raises the bar to an insanely high levelgameplay i for one was suprised about mohaas rather covertbased feel to most the levels
not that it doesnt have a lot of action because it most certainly does
the omaha beach mission that had everyone drooling will also keep fans of saving private ryan happy for the rest of their lives
the only real flaw here is that the game was rather frusterating at times but its well worth the challenge
the ai is also realistic but has a few moments where it doesnt exactly shine like trying to take on my tiger tank with a submachine gun or an unsuspecting guard totally disregard firing a shot an inch from his headgraphics very pretty
the detailed weapons characters and cool artillery explosions are great so you better have a helluva system
the only problem is a few minor graphical glitches such as a weapon from a fallen foe being stuck on a wall slowly rotating in a circle
also the tank shell explosions seem amazingly small when it hits the ground but is magnificent when you blow apart a buildingsound this is where the game truly stands out
excellent soundtrack realistic gunfire the sounds of incoming artillery and great voice acting seperate this from anything else youve ever heard
try playing omaha beach with the speakers turned upmultiplayer ignore the description of it being average
if you can stand the occasional spawn killing rocket wielding and that one bad map southern france multiplayer is worth itmy advice
buy it plus the expansions being released soonill start with sp over veiwgraphics pretty good
very well scripted faces and emotionsgameplay very fun and very hard
the enemy ai is pretty good but its so heavily scripted that the same thing happens every time
it does lag quite a bit on big levels too
and there is blood
you jsut need to download a blood mod and there you goreplay value ive replayed all of the levels trying to get all of the medals and easter eggswhile the singleplayer is good the multiplay is well poorlevels fun at first but they get too repetive and after awhile boringlag i dont get any except on one map snowy parkfun ugh too many rockets shotguns and snipersover all this game is only average
the singleplayer in rtcw is too short and the monsters are way to hard to kill
while this game takes tactics and different methodes of approach
but the multiplay is much better in rtcwjust a word of warning to those who have systems over a few years old
i have a dell mhz meg ram meg video card nvidia tnt
its a fairly standard highend system as of a few years ago yet even on all the lowest game settings allied assault is nearly unplayable
and no its not a gummed up systemit ran return to wolfenstein just fine
think twice if you have an older system because ea has left you in the dust with this onemedal of honor  allied assault is a fps set in the real world during the second world war and you get to play an american soldier
the multiplayer gameplay is poorly designed but the single player gameplay is excellent with great level design fairly good enemy ai and intresting missions but it has the worst ending ever in a computer game
the dday mission is one of the best levels ever in a fps it makes you feel as if you are really there and it is quite disturbing it alone is worth buying the whole game
mohaa is built on the quake engine i played it on the opengl video mode and it runs great
the graphics and sound are great but the main menu is badly designed and confusing
the load times are not long and the quick loading is almost instant
medal of honor  allied assault is an excellent computer game and not to be missed if you like fpsi have never played the moh series before so i was brand new to the scene when i picked up moh allied assault last week
i was very impressed
medal of honor is a very well made game and is a lot of fun to play
here is a quick rundown of my opinions on the gamegraphics the graphics are very good but i have seen better
namely return to castle wolfenstein the game somtimes can get very dark in some areas and you have to adjust the brightness level accordinglygameplay the gameplay is great
a great weapons system and the gameplay is easy to pick up on quicklystoryline the storyline for the game is awesome as it is modeled after real events of wwii
right down to storming the beaches of normandy which by far is the hardest damn part in the gameoverall overall i think the game is great
it has a few flaws such as a couple graphic glitches but nothing that cant be overlooked
one of the things i liked best about this game is that it has a lot of variety in the types of things you have to do
not just shoot the bad guy
you have to steal battle plans plant explosives disable vehicles and so on
very coolthe only reason i gave this  stars instead of  is because of return to castle wolfenstein
moh is a great game but it just cant hold up to the level that rtcw is at
i would say that this is the second best fps i have ever played
rtcw being the best
both games are great and if youre a fan of fps or wwii games either one is a safe betsystem dell p ghz mb geforcemb videoexperiencerecent plays halflife quakeiiiii deltaforcelandwarrior max payne soldier of fortune rainbow six series mohcurrenti had read some reviews of this game and i purchased it based on the reviews
im not through it all yet
heres my bottom line likes and dislikeslikes sound is spectacular
its one of the best around from the fps ive played
it very well could be the best
graphics and visuals are incredible
facial expressions are very good
somewhat blocky faces up close but less than others ive played
gameplay is outstanding
missions are well thought out and quite varied
you wont get bored with this one quickly
controls are perfect
they are the best layedout controls right out of the box of any fps ive played
just right
nowdislikes  too scripted is right
i hate not being able to do other things in these types of games
you cant even blow apart a box if you like
just what youre supposed to shoot
heck for fun i even enjoy shooting my comrades when im bored but you know what
you cannot do that in this game
not one bit
i hate that type of control over my actions in a game
that is enough to take away one star for sure at least for me
i like freedom
for comparisonthough not wwii i really enjoyed soldier of fortune though yes i know the visuals are about  of moh sof is outstanding
df land warrior is another i can recommend heartily for fun and outstanding multiplayer
one other thing i dont like about this game so far is the lack of even a smattering of blood
i think spieldber should have at least had a bloodoff option as part of the game
overall worth the purchase as long as you understand these slight quirks which are enough for me to deduct one starthis game is good but not what i thought it could be
the options that you are given and the control setup is great the graphics seem to be less than that of return to castle wolfenstein
the gamplay is very quick and you must be aware of everything and i mean everything for example as you are running down the road you may be shooting guys but as you are you then have to turn around or  dogs are going to kill you
the further through the game you go the less help you get
on the level that you are to meet up with a scattered paratrooper division the people you meet up with make you do all the work which in some cases can be quite difficult
if you enjoyed the movie saving private ryan  you will most likely enjoy the middle of the game as you go through meeting up with caracters that you must rescue
all in all if you are interested in war games and dont mind eliminating the enemy this game is for you
i was very impressed with the game return to castle wolfenstein and i would buy it over this game
the difference that made this game more real to me was that the nazis soldiers actually speak german and not talk with a german accent as they do in the return to castle wolfenstein game
but if you want to storm the beaches of normandy go to africa and complete missions that do not have kiddy zombies in them and like straight soldierdog attack warfare i think you will appreciate this gamei am not usually a fan of straight first person shooters preferring games that incorporate some form of realtime action with an overlay of strategy like the close combat series
i find that games like quake which relies on reflexes alone are unrewarding after a while and have little replay abilitymedal of honour  allied assault however is the one first person shooter that is guaranteed to distract strategy hacks from their usual genre 
at least for a whilethe games realistic rendering of scenery and wwii weaponry and its attention to detail are unparallelled
one of my favourite moments is during an early level when you enter a room that turns out to be a toilet and can see the boots of an enemy soldier under the cubicle door
you throw open the door and pistol whip the unsuspecting sentry into submission before hes barely had time to pull his pants upthe presentation of the story line is excellent and there are some truly memorable moments such as when you finally enter one of the german pillboxes overlooking omaha beach
from there you can see the whole scene the tiny figures of the gis scrambling over the sand dunes and barbed wire far below periodically being mown down by machine guns or blown up by shellbursts
then you can turn the mg in the pillbox on german positions to your right and let them taste some of their own medicinethe game nonetheless has several downsides
its biggest fault is that the missions are too linear
unlike delta force in which you can explore an entire three dimensional landscape around each target attacking from whatever angle you choose or picking targets in your own order allied assault forces you generally to follow a narrow path designated by the game
for example when street fighting you are usually forced to conduct full frontal attacks up the mainstreets of the towns rather than being given the option to duck down a side street and try to flank the enemy
this makes the game a little boring and predictable and limits replay abilitythe endings of missions are also heavily scripted finicky and often a bit illogical
in one ending if you stay in the building you will be killed by falling debris
to win you must leave the building and then reenter it
if you follow the correct sequence the building will not collapse on youthe online game is also not particularly interesting  it is very similar to that of the delta force series with a large number of cheats running around and most people opting to use the bazooka or panzerschreck as the lowest common denominator of weaponthese points aside medal of honour  allied assault is a fun game that will keep you playing at least until youve obtained the nine decorations needed to fill your medal boxi purchased this game as well as return to castle wolfenstein and i can say that medal of honor is significantly more fun in single player mode and has very few problems video continuity etc that i thought wolf had
in fact i gave up on wolf before i finished the single player and bought this game
most of the levels are well designed and follow a fairly straight forward storyline
graphics sounds ai are all very well done for the most part
the omaha beach landing level is particularly amazing
i havent played much of the multiplayer yet  initial impressions are positive although not nearly as fastpaced as quake team arenaworld war  is finally made better than it must have seemed
this earns only  and a half stars because of how complicated things get
thats the beauty of this game
it has great graphics realistic lifelike battle scenes and violence
just like that movie black hawk down but it is different
how you may ask
because this was in germany
that was only in africa
the beginning of medal of honor allied assault is almost like youre in africa
shrugs
i dont know
its germany anyway but you wont find hitler anywhere soon
maybe he shot his eye out with his  red ryder shot range model air rifle so you dont have to kill him
oh wellapparently i had already played another awesome medal of honor game before when i thought it was this gamei was right
it doesnt need blood to be a good army game
it just is
the graphics are cool the battle is cool the weapons are cool the projection room you go into to review a mission after youve completed it is coolthe whole game is cool year old fps fan speaking here and you have my word that this is one of the best fps this fan has played ever
the graphics are very good if not sloppy at some timesand the sounds are better than ghost recon
the fact that there is no blood is not a bad thing it just means that more people will play itthe ai acts smart and stupid at the same time the snipers must have auto aim on because they can hit you when you are showing a milimeter of your body
the multiplayer is okit has its moments but it has nothing on wolfenstein but if you compare the single player to wolfenstein there is no comparison medal of honor is the total winneri love the dday missioni download the demo and it was fun and hard even in the easy mode i going to buy the game soon this month and play it onlinei have a emachine processer intel celeron d ghz mb ram and a mb video card and it run great even on medium setting but the load time was long but once you get into the game it will be great no lag at allwow
really a great game
the graphics are good but even at x with medium details the sp game starts to slow down at least it does on my computer p  with  sdram and an nvidia tnt  m
but with a p same or higher ram and a geforce  gts or better this game should be smooth
the only reason i didnt rate it  stars the hard difficulty
on the easy skill setting you should be able to get through the game in about  hours
but bump up to medium and your looking at probably  hours
and on hard well forget it
unless you are an avid fps player you will probably need about  hours to complete it
as probably everyone else is saying the omaha beach map is sweet
the multiplayer version is sort of a let down as the spawn points can start past the fence and two of the mgs from the sp game were removed
a good thing
possiblythis game has an enormus amount of web community so explore the web and find whatever you need for the gamespeaking of multiplayer get into small  playersgames and get your teammates to work with you or for you and you will suddenly find that the homework you were planning on doing will have to wait for study hall that morningif you look at all the potential problems with playing moh aa four years after its release there are some substantial ones
its quite outdated and after playing newer games like pacific asault the call of duties and brothers in arms it certainly looks and feels its age
its also extremely unrealistic wait you mean that level where i have to infiltrate the german subbase blow up the sub and kill  germans on the way out didnt actually happen
the ai are not very smart
there is no flanking counterflanking or anything close to that
the german soldiers have their positions and tasks and never deviate from them
aa is extreeeemley linear one path one destination  million enemy soldiers standing in the wayso why the hell is this game still a blast to playaa is simply classic
it is the first of its kind to depict world war ii combat in a realistic fashion like saving private ryan was to war movies
despite its age the levels are still one hell of a ride to blast your way through
its james bond meets war and the result could not be any sweeter
i usually get bored when its one faceless enemy after another in video games but aa changes up the scenery and mission objectives to keep you on your toes and ramp up the suspense and difficulty factor each time
while i do abhor the infamous sniper level which game makers took a whole bunch of flak over its quite satisfying to finally get through it and i can unpeel my face from the computer screen and sigh in relief
that damn train depot level with the five different machine gun towers still gets my heart pounding wondering when a searchight might spot me
the scope and ferocity of the omaha beach level may never again be replicated by a video game
i have played through that level at least  times just for the sheer thrill of it
the entire battle in the bocage is a fantastic campaign requiring some careful maneuvering and flankingsay what you want about moh aas senior citizen status but it will forever remain a staple in all serious war gamers collections
while the battles may not play out like newer glossier war games all i can say is that allied assault keeps me glued to the screen for hours each time i pop it into my computermoh allied assault is a great st person shooter game and i really was impresssed with it
yet i would advise you to read the following so as to decide wether you want to purchase it or not requires a very fast computer with atleast mb ram mhz and a very very good video card if you want to really experience the charm of the game
different from the ps version
the ps version is way better
moderate graphicsnothing great
similar to the prior moh games
no blood and no gore
takes away the fun of killing the nazis
in conclusion if your computer meets the above listed requirments if you can deal with the moderate graphics and if you can forget blood and gore go get it babyif you like sports youll like this game
if you liked the sims and you like sports youll love this gameim not the biggest sims fan but this game can be played in many different ways
first of all think of it as quotgolf tycoonquot
youre offered a basic golf design system and a budget and away you go
but that isnt all
youll find that you take the role of the course pro and actually play the holes you design
hey it aint links pro but it is funtournaments and pro challenges come after youve started to maintain a club membership base
make some alterations to your course to make it suitable for pro play
or make it easier for non pro golfers
its your course so do what you wantalso you have many different geographical locations to choose from so the replay value is very goodwith all the options and the way to play your course this game will be yet another prize winner from two of pc gamings legends sid meier pirates railroad tycoon civilization and will wright sim city sim tower simshow can you lose with all these factorslinks and other golfrealism fans look elsewhere
this is not about accurate golf
its a money management and resource gathering sim along the lines of theme park or simcoaster
those expecting this to be as involved or detailed as meiers civilization or alpha centauri games will also be disappointed
its not necessarily challenging but still fun to playlike most games of this type you start out with a blank piece of land and a small sum of money and your job is to build up your course hole by hole until you raise enough money to err go on to another blank piece of land
detail is sacrificed for simplicity in this game
you can raiselower terrain add fairway green and various traps rather intuitively but you cant make the sandtrap the exact shape you are looking for
you can win awards for a number of different achievements such as completing dogleg holes or hitting the  and  hole marks
as your course becomes popular and the money starts pouring in you can also sell prime real estate which celebrities such as curtis weird will move intoonce you get a hole or two built you can open your course to the familiar sims who travel the course speaking their gibberish and showing their enthusiasm or disgust at your creation
a well designed course is also necessary to impress the city officials who after a pleasing round of golf will allow you to buy additional parcels of land to expand your course
if your course is particularly well designed a pair of sims will start an elaborate story you can follow along with as they play
a pair may fall in love start a business together or whatever
if the story reaches a conclusion a bonus item usually some kind of course decoration will drop from the sky and on to the course
its interesting to follow but after about four or five stories theyll start to repeat themselvesa weaker aspect of the game is the tournaments you play against fellow sims to build up your skills such as putting driving etc its very basic
you may make a mouse click or two on the initial drive but the computer takes over from there right down to the final putt
you might as well be rolling dice
i wonder why it was ever incorporated into the gameits a very easy game so if youre looking for a challenge straight out of the box skip the normal level and go straight to difficult
theres also a nice feature that allows you to import your face in the game the readmetxt file details how to do it
its tricky but you can import three different faces happy normal mad using a program that edits bmp files such as paint shop or microsofts photo editor
then your face will appear in the giant photo of yourself as you pull up your characters statistics i was hoping my mug would appear in the game itself but alasi killed an entire evening playing this game right out of the box
it sucks you in very quickly with its simplicity
however i dont find myself coming back to it that much the way i did playing the sims
perhaps its because its easy or maybe its just because im sure ive probably seen everything already
so the next chunk of land is a wooded area instead of a tropical beach
whats the use of continuing if youre just going to create another course and listen to the same jabbering sims over and over againstill if you ever wished you create your own pebble beach or mauna kea resort this game deliversi played these game everyday and it is a sid mierers game so how can you complain
it is a fun game
i am leaving this review a few years after i got it so it is kind of old nowin this game you manage your own golf coursecountry club
you manage building your course holes
starting out with a few to eventually you have a  hole course
you can create each hole to your liking with roughs greens sandtraps water fareways and tees
you can add cart paths to connect your holes
also you can add houses to be occupied by celebrities
you can host tournaments to gain additional income for your courseyou wouldnt think this could be all that much fun but it kept me entertained for hours
this truely was a surprise to me
a cure little game like this and it is just as fun as all the highprofile highbudget gamesthere are some shortcomings though
for one the graphics would be much more impressive if there were more zoom levels
there is all kinds of stuff going on and i would like to see these things up closealso i ended up running out of things to do on some of the courses
it would be nice if one could build more than one course on a property
for instance i ended up building an  hole course on a lot that was a bit too small for it really
therefore i ended up building a course that was too short overall for tournements
but once i got more land it was too much of a pain to redo it all
i wish i could have built a second hole course and perhaps even picked individual holes out of both courses to make up an  hole championship coursei also wished id have a bit more influence of the actual definition of a hole
while you are in full control of the actual layout of the hole it is not possible to set whether its a par   or  it does so simply by length of the whole
if you build a very tricky hole however the destination from the tee to the green may be short but it may require to play the long way around
therefore par  clearly isnt right
another issue is that each hole only has one tee
how about womens and champion teesoverall constructing courses and holes is very straightforward
a very worthwhile gameps there are quite a few bugs in the boxed version
nothing too serious
mainly weird graphical effects
make sure to visit the web site for patchesthe fun of this game is that you can make something from zero into a full bloom golf courses and at the same time observe the little golfers shout and murmur in your ground
infact i indeed spent a lot of time wandering on this game
moreover you can play downloaded courses of other designershowever the consistent sound effect and the neverchange picture soonly make this game boring and the lack of strategy makes the game a bit shallowmy intro to golf sims was microsoft golf interesting but not quite my cup of tea
i never did get around to trying maxis simgolf but then sid meiers simgolf came along and i found it quite enjoyable
the sandbox mode is a great way to experiment and see what you can do without having to worry about money etc
the gameplay is very easy to learn as well
my only complaint would be that i wish there was maybe one more zoom level to take you closer to the action but the highest zoon level is not enough to detract from enjoyment of the gamefirst off dont expect simgolf to in anyway represent real golf
its a great game though one i enjoyed for quite some time
there are many different locations you can stage your golf course from the desert to the tree filled mountains
each setting has its own unique flavor and personality
you start off by building rather small simplistic holes then once you earn enough money move up and build more expensive and elegant courses
one thing i dispised is the fact you need to have all of your holes have a really high imagination rating for a respectful sga event to visit town
to make them imaginative you have to make the course very unrealistic then if you have one too many hard shots all the players whine and moan and the fun rating goes down sending that hole to unacceptable for the sga
aside from that which you adjust to its a great game
its really fun to build your course and see it alive with action
as for playing the course yourself that is an overstatement you just click where you want your guy to hit the ball and hope that he hits it okay
overall it a good game but has some flaws they should have worked outthank god im running a geforce ti graphics card with a p  ghz processor and almost mb of ram
this game will eat your computer up if you arent well aboove the requirements in my opinion
if you can handle thisi highly reccomend itcomanche  takes a step away from the complicated often too annoying to learn flight sims that have come out as of lateyou take off with one button and fly with your mouse
it couldnt be easier
choosing your weapon is a mouse click away and firing it is just the samethe game play is pure arcade fun
its not as involved as ghost recon or the rainbow series if you consider the rainbow series to have a good storyline haha right but its just as much funwhen you buy thisknow your getting an arcade style helicopter shooternot a flight sim
one of the simplest yet most fun games out therethis game is a good game with easy controls and interesting missions
it also requires you to make quick decisions that will dictate whether you win or lose
th main problem in the game is that its too easy
for some reason i dont believe that a comanche can take two direct missile hits in the tail and make still be flying
but overall its a good game with interesting missions if you know how to lay them right that require skill and cunninghonestly those who keep giving this game a five are cheating themselves
the truth is if you live in the st century you know that this game has subpar sound only when your units speak and crappy graphics and animations
of course it is a great game
easy management of you empire along with some great music make this a definate keeper for all of you guys who like rts gamesto sum it up if this had graphics that were as good as their seminew game age of mythology it would have been a five
btw you better go buy that
it is awesomeflight simulator  is the best thing to being real
now if the paint on the outside of the airplane would say the real companies like delta southwest united and american that would even betterthe best teacher in pilot traning is in here
there are real time graphics
my favorite is las vegas you can see all of the casinos like luxor mgm grand and the one that you see first from the skies statosphere
there are real time graphics and airplanes which makes it really goodall airports are here even small ones like military bases and cargo fields that have only  a small runways to airports with more than  runways like chicago ohare
they pack all this in one box of  cdsone bad thing about this game is the long load times even when you have a great computer still long load times
but this doest take the fun out of the game
great game but it costs an arm and a leg to buy it i think it is worth itlet me say right off the bat that for anyone who wants a quottruequot flying experience this is the simulator to get
my personal favorite feature is the quotrealismquot settings which effectively lets you adjst a variety of options from quotrealquot to what i call quoteasyquot which means that you can easily get into the air to do some quotsight seeingquoti only have  gripes about this game  the graphics on my machine are not even close to what you see on the box
i have a pentium iii xeon machine mhz with a mb ati allinwonder card the chipset is preradeon
after playing games for a couple of years like need for speed iii i thought fs would look fantastic
however to me the ground looks just like that game quotflightquot from a few years ago except with a few buildings here and there
the fs scenery doesnt look nearly as good as any driving simulator that i have seen in the last  years
sure you can adjust the detail levels but im just saying unless you have a fairly new machine dont expect the eye candy you read about and see on the box
one final note  although the ground looks lousy at low altitudes the buildings really are amazing even on my slow machine  in order to save some hard drive space i chose the quotcustomquot install menu
there were checkboxes for many regions around the world to include in the installation
i left out about half of them
well now every time i turn the game on there is an error message that pops up lecturing me that a certain file and it includes the menu path is not loaded
my point is that if at all possible do the full installation because if you do a quotcustomquot installation you might run into some bugsall amp all this is a really neat game if you are a true aviation enthusiast with a nice assortment of aircraft to fly
i give it  starsmicrosoft flight simulator  although outdated by now is still worth every penny
you can fly to any airport around the world even the tiny onesfrom leguardia to malvern mun small town in arkansas you can fly all over the united states with a borrage of planes
this game lets you experience the landmarks of the usyou can fly as a freestyle mission or you can fly one of the missions microsoft gives you such as circling the colluseum or flying from new york to japanthe only problem with the flights to unknown or small airports is that the graphics and the land under you is all repetitive and dotted with little buildings its all the sameoverviewfun  great for you flight buffsgrahpics  awesome in wellknown places but repetitive onceyou get into the unknowns of the usgameplay  just liek youre a real pilotdifficultyna not really any difficultyoverallthis game is a lot of fun to play if you know what youre doing but if you wamt the real combat experience i reccomend flight simulator battle for europetry this game out thoughyou wake up at the controls of a small airplane
youre engine is already humming but  the plane isnt moving  must be those parking brakes
youre parked at the back of a runway of a small airfield with just one runway
off in the distance a huge dark tower looms piercing the sky
what could just be the start of a steven king novel or an episode of twilight zone is just the latest and prettiest edition of microsoft flight simulator
those whove flown older versions of msfs will know what to expect  better graphics and sound a database of airports and airspace more included aircraft better looking aircraft for those you can addon using rd party files and a customizable editor that allows you to choose where when and how you will go and what color  or f will get you there
fs also continues mss tradition of incorporating features of rd party addon software offered on older versions of fs
fs comes with a speaking interactive atc though others had added atc years ago to go along with all of those verbal lessons fs like fs comes with a speaking flight instructor though the new one seems as prone to getting hungup as the old one
the tweaked graphics engine seems to allow for more realistic texturing of airplanes from the glossy finish of a freshly built mustang to the flat black of an sr and more acceptable realistic movement of animated flightcontrol surfaces flaps and landing gear
in addition to exteriors panels and flight models addon aircraft now have effects contrails afterburner
ground texture is also improved over fs making for much more convincing lowlevel flight
instead of the stiff blue of the water in older versions of fs rivers seas and oceans have waves in fs probably to highlight the inclusion of seaplanesone annoying detail  long load times
this is compounded by the fact that you can only change one aspect of a flight at a time time of day location weather requiring the program to reload the flight each timewhile nothing will rock your socks off in fs its a solid and enjoyable sim that allows itself to be pretty much what the individual user wants it to  from an entrylevel sim to a challenging one
i ran this program smoothly on my p ghz wwinxp  a geforece card
i had planned to hold off on fs since i already had fs but im glad i got it neverthelesswhat about fs
since upgrading my graphics card to a geforce fx pci ive added fs to my system
its a fairly decent performer with better weather generation
however performance on my system required conservative settings making the older fs a pretty strong alternative to the newer gamelooking to have a lot of fun
this might not be the program for you
looking to learn a lot about flying planes
then this program will be a great tool
the graphics in the game are great and the game has every single airport you could want to take off from  from your big city airport to the dirt runway behind your cornfield
a lot of attention to detail was put into the program
the program is a great deal for the money it will cost but if youre looking for a fun game this might not be it but it does have a lot of potential
dont buy this unless you plan on buying a nice joystickms flight simulator  is a very detailed game that lets pc users attempt their skill at flying in a simulated environment
the game platform is a very accurate d model of the entire earths surface and features many many airports all over the planet
my favorite feature is the realworld weather conditions that you can download from the internet
unfortunayely the fog visibility effects looked better of fs   the cloud formations look great on this one though
i just wish they would include more aircraft like a twinturbine cessna or a military jet like f or migdepending on the type of pc you have the performance of this demanding program will probably slow the frame rate down especially when flying over very detailed cities like new york or london with broken clouds and other air traffic
just be sure to check the specs and make sure your pc can handle itfs is a great flight simulator
it has airports from all over the globe including many thirdworld countries
the cities are rendered beautifully and the lighting effects are truetolife
the realworld downloadable weather feature is fairly accurate but the visibility fog effects could use some work
it is possible to crash into other aircraft but you must toggle that setting through the realism settings menu
when the weather is activated and you fly over new york city the game does slow down somewhat
if you are interested in flying simulators this is the one to get
many landmarks especially in the us europe and japan have been included in the program and the us cities as well as london paris rome athens berlin and moscow are accurately modeled
my only problems with the sim are the bad fog and visibility effects and the fact that rivers do not match the bottoms of the valleys in some landscapes
the lake and river glitches from fs  have been fixed however
a very good flight simulator even though its from microsoftevery time microsoft releases a topdollar item with no paper manual included i swear i will never buy the thing
then about a year later i break down and get it anyway even though this is a real sore point with me
that said i have to admit that the lack of a paper manual is the only real problem i can find with this awesome simulator
but gosh it would be nice to be able to reference a bound manual instead of printing it out onto loose sheets or trying to scroll through the adobe thing while youre flying
heck stick a manual in there and charge a couple extra bucksokay with that rant off my chest i shall continue
ive owned every microsoft simulator thats come out since  and each time i get one i wonder if my computer will handle it
im using an athlon  ghz
with  mb pc ram and a geforce mx with  mb video ram
other reviewers have said you can crank up the options all the way and itll still run smooth
thats a stretch unless youve got the latest hardware
but i have to admit i am impressed with how well the sim does perform given all the features theyve added this time
this version has been optimized and puts the  version to shame
on my middling system my optimal video settings are  x  x  with all options cranked to the max
if i increase the resolution any more than that the sim starts to stutter a bit but only ever so slightly
its completely flyable at  x  and it looks gorgeous but the framerate drops noticably
but believe me its still gorgeous at  x  and get this this is the first game or sim ive ever been able to use antialiasing on
and what a difference that makes
youll never want to turn it off once you see it and on my geforce card it didnt hit my framerate much eitherim no pilot but the physics seem good and all the planes do feel quite different from one another
theres a whole slew of commands to learn and while the included tiny booklet covers the basics youll have to reference the stupid manual file for the rest
but rest assured if youre a novice its absolutely easy to get started flying with just the basics
heck im currently using a cheapy gravis blackhawk joystick and its plenty fine for my needs at the momentthe whole world is modeled with the most detail ive ever seen in a flight sim and something like  airports to land at
and you havent had fun until youve taken off and landed in the water with the seaplane
weather effects are great and theyve finally gotten some realistic cloud effects toominor gripe here the detailed cities just dont quite seem as big as they should
las vegas and the pyramids at giza in particular were a bit disappointing
they still looked good just kind of cardboardy
and mount rushmore seemed downright tiny
but overall this is still the best flight sim money can buy and it is worth the price even with no paper manual
this reluctant buyer is satisfied and plans on spending many many hours exploring the worldhaving been recently disappointed by smackdown just bring it i went out and picked up legends of wrestling
after playing it all weekend i came to the conclusion that taking certain aspects of both and combining them into one game would create the ultimate wrestling gamebut having to pick just one for now legends is the bestthe first thing that i saw in the game was the roster which absolutely blew me away
characters include such greats as george quotthe animalquot steele ricky quotthe dragonquot steamboat jimmy quotsuperflyquot snuka terry funk hulk hogan rob van damm sabu the iron shiek rock n roll express ted dibiase mr fuji don muraco bret hart tito santana rick martel the road warriors kerry von erich during one of the betweenbout loading screens a picture of the whole von erich family is shown but im not sure how many of them are playable characters and loads more
those of us who grew up with s wrestling will be in heaven heregameplay has two basic modes exhibition one match and career
exhibition only has four or five different modes as opposed to the something smackdown has and this is the main place where legends loses out to smackdown
career mode is far superior to smackdowns story mode however
in career mode you select a wrestler and start their career working through the various regions of the country to claim the title and move on to the next region
jimmy quotmouth of the southquot hart was my managerlou albano is another manager available in the game managers can also be turned off as can blood and a few other options
you work through various types of matches including man elimination way elimination single amp tag team
the goal is not just to win but to get audience approval and therefore popularity
you need popularity in order to get a title shot
doing things like repetitive actions working a match doing nothing but chops for example will deduct from the match excitement level which is used for determining your popularity increase at the end of the bout
high spots finishers and move variety will increae the excitementcontrols are fairly basic and easy to use
the main drawback to gameplay is that the controls can be a little sluggishthe controls in smackdown while being a bit more complicated tend to respond faster than legendslegends also has a createawrestler feature as does smackdown though its not as comprehensive
several arenas are also available to use in legends though wrestling seems to be restricted to the ringside area no backstage brawling as in smackdown
on a positive note throwing an opponent into the side rail in legends causes them to be hurt unlike smackdown which just stops them and makes them turn around which bugs me to no endin all legends is a solid wrestling title which is tons of fun
if it had the numerous exhibition modes brawling locations createawrestler enhancements and control tweaks of smackdown it would be the ultimate wrestling game for now it is pretty darned close and in my opinion a notch above smackdownwhen i first saw it i had to have it because i grew up on oldschool s and early s wrestling
however the cast of characters and their representation is a bit dissapointing
first i dont think this game is endorsed by the wwf because if you notice the entraces dont feature their theme music which is a huge letdown and also the wrestlers are reffered to without use of their ring names eg
ricky the dragon steamboat or the million dollar man are known only as ricky steamboat and ted dibiase respectivelyin addition a large number of great stars were left out such as shawn michaels big boss man ultimate warrior and macho man randy savage just to name a few
also the match types are pretty limited to basic tag teams oneonones and  man free for allsbut enough bashing this game
it is actually pretty decent if you disregard all the stuff i mentioned above
the gameplay is very solid and the controls are very much reminiscent of the old nes wrestling games that we all love so much
the career mode is outstanding tooin short if you dont expect too much and just want a game that is fun to play pick this one upseveral years ago i picked up a used copy of this at videogame store and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it
to tell the truth id never even seen most of the wrestlers on the game but i still thought it was very cool
the wrestlers did and do look kind of cartoonish but i didnt and dont care about that
the game is a bit slow but that didnt really bother me either
i played it a lot
the part of the game that i enjoyed most was the createalegend mode
this was the first wrestling game that id played where you could actually assign your created wrestlers all of their own moves as opposed to having to give them movesets of existing wrestlers like you had to on another wrestling game or two that id played before this one
i thought it was fun to play as my wrestlers and open up new moves that i could give them
ive got created wrestlers on two three memory cards the maximum number you can have on each of them
i also enjoyed playing the referee and watching the computer wrestle
i only ever opened like one or two of the locked wrestlers and thus never finished the career mode but i never cared that much
this game doesnt seem to be very loved at least not by reviewers at this site but i thought it was one of the best wrestling games id ever played
in fact i still think its one of the best ive ever played even though i havent actually played it in quite a while now
i thought it was about time this game got another good review  and a little more lovemy year old son loves this game which he bought last week for  of the recommended price
this game will work with windows xp home edition but may have to be run in windows compatibility modei thought this game was a great tycoon game
the best in fact
exceptthere is so much you need to micromanage in this game
someone please correct me if im wrong  i might not have figured out how to do it automatically  but you need to set certain cars to each train each time
so if you have a passenger car set to go from washington to baltimore and there is some lumber that can go as well it wont get ship unless you click on it
i prefer rt because it will ship this automatically yet you can still chose what you want to ship if you need to get certain supplies to a factory you own
i just found that to be a little frustrating
but overall its a fun gamei was really disappointed with nhl  so i imediately went out and bought nhl hitz and let me say that this game rocks
i really love simulation style hockey which this game is not but i still miss the days of playing nhl open ice in the arcades for hours
this game has no simulation value but it is so addictive you will have trouble putting down the controller
the graphics are great and the announcer is loads bettert than ea sports feeble attempt
the only gripes i have with it is that i know it is arcade style but come on is it that hard to at least keep track of goals by a player for a game or even season basis
i thought that was kinda weak and also be prepared to play a no defense game
it doesnt exist here
the game is designed that games will be high scoring and when one team amasses a lot of goals it usually compensates by allowing the other team to catch up easier
finally when playing season basd games there is no difference between teams
no matter how good or how bad the players on a team are how good that team is is determined by what order you play them with the first team being easy and the last team the hardest
so technically you could play the red wings first and whoop them but play the thrashers last and they are unbelievably good
this is why i do not give it  stars but it still gets  since ea sports is losing their credibility with me
i am still yearning for a truly great hockey sim to hit shelves for a console unit but until then i have to stick with pc versions and nhl hitz is just good clean wholesome hockey fun arcade stylethis game is pretty cool and it was the first ps game i got it has its flaws the graphics look pretty good but the players faces look stupid i havent played subsequent titles but they look fun ill probably get nhl hitz pro and if the caps knew how to play id be great to bad my favorite team sucks lol lets go capsunlike most remakes of games for the playstation format this one is really a great improvement
its fun and challenging but not too hard for the casual gamer like me
the controls are very easy to adapt to and the car handles like a dream responding to the slightest touch of the stick  but not overcompensating so it takes a perfect touch to keep it on the road
the most aggravating thing about the game is the first stage  the training track
dont think for one minute you can just crank up the car and go blasting through to the finish line in record time and progress
you have to complete the main objective and most of the secondary objectives before you can get to the real missions  but thats good because you have to know how to do all the things in the trainer in the real game
its not too terribly challenging to finish a mission just go for the primary objective and choose a secondary one rather than going for all of them but it is fun
there are still several areas that i have no idea how youre supposed to get to some satcoms are situated in places where your car would have to be able to fly to reach and i just dont see how that can happen but its still a lot of fun
definitely a good investment and definitely worth the moneymidways new remake of spy hunter was for me an entirely unexpected surprise in being that such a classic d hit could be this finely recreated on a  nextgeneration system over ten years after its reigning success on the nes nintendo entertainment system
with such astonishingly fluid speed and responsive controls spy hunter for the ps audaciously soars with  intensely enjoyable multitask stages that direct the player to diversify playing techniques experiment with eachstages impressive interactiveness and excessively integrate the player into its vehicle transforming high octane action and emotionally addictive and cerebrally assimilating gameplaythough it does suffer from slight redundancy no isometric overthe top view a car reverse glitch and an especially short playtime  hours for an average player spy hunter sustains its creative bearings passionate playability and proves unequivocally that great games from the past can be recreated with  authenticity engaging originality and skillrecommended feverishly to any fan of the original gameplaying this game took me back quite a few years since i probably dumped hundreds of quarters in the original
the graphics and play are topnotch and the missions are fun and challenging although at times you begin to feel like you are invincible with the amount of damage you can absorb
i agree with the reviews that say there are not enough levelsyou can beat this game with several hours of dedicated playing
the good news is the game and play is addicting enough that you want to play it straight through to the end
i never lost interest in it like some other games
rent it to try it no matter what but even with the relatively short length it is a great buy if you liked the original
i see a sh in the near futureany regular gamer will agree with me in saying that when it comes to caroriented games the only true motivation factor is upgrading your car winning races lather rinse and repeat
there are so few titles out there that ignore this formula and still sell well
in fact this lies true for blockbuster titles such as gt and nascar  most of the time your play value is progress over fun
you cant tell me youd have more fun driving your beetle  as opposed to an esperante gtr
in other words in most car titles it takes time before you can start having funbut spy hunter is different
spy hunter skips all that sprinter trueno and beetle  boredom and heads straight for the f league
this game is fun fast and insane
period
the interceptor your car can be equipped from a range of weapons varying from machine guns missiles and emp cannons to oil slicks and smoke screens
in other words youre driving a james bondmobile
now who hasnt wanted to do that before
havent you always wanted to play a game where you can spin out a dozen pursuing cars by simply blinding them with a thick smoke and watching them helplessly whirl about as black fluid sprays out of what seemed to be your muffler
yeah you have
how about completely annihilating a road block by means of popping a rack of missiles out of a hidden compartment on your roof then firing away
yeah me too
and in spy hunter thats nothing
thats all just stuff you do on the runoh yeah and the interceptor can turn into a small jetboat type of thing
and oh yeah it has a giant afterburner that pops out of the trunk
nuff said on thatthe only true downside to this game that probably roots from my greed is that its just too darn short
although those missions go by like a herd of snails its over before you know it
dont despair though
theres a ton of extra stuff you can accomplish aside from the missions
twoplayer for example
the twoplayer levels can only be played if youve completed all the objectives on that level in the regular game
even better if you complete a mission within a certain amount of time youll unlock a cheat
in other words theres a lot in this package that keeps you coming back for more
its worth every cent its listed for
dont rent it dont borrow it dont steal it
buy it
buy it nowa pretty interesting game with good graphics and challenging gameplay
a must have for fans of midways gamesits a fun game but way too difficult
its great to see an update to an older game like spyhunter that allows people like myself to relive some of the fun i had with the original as a kid
there are some nice weapons to use as well as seeing that your car can convert into a speedboat and a motorcycle as wellone of the pitfalls of the game is its difficulty
even the training mission caused problems for me at first because i didnt understand what i was supposed to do with certain parts such as the boat sequence
that could have been explained a little better
also the controls are good but i think its not as realistic as something like grand turismo overall its a great game that can be fun but i wouldnt buy it for someone who isnt an expert gameri played a demo of this game and it is greatthis game has great graphicscontrolssound and it is very fun tooyour car can also turn into a boatit is easy and short but it is great while it lastsokay for those of you that think this is supposed to be realistic  its not
it is meant to be fun
that is it
tackle everyone at any time with no penaltieswhat can i say about this game except to say its cool colorful and definitely a blast to play
course froggers always been a blast to play no matter how its played
my friends hate frogger but ive always thought its beena fun and challenging gameid like to recommend this to all gba ownersi remember getting this game when i was   it was the first time i had ever heard of frogger and wow ive been a frogger fan ever since
i didnt even know there was a frogger arcade game for many years afterwardok i think froggers adventures temple of the frog is a great game
it has some good graphics excellent sound and good control
the only reason that it wasnt a star game is because it was too short and if you replay it it gets sooooo boring
but thats why they made froggers adventures  the lost wand
so buy both games for extra action or you can buy the first one for average action
hey its up to you but i recommend getting both gamesgame ratings for temple of the froggraphics sound control gameplay replay overall by my count there are about  or  harvest moon games out there for various systems so natsume must be doing something right
in fact they recently released number  for the gameboy coloron save the homeland the graphics are much improved obviously from any other version on the market
i have been playing it now for just a couple days and i am already hooked
from what i read the game focuses more on interaction with the townspeople than it does making money
i dont really agree with this making money seems to be the primary goal
plus the people that i keep running into on an hourly basis dont have a whole lot to say or do
they are just sort of roaming around and tell you some little cheesy statement about lifei do have one question where in theis the dog foodthis game is vey fun and has awesome graphicsbut i cant say iit is better than the ps version
the flaw with this game is it is very short
i beat it in less than  hours of game play
there are  endings but it would be boring to go throught it over and over
butit was very funbut just too shortwho wouldve thought playing a game where you raise chickens plant crops and milk cows could be so much fun
i certainly had my doubtsmy fiance bought this game for me but wound up playing it when i a major rpg fan decided that the game couldnt possibly be interesting
the strange thing isit isafter watching harvest moon sth for several hours she hasnt let me play yet ive got to say that this is one addictive gamegraphics    not the greatest graphics but it has the typical japanese animestyle graphics with cute dogs and characters with large heads and feet
my only complaint is that you cant really tell mature cows who give m milk from young cows who give s milk but its not a big thingsound   your chickens cluck and make an awful racket
and your cows moo but aside from that the music is upbeat and changes with the seasons
i particularly liked how the cicadas chirped during the summer montha nice touch and it reminded me of when i was living in japan during the summergameplay    okay the only serious downfall to this game is the camera angles and the difficulty to properly position your character to do certain actions
when youre watering your crops  out of  times you will miss watering at least one of your crops a day
the problem with this
your character tires while doing chores so for each missed watering youll have to do it again which means your character will tire faster
plus  seconds game minutes so youll lose precious time too
and then theres the difficulty herding your cows into and out of your barn
going out isnt a problem as time stands still when youre indoors but when its  in the afternoon your cows are outside grazing and its going to rain the next day it gets really frustrating when it takes five game hours to herd in  cowsreplay valuefun   the fun in this is making things work and the monotony of things is actually a good thing
the tedium of doing your chores and trying to get some time in to go fishing sell your food stuffs or talk to people is all part of the game and its even better when you can actually afford to buy a kitchen and make your own food
in terms of replay this game is just like real life in that the game never has to end
you can pick off from where you left off when the game year ends and you can try working for a different ending there are nine in alli love this game for so many reasons and i recommend it for rpg lovers who dont mind doing some repetitive chores and kids as it teaches them the value of hard work friendship and responsibility
and the best part of it all is this is a fun game that doesnt need violence to keep the player satisfiedthis is a weird addition of harvest moon
its kind of weird but it gets away from your farm and to your homelands
there multiple endings for this game but heres my reviewconcept harvest moon on ps  weirdgraphics am i playing dark cloud or harvest moonsound the catchy music makes this one the harvest moon game  with the best scoreplayability easy as pieentertainment enjoyable from begining to end but it feels a little wierdreplay moderatehighalex as i popped harvest moon  save the homeland into my playstation i wonder how the game is going to be
i had never played a harvest moon game before and couldnt wait to try it out
let me tell you not playing harvest moon was definitely wasted yearswhere to start
well my favorite thing about the game is that you take on roleplayer as the owner of a farm you get to choose the name and also your name and animals names
you can buy chickens and cows
to get a horse however you have to work at the brownie farm for quite sometime which is one of the few negative aspectsanother thing i like about harvest moon is that you interact with about oh i dont knowup to  people maybe
harvest moon is full of friendsthe only major bad thing about the game is that you only have a year to play the game
you have to save the homeland from being replaced by a theme park
a good game wasted with this aspectso i hope this review helps you decide to get the game
and take a look at harvest moon another wonderful life special editionwhile the graphics are not very good the gameplay takes over in dues ex the conspiracy a port of the popular pc game
youd be foolish to miss itwarning
do not spend  bucks on this game
the people writing these reviews must of writen them when they just got the game
this game is the most fun ever for only  days
then it gets extremely boringnothing more to say
the graphics are ok this game will satisfy u for about  daysrent this game because u will get sick of it quicklynhl  is a nice incremental revamp of nhl   its fun to play and a solid update but does not represent a major overhaul of the previous edition unlike the significant overhaul of the fifa series for in addition to updated rosters graphics etc a very welcome upgrade is support for dts sound
i was actually unaware that nhl  supported dts  but if your ps is connected to a receiver w dts support the sound is quite improved
everything from the cinematic sequences to game sounds  commentary are enhanced by the multichannel supportother improvements include the usual updated rosters better graphics and inclusion of a cards system a la madden in which completing certain goals  hits in a period highest faceoff percentage etc gives you cards which can provide ingame boosts
some other small details include a revamped emotion meter showing which side has the momentum bug fix for overtime in nhl  one team would have  skaters in overtime where the other had the correct  skaters and further player differentiation in addition to big hitters and big shooters there are now snipers and heroes
one minor complaint is that ea redid the ingame commentary i suppose to be funnier or more edgy but its mostly trite or just plain dumb if you dont like dennis miller on mon night football i guarantee you will not enjoy the new nhl  commentaryoverall a solid new version nhl
if you already have nhl  but youre only an occasional player then id say wait till next year to upgrade
but if you dont own nhl  or you love eas nhl series then nhl  is certainly well worth the moneynhl  for the sony playstation  is a decent hockey game with some good points bad points and a few completly terrible pointsthe good its hockey i seem to say that every year but hockey is a great sport
this game has great graphics and options dynastyfranchise mode for example
ai is much improved in the goalies from last season
goalies are much more consistant this year as scoring is a bit more difficult and realistic on the medium and difficult modes
also the game plays truetolife when it comes to your strategy
if you go allout to constantly make openice hits or dont dump the puck into the offensive zone while changing lines theres a great chance youll give up oddman rushes that can very well lead to a lot of goals againstthe bad the sound has hurt this game more than anything
the playbyplay and color comentating are the worst ive ever heard
this is hockeya full contact game where the weak get crushed and pounded and fighting gets you five minutes rather than five games
the developers at ea have decided to take a physical sport and turn it into some kind of comical relief type of atmosphere that doesnt work at all
checks sound like explosions and slap shots sound like rockets
ea needs to hire a new sound team as each season their sound effects keep getting worse
the music even has the comical bare naked ladies group for their music choice
and wheres the organ music seldom heard and national anthems
also some added replay features are put into the game to stop the action while some stupid replay of a big save or big hit is shown three times this can be turned off thoughwhich makes this a waste of programming and dics space
breakaways are put into widescreen mode to quotaddquot to the excitement or whatever of one of the most exciting moments of the game
well it does take getting used to but this feature is not wanted in a hockey simthe ugly fighting looks much better this year but its still a nonskilled buttonmashing contest
no ducking or grabbingjust fistacuffs thrown for about three seconds
the fighting in eas nhl  for the sega genesis was much better than this garbage remember pulling your opponents jersey over their head throwing them down to the ice and continue to beat him while theyre downahhh the good days of real hockey programmingmark lesser where are you
id love to see that go from bit to what we have today on the psxnot this buttonmashing garbagethis is not a bad title by any means
when you get used to the controls and aweful color comentary youll see that this is an addictive game as there is a lot of simutation and realism involved
simply adjust the options to your liking and to eliminate to annoying garbage and youll have a great sim on your psx
is it better that nhl 
in most areas yes
its not the addons that make it better with the exception of the franchise mode its the better gameplay mainly the goalie ai that makes it betterexcellent game play and player control makes nhl  an excellent game to own
the break away cam great hit cam and excellent game cam make nhl  a visually entertaining game with many hours of fununfortunately nhl  does not have franchising available saving a season takes half of a memory card and i have not found out if possible how to save only a profile and not a seasonall in all this is an excellent game with excellent features added to improve over the previous versionthis a great game for fans of harry potter that dont want the magic of the book or film to end
the game really makes you feel as if youve entered harrys magical world by closely following the story of the book and film
the experience is like actually quotbeingquot harry potter in the sorcerers stone
the colors are bright the game areas and characters are large and the tasks are varried
you get to do everything from talking to characters learning magical spells to secretly exploring the castle and collecting magic cards
and of course you get to play quidditch
the quidditch match is a bit hard to navigate at fist but you soon get the hange of it and wiz along like a proanyone from  on up can get enjoyment out of this game
the challegnge level increases somewhat as you progress so even experienced gamers will get into the fun
but really its all about hp fans getting a taste of the wizzarding world and in that it suceeds in spadesim not a huge harry potter fan but this game should be an interesting one to watch
it should sell out very quickly to kids so reserve yours todaythe game is based on the hit book series by jk rowling
in the gba game you must survive the first year at hogwarts
this game is made electronic arts game
you play the role of harry potter exploring hogwarts in his first year as a student wizard
you must enter classes with neville longbottom hermione granger and ron weasly and master  skills that are used in the book
you must also overcome challenges that come each term such as looking for hagrids lost pets or finding the sorcerers stone itselfit should be a hit among kids and will sell out very quickly
ea sure knows how to make a lot of money
there is also a gbc counterpart to this gba game which should also sell welli compare this game to old game boy games and im amazed
game play is fair but over all the game is good and engrossing
however im a sucker for game boy games my wife who is much more discriminating loves the game more than i dothis game is best for skilled gamers ages  because there are some hard levels and tasks
the graphics are ok
because it is an old game and that must go into consideration before you purchase iti bought this game as part of my ps game shopping spree
i was a bit nervous when i started to play the game because i was afraid how it would turn outit was great
i really loved how the developers added stuff there that arent in the book eg
flipendothe good you can collect different coloured beans for special prizes yellow blue green and redgreat hidden challenges to win cardsvery kidfriendlythe bad sometimes it can get a bit repetitiveif you fail to collect all  cards at the end of the game you cant come back to collect them
fixed in next harry potterlack of save pointsmany games based on movies are just bad
for example the game of tarzan for psx stunk big time or the emperors new groove or the fifth element
when i heard of harry potter coming out for the psx i tought it was going to be as bad as any game based on a movie
i was a bit wrong
this game is very funwhile it lasts
check out the good and bad things about it belowthe good thingssomethings are based on the bookthe characters are just the same as in the moviehogwarts is huge there is plenty to exploreyou assist all classes including the quidditch practiceyou fight against voldermort and quirellthe magic spells are amazing incendio alohamora wigardium leviosa etcthe bad thingsthere are too many things that are not in the bookharry potter doesnt talkthe conversations between characters are brieflythe battle against voldemort is quite patheticthe end is very badmany things are briefly described by the narrator in a bookthe forbidden forest is not scaryvoldemort appears frequently using a green magicall the magic used by harry is basically following the order of bottoms
example press x then o and finally x again very simplevery short and easyoverall the game is a worth buying game for any harry potter fanthis should be a popular game among not only kids but adults too as it has great graphics
it will have several weapons and maps for players to use
the game is set in the future and will support  player multiplayer games with many different modes
this is yet another game that is made by majescowas looking for a fps for my new gbasp and was given this
very doomlike but what is missing is some music
also the enemies dont pursue you like they do in doom but either way it is a great little game
not bad graphics either and pretty good texture for a handneldi just bought this game today and i have to tell you im pretty impressedits got amazing graphics for a handheldi did however i did find a few flaws that did disapoint methe sound effects of the guns are pretty weak and this doesnt apply to everyone but this game lacks gorethis game is awesome and really not that violent so if you want a first person shooter that is not to violent this is the one for youover all i loved this game but i think i prefer doom due to the goredark arena is a fantastic game
i wanted a first person shooter that didnt require tons of thinking and puzzle solving
i just wanted something to relax with and have some fun with after a long day at work
this game accomplishes that
it has suprisingly crisp and colorful graphics
for those people that said the graphics stink i think their expectations are too high
this is not on an xbox or ngc
its on a gba with a tiny screen
i feel that the enemies have great looks to them and the weapons are fun and creative
the only reason that i have not given this game  stars is because there is not music during the game and i dont like writing down passwords
i wish it had a built in quotsavequot feature
other than that this game is awesome
all video games do not have to be extremely complex and difficult in order to be fun
lots of games now are way too complexso complex in fact that they arent any fun if you just want to sit down and play for a little bit because it takes too much time and effort to get into them
dont get me wrong i like many of those games too but thats not what this games about
purchase this game if you want a fun medium involved stress relieving gameif youve heard of soldier of fortune then like most people you probably heard of its notorious reputation
at the time it was released soldier of fortune was arguabley the most graphic violent game on the market
while it lacked any vulgarity the realistic depiction of gore really pushed the envelope  it even got condemned as pornography due to violence not nudity by the canadian governmentthis is how i first became curious about the game and my first time playing it i was pretty shocked  in a pleasant way
the game uses technology called the ghoul engine which drives the games graphical gore fest
this system allows for all sorts of realistic damage to be done to objects and characters in the game
nasty looking bullet holes complete with powder burns apear where you shoot a bad guy
blood is plentiful in the game
and of course shoot someone enough times at a joint or with a high caliber weapon and you will dismember them
this is actually pretty fun though somewhat disturbing
shooting someone in the stomache with a shotgun will even cause intestines to spill out and shooting someone in the face causes a really nasty messwhile the over the top gore is the main feature of the game but otherwise the graphics look pretty good considering the year the game was made
nothing too spectacular but based on the quake  engine the game looks pretty good
aside from dead bodies with missing legs and pieces of shattered bone potruding froom the stumps the game has lots of other little graphical details
bullet holes are different sizes for different weapons and are different based on the type of surface you fire at
sound too is pretty good and bullets hitting metal not only made nice looking bullet holes but also sound pretty intensebesides these features the game is a little lacking in plot but then again thats probably not why youre playing this game
the gameplay is a heck of a lot of fun and as long as youre old enough to handle it the gore is just a nice little commodity
the problem is the game doesnt feel very serious although it tries to
the story gets pretty stupid towards the end as the end of the game is a boss fight with a bad guy who looks like a reject from the gi joe cartoonsalso the realism found in the graphics is no where in the rest of the game
the selection of weapons is lacking and the weapons are fake made up weapons that are only loosely based on real military arms at best
some of the late game weapons are just plain stupid
they would have been better of staying with a gritty military persona for the gamethe gameplay is good and if you want to see lots of blood and guts youll love this game
but you may be disapointed that the rest of the game lacks character and realismya gotta lot it
pure unadulterated violence
my kinda game
yeah the graphics are way outdated but the manner in which you can blast body parts off of your enemies is fantastic
i cant get enough of the dismemberment as they scream with their last breaths while being separated limb by limb with hot smoldering shotgun rounds
the save anywhere feature is a blessing
overall i enjoyed this prehistoric game
i had to cheat to beat the final boss but besides that the difficulty level was just right
oh yeah stay away from no one lives forever
that game wreakslet me start by saying that in all of my reviews of video games i dont concern myself with graphics sound and story as much as some do
what matters to me the most is game play and whether the game is fun or frustrating
this game is a very good game and a lot of fun to play which just happens to have outstanding graphics sound and an interesting storyvoyager elite force is a fps based on the star trekvoyager universe featuring the voice talents of all the cast members of the tv show except for kes
as a member of voyagers hazard team you will embark on several missions on voyager and various alien ships including a borg cube
you will encounter a variety of aliens and alien weapons but the game is not just a shooter it involves some thoughtful puzzle solving
the game has varying degrees of difficulty so that you can adjust the game play to your skill level
one of the big pluses for this game is the save at any point feature that allows you to move the game along and not have to replay some of the longer more tedious segmentsthe game has a few negative points
for one thing its pretty easy to run out ammunition and you find yourself often second guessing what weapon to use
when fighting alongside team members they often get in your way more than they help
the most annoying thing however were the long cutscenes
also some portions of the voyager based missions are frankly pretty boring and seem to be there just to take up time
and the load times are horrendoushowever even with these annoyances this is still a good solid game
voyager fans will love it but i think anyone who enjoys fpss will have a great time with the game
this title has become my favorite game for the ps great game but its not tales of destiny  this is better known as tales of eternia as the psp remake was called nothing to do w tales of destiny completely difftales of desinty  is on ps and only ntscj jap release heres the real tod this is tales of desinty ii aka tales of eternia get it right ppl might want to change the title its seriously false advertising the first of tales series tales of phantasia was such revolutionary rpg for snessfc it was pity not to make in us
when they introduced the second series tales of destiny with slightly tweaked phantasia engine there were no doubt that turned many gamersthis time they got it right well mostly
i still cant forgive some bonehead at namco for changing name from eternia to destiny ii but otherwise this is fine rpggraphic has been improved to bit level without losing its uniqueness
with bit of bit simpleness it distinguishes from othersbattle system is where this game shines
improving its trademark single plane full time no timebar battle system battle is more enjoyable than other rpgs
while others might dismis this as simple button masher it is not
it takes great reflex of d fighting game and bit of strategy before the battle to maximize effectiveness
for instance assigning characters battle position their battle method and attack point increases your survivalalso it doesnt hurt to point out that the first tales was developed by wolf team from namco which later defected to become triace yes the creator of star ocean series
it explains the similaritiesweakest part of this game is music score
they do their job but also very forgetable
ive played more than  rpgs including every final fantasy series star oceans chronos lunar grandias persona  manas sagas phantasy stars but this is the only time i couldnt remember any tune while playingif you can find one i got lucky at local store you should give it a try
however if you are not rpg fan i wouldnt recommend iti dont know if the game was good or not scince i got it for my step sister but she to enjoy it and she cant play video games that welli was hoping this game would be for psbut it wasntwhy the helk did they make this for game boy advancecrash bandicoot the wrath of cortex and jak and daxter were much much betterthis game is okay but this is not a must havemy friend jake helps me on this gamehe says these games are funkyspyro is much much better than spyrothe levels in this game are too hard for mereally even the sparx levelsthere are only mini bosses in this gamein some of the sparx levels you have to beat a gaint bee a grass hopper and some other bad bugsnext year they are going to make spyro for playstationi bet you want to know gendor looks likehes real head is red and half of his bellyhis other half is greenany way guess whos back
money bagsbut this time you only pay him for sparx levelswell this game is okay but next time dont ever ever ever ever make spyro or crash for game goy advance againmy daughter loves this game
the game boy advance is to small for my eyes to see therefore the game and the system is good  for a younger person
thank younot the best game ive played but not the worst
as the other spyro games it has many levels and challenges and takes a lot of patienceokwasnt what i was expectingbut i bought it any howits ok and has a good story linei love the music to itits pretty good music at leastthe graphics are good but not perfectyou can finally be coco at least on the places that do with hong kongshe loves hong kongcrash is the main charter and does pretty well of it tooi like the elementalsthese are face masks that control a certent elementsince im telling you a lot i might as well tell you what it is aboutit all starts with drcortex making a planhe decides to awaken the elementalswhich now crash and coco must find a some of  purple crystals and beat crunchanother bandicootto send the face masks back to where they came fromthe elementals will be listed belowrokkomask of earthwawamask of waterlolomask of windpyromask of fireyou get a set of different vehicles which include the following belowfireflygliderspace fightercopterpakjeepcocos scootersnowboardsubandmechtheyre all pretty cool looking and they all have good qualifacationsbut most of them are not fastat allbut this is depending on your disionso if you like games like this you should buy itbut i warn you if youre not patient you shouldnt buy itit takes a minute to load and sometimes longerand most of the time its hard to figure out how to make it save and loadif youre not sure heres a tipgo up to the save load thing until you cant go any furtherdont jump or youll mess things upso once your there press x then you can save and load
hope im helpfulcrash bandicoot is a fun game
ive been playing it since the original one first came out
with the latest release the graphics and sound are amazing
the only downside to this game is the loading time
but its still worth owningthis isnt the same old crash
what is konami doing with crash
im very sad to rate a crash bandicoot game  stars but i would rate it  it isnt the same controllers but if you are a big fan of crash like me you would notice the differences
only buy it if you are a big fan of crashim very disapointed with the transfer of crash to konamithis game was very fun and addicting but the problem was that the loading screen seemed like it took forever
this was a very good sequel for the crash series i am not the hardcore vid game player but this was cooli loved all the other great crash bandicoot games and got this one and wanted my money back
the lowding takes forever the bosses are extremly hard the graphics are still ok
but this game doesnt have the sprake of ecsitement the other  hadi have been following the crash bandicoot trilogy since the very first game on the first playstation
most of the games are pretty good and fun
crash bandicoot the wrath of cortex was one of the best of the crash games for sure
there arent many changes in this game from the previousadventure games of crash except better graphics moves and a way better storyline
this game and crash bandicoot  warped are the  best games of crash bandicoot neck and neck
crash bandicoot  cortex strikes back is the nd best of the games and then after that is the rd best game crash bandicoot the very first one
crash team racing was okay for a racing game but crash bash was definitely the worst of them all
the only major complaint i have about this game is the loading time
i mean damn what was up with that
it literally took like a minute and a half for that game to load up every time you beat leave or quit from a level
it made the loading time for medal of honor seem short in comparisonstill the game is very cool and what i definitely love most about it is when crash bandicoot gets to pilot those two mechs the red fireproof one with the water cannon and the yellow one with the fruit cannonwhen i heard that crash bandicoot gets to pilot a giant mech i was overjoyed but that changed a little bit when i saw just how gigantic the mech really was
i was hoping i would be like the size of those big mechs from gundam wing or something but either way the mech is really cool
also that thing with crunch the superbandicoot merging with the elementals to become more powerful was really cool
i would of given this game  and a half stars if i couldmostly because of the loading time but instead i gave it  stars since its too good to be given a  plus i love crash too much to put him down like thatyes crash is back and is kicking behind with new gadgets
thestory dosent continue from the other crash games its like none of that stuff has happened and cortex is just starting to fight crash
the reason for that would probably be because naughty dog didnt work on this one
the graphics arent as good as they could have been
besides all that it is still a fun game to playthis is a pretty fun game
it was the playstation standard yknow
i really wish i could love this game
i really wanted to love this game
but i want something more
ive been playing sly cooper and ratchet amp clank and have been spoiled
those games push the envelopethe vehicles are cool thoughthis game have a good story linethe graphic is goodthe sound and music are goodthe game play is the same from the other game for the playstation versionthis crash game is very fun and give some time a good challengecrash is back once again
i have been a big fan of crash since the first crash way back in  or whenever it was
what is with the loading time
the time it takes to load in between levels is unbelievable in the time it takes to load you can hit the bathroom and make a sandwich
besides that the latest installment of crash is a continuing improvement from one to the next
these games including crash team racing are a blast to play and if you are a fan of any of the crash series games you will love this one too
why wait go pick it upcrash bandicoot the wrath of cortex is a ok game
the only reason im not giving it  or  stars is because it takes very long to load
by the time it loads i dont feel like playing it any more
i cant even get past the  level
its hard fustrating and kind of boring
if you are a real crash bandicoot fan you might like iti cant help but wonder if the developers remembered that they were designing a game for the ps and not the ps
for better or for worse this crash for the most part looks just like every other crash
but as for the gameits really cool  the graphics are outstanding but for the most part they always have been even on the old ps and for coco fans its nice to be able to do more than walk in a straight line and jump with her characterthere are a number of worlds  for most getting the purple crystal is easy i finished about  of them in the first  hours i played
the bonus areas where you go for boxes and extra lives have gotten way harder which is nice
takes a bit of strategy and timing whereas with the older games it was just an easy way to get extra lives
depends on how you look at it i guess but i see this as an improvementhavent started doing any of the time trials but i can only imagine theyre going to be tougher than previous crash gamesas for variations between naughty dog and the new developer
if there hadnt been such a big deal about the changing of companies i never would have known any different
this crash looks exactly like the older ones but with better graphics save for the intro movie sceneif you love crash get iti played the first four levels of this game on a rental thank goodness  at least i didnt buy it and i spent more time watching the loading screen than actually playing
at least thats how it felti agree with the other reviewer who said hes a big fan of crash and it was hard giving the bandicoot only two stars
other than the horrendous load times the game is pretty good  the level design is innovative the graphics are nice and crash coco and dr cortex are all in fine form
but the load times ruined it for methis was the first game i ever played on my brandnew ps just bought today
i hope ps games dont usually have such obnoxious load timessince everyone here has already griped about the long load times for the game which are annoying by the way i will focus my review on the actual game
the game is great for ps crash looks sharper than ever on the ps
but is it really worth it if you havent played the regular playstation versions
the answer is probably not
its still running straight forward or vice versa and the levels are richly textured and have alot of fun things to do in them
but since all of the crashes for the psx go for less than  bux now i suggest saving your money and playing them first
they are just as good not graphics wise but gameplay and level wise
yet if you are a fan of the series this is not one to be missed
if you want a platformer for your ps jak and daxter is the obvious superior choice theres no comparison but if you need another one this game is actually pretty goodfirst off i wouldve given the game  stars if loading times werent awful
but they are
you will wait before and after levels possibly  seconds
it doesnt sound much but when you are just sitting there it is
if you have a yrold i highly recommend passing on this one
instead go with crash bandicoot warped for playstation works on ps if you didnt knowbeyond the awful loading times it is the same crash bandicoot
cortex is back yet again and this time he is trying to get rid of crash for good yeah right
same basic cast of characters including cortex akuaku n gin crash coco ukauka etcthe first thing you have to do is get all  crystals sounds familiar
every five levels will have a boss sounds familiar
after beating the last boss youll need to get all the relics sounds familiar
and gems sounds familiar
and of course there are secret levels
well you get the picturein fact the game is so alike warped that they have the same sound effects ie
the little chime when you get the crystal
however the musical score is noticeably lacking with no real beat like the previous crash
this isnt an obvious shortcoming but experienced gamers will notice
graphically it looks a little different
crash seems more awkward and bulky which takes some getting used to
i didnt notice a huge graphic improvement over the previous game
in fact i like some of the graphics in the previous game betternow you have to decide if the same exact thing as the previous crash is a good thing
i think it is being a huge fan of crash bandicoot warped
think of it as an expansion pack to the previous crash
i enjoyed it and it is a must have for crash bandicoot warped fans
no questions about it
in fact if you havent gotted crash bandicoot warped already it is a bargain now and grab it
in fact buy bothhellocrash bandicoot wrath of cortex is the  crash game and is available for ps xbox and gamecube for the first time everits not that good as crash bandicoot  and warped but still it is goodi have this game for both gamecube and psthe only problem with this game is the loading time come on it takes  minutes  load a level or youre load gameanother thing is that
its allways the same boss crunchanyways i say that rent the game first and think twise before buying the gamethis game has awesome graphics but could have been more entertaining
if you get aggrivated easy id probably rent it first
it is a really fun game though
id recommend it to other crash fans
if you have never played any crash bandicoot games id recommend the rd one warpeda game with mediocre graphics simple gameplay and long load times isnt very exciting
an that is exactly what this is
obviously sony saw this as well and sold crash to konami who produced it on xbox and gamecubethis is one of the truly best games for the system
it is a lot of fun to slash and hack at monsters in a game and this one is just about the top of the heap when it comes to this
also appreciated are the amazing visuals excellent character control and decent storyline
best of all for me was the fact that the game is not too frustrating
easy mode is fun to play through and doesnt have too many of the wandering around wondering what to do next moments of resident evil
after you finish this mode you can go back and go through in hard mode with ramped up monsters etc
overall it is a fast paced thrill ride definitely worth your dollars or at least an extended rental
a word of caution it is a very violent game so it is not for everyone
still for those mature enough to not be scarred by a story about a half manhalf demon this game will hit the spot
it is a single player adventurethis is perhaps one of the best beatemups that the ps has to offer
in some ways thats saying a lot the controls are responsive and decently tailored to the environments the combos are relatively interesting and there is decent weapon variety and not that muchhonestly this game is all about hack and slash and kill the monsters it doesnt pretend to be otherwise
there is little plot to speak of but the monsters have interesting designs and the attacks based on what weapons you have equipped are quite amusingwhere dmc really falls down is the camera
i was tearing out my hair most of the time because even though a camera angle may be good for being cinematic it probably stinks for gameplay
that and some overly annoying bossbattles and supremely difficult quotsecret missionsquot make it a bit less than perfectdont get me wrong though its still wonderful if all you want is some good ol fashioned carnage on the pswhile i enjoyed this game for the short time i played it it is not the masterpiece that many think it isthe prosthe gameplay and graphics are superb
plus the main character dante sets off an aura of coolness not seen in video games in a long time
dante just stands out as an important characterthe consthe gameplay gets old
there are no puzzles in this game like some people are stating
you see a statue and it says it looks like there are three holes to put something
then you go to the next door and there is a giant glowing item on a pedestal
you examine it and it is a trident
i hardly call that puzzple solvingalso the enemies get very tedious and repetitive
you fight the same enemies in every mission and they respawn when you reenter rooms which really stinks
and whats with fighting the same  bosses  times eachand finally the game is just way too short
i beat the game in around  hours my first play through without a guide or anything
 hoursgood thing i didnt pay the full price of a new gameall in all this game was pretty enjoyable in its  hours of gameplay but i liked this game not loved itstill for the low price this game can be got for you cant go wrong
there are worse games out there than devil may cry out of the visuals and the atmosphere of this game are unbeatable
but i cant express how difficult some of the bosses are possibly due to the camera angles that you have no control over
the sword  gun combo is freaking cool and the story line rocks but againthe bosses are hard
this is another game that i would recommend buying extra controllers for if you are the kind of gamer that takes frustration out on controllers
either way id recommend the game simply for the experience and good time youll have regardless of the ridiculously hard time youll have with some of the bosses
oh and when you die from a boss they restart you way back on the level which adds to the frustration of the bossesdevil may cry is a true gem in the ps library and deserves to be playedthe good beautiful graphics and sound incredibly fun battle system challenging levels mission based gameplay multiple weapons able to purchase skills slick controls cool characters unique bosses and puzzles secret unlockable bonusesthe bad really short not a whole lot of replay value annoying underwater levels predictable storyline really only worth a rental some bad camera anglesdevil may cry is a phenomenal action game but its hurt by its short length and lack of replay value multiple endings definitely couldve helped
a must rent and must play for ps ownersdevil may cry was truly fantastic
this is definitely the best action game ive ever played it even has more action than the metal gear solid games
dante is really coola hell of a lot cooler than raiden and trish is quite the stunning demoness
this game is like a complete upgrade of the resident evil games with better controls weapons graphics enemies etc
the only thing that the game doesnt have enough of is a story
that takes away one star from its score
if it had more cutscenes and a better story then the game would have been perfect it would of even surpassed the metal gear solid games
stories are very important to me in video games without at least a decent story the game will always have one star or half of a star taken away
actually this game deserves  and a half stars cause its just so damn cool
if you like those games like resident evil tomb raider or onimushawarlords then youll love this gametrust me
ive never beaten any resident evil games or the tomb raider or onimusha ones but i know those games are similar to devil may cry
i cant wait until the sequel comes out hopefully they will make a sequel
please capcom make a sequel to this game its a true successthis game is a little like resident evil except has more to do with the underworld than a virus
anyway its still a great game the controls are a little easier then the resident evil games
the graphics are good of course and its pretty fun there is also this setting at a certain part of the game where it asks you if you would like to set the game to easy auto
you only have one chancer to make the selection
easy auto pretty much makes the game easier and all your weapons will be automaticthe lastest game from capcom is devil may cry
this game is one of the coolest action games you will ever play
to start with the lead character dante is the coolest protagonist on digital media
he is like claire redfield lara croft and simon belmont all rolled into one
his movement are the best ever in an action game
he can leap roll run walk and bounce off the wallls like a crazy bancheedantes weapons are cool too
he has dual automatic pistols as well as a huge freaking sword
he can use any of them with lighting fast speed and surgical precision
the combos you can link with these two weapons are pretty much limitlessthe graphics are simply stunning
the game uses a fixed camera view so it  a lot like resident evil
the castles are gothic style architecture and the game is like what a nextgeneration castlevania should bemy only complaint is that the world is so beautiful and you are stuck exploring it through a missionstlye interface instead of a free flowing free exploration interface
i wished the game was set up with a central hub like soul reaverall in all however the game is quite stunning
it is a lot like oniumusha but your character is a lot cooler
it is the first time in a fixed camera game that i know of that the character can move and attack at the same time
this is very sweet
resident evil should incorporate this action into their series
you also have a lot more manueverability than in onimusha or resident evil
anyone who loves action should pick up devil may crythis is a capcom game about guns swords walking around and generally kicking some toshie
easy to play fun to play heres a general ideagenre d action game one person
you walk around and kill thingspuzzles easy the level puzzles are simple find key use key
the bosses pose some challenge in finding tactics that work against them
other than that the puzzles pose no challenge what so everviolence high thats all this game is about killing things
none of these things are human the closest human resemblance are puppets marionettes
others include insects shadow dogs lizard warriors wraiths
there is blood but not excessivehighs  variety of armament point bought skills varying levels of difficulty funlows simple really simple
story basically is no good the spoken dialect is embarrassing to listen to some real problems with regard to realismalright so its capcom makers of resident evil and mega man so what do we have
a slight combination
remember onimusha
well these are the same guys
resident evil meet mega man  introducing devil may cry
its got the look of resident evil in a d world but the action style of mega man
very very similar to onimusha
alright if you have played any of the previously mentioned games youll also note the horrible story line and dialogue
well thats to be expected from capcom great fun really difficult horrible lines
the premise is simple dante the main character is trying to rid the world of the dark lord mundus
he comes across new powers and weapons to help him eliminate his many enemies and  bosses including mundusalright i must first say that this game is very easy to play through just once
youll start to play and then if you have trouble itll give you the option of going to the easy mode which also features automatic gun firing
there are four difficulty settings easy normal hard and dante must die
this is the greatest part of the game the difficulty settings
normal is pretty easy bosses are hit hard you are hit less and items cost less
in dante must die mode you must gather all your gaming ability together to survive let alone conquer
you do have the option of carrying all your gear and skills from one difficulty to the next so dont worry
starting off in dante must die mode would be impossible if you didnt have all your stuff
the bosses are also pretty darn hard
youll have fun fighting angelo a sword wielding warrior like yourself and youll absolutely hate the battles with nightmare who lives up to his name completelythe game play is simple enough moves around like zelda ocarina of time but you cant control your camera it just moves for you
aiming is done perfectly with the press of a button
you have melee weapons and combos that you can pull off with your melee weapon and your guns too
another great part of this game is the fighting style
you can juggle enemies with your sword and guns bomb them from a distance turn and break another enemy next to you apart and then slip into devil mode and cause the ground to explode
devil mode is like magic which allows you to access great skills and abilities for the price of you devil letters magic pointsyour skills are bought between missions or from an ox with an hourglass statue
the cash are red orbs
yellow orbs are basically lives blue orbs add to your life and often come in  fragments and purple orbs add another letter to your devil bar mp
you can use red orbs for buying for your two magic melee weapons or other orbs
your weapons are swords  types a pair of gauntlets dual pistols shotgun grenade launcher needlegun underwater only and a magic gun nightmare beta
no ammo count or reloading in fact if you can shoot fast enough you can keep dante suspended in air while firing off your dual pistolsthere are many secret missions that reward your with blue orbs life and two hidden characters after beating hard and dante must die difficulties
there is also a ranking system d c b a s sound familiar
they rank your missions based on time health red orb count and items used
they also rank your ability to keep the pain flowing via comboswho should get this
well fans of onimusha would like it resident evil fans may find the puzzles boring and the action very repetitive
it is not a great game in the sense of final fantasy  nor is it as fun as grand theft auto in fact youll play it beat it and then put in away
but i get it out every now and then just to kick some toshie and play around with super dante
the reason it has  stars is because its a game that will keep you playing until its over
then you can play through the extra modes and find the hidden stuff go for all s ranks on missions put it away
its short compared to other games took me  hours shortest timehappy huntingin the golden days of d action where the fist and foot were employed as your weapons and you would resolve your differences with enemies in good old fashion brawls sure it may have been simple maybe lame to some
but in many ways technical isnt deemed superior to simplistic
now with games of metal gear solid and even tenchu stealth assassins fights are recommended to be avoided stealth is now your friend and numerous tactics are provided sliding against walls crawling past guards even the cardboard box method in mgsto die hard action fans such as myself though you cant beat the sense and overall feel of straight forward fights no hiding and no running
you put up your fist your sword and now your infinite ammunition handguns and you break through anything in your path
and its the sheer feel of action that isnt contained but in fact over the top and out of control that gives devil may cry new life in the decaying genre of action games that are intended to play as a classic d action game in d worldsfrom capcom you necessarily wouldnt expect this type of game
now there is certainly no denying capcom knows a thing or two about fighting games but lately that as well as survival horror has been the main titles on their release list
of course devil may cry contains multiple factors easily reminiscent of the resident evil and onimusha engines
its not a combination of the two however it does create an entirely new feeling of its ownyou control the demonwarrior dante a sword wielding mercenary who packs two handguns each with their own names
with a sole mission of cleaning the floor with the demons of the st century
after acquiring certain weapons and abilities raging combos and powers ranging from lightning attacks discharged from dantes hands to tossing your sword like a boomerang will be at your disposal
some will even be required to progress through levels hence the double jump
special skills are earned by collecting red orbs and then exchanged at an idol where items can also be found
once a certain sword is equipped a devil trigger meter is given
connected hits on enemies will charge it and once filled dante can unleash powerful attacks by turning into his devil form virtually making him indestructiblebattle is simplified to three controls attack with sword attack with guns and jump
combination moves play an important role during dmc being ranks can be achieved during battle ranging from dull awesome and the elusive stylish stacking up stylish combos will most likely guarantee an a ranking after levels unless it is a time based objective
sadly for the fighting system there is no block button which can be very frustrating at time when dozens of enemies are attacking at once instead the jump button can also be used as a dodge method which salvages this fault a little but in a game requiring sword attacks and where enemies can defend themselves i see no reason why you shouldnt be able to
luckily the range of attacks can hit almost every enemy within a  degree section
thats a good thing being there is no lock on feature and you will be facing up to eight enemies at once nearly every battlethe environments are all cantered on a rusted castle from dark chambers underground water passages and gardens
the detail fit into these areas are no joke everything is animated incredibly there is a lavish fight in an area of waist deep grass and trees that left me in trance at the detail put into the surroundings
and much as resident evil and onimusha the lighting effects are topnotch
dante is walking down a hallway during a thunder storm in the middle of the night lightning flashing through the windows and crevices temporarily giving him a glimpse of the darkened hall ahead
of course these little effects come to no surprise given capcoms past creations
fantasy touches yes but once again multiple areas are revisited again and again
back tracking becomes very unattractive in games such as this being it begins to give a sense of complete repetition through nonplayable terms
youd think with bit systems these days companies could give more variety to gamersthe game is broken up into  missions which is a first for survival horror genre
the games course runs from  to  hours depending on how deeply you will delve into finding hidden items
after each mission red orbs are awarded for you combo rankings and time taken
certain objectives are assigned to each level some involving puzzles that are incredibly simple and hardly take any thought whatsoever
some may enjoy the frequent breaks during game play but the missions arent needed being how short of time is taken for some an example is the traditional get from point a to point b before time runs out the only mildly disturbing factor is that it can be done in less that  secondsso what is the upside from the preceding glitches
the amazing thing is devil may cry is the first game since the birth of the d gaming engine to revive the classic action found in the old dynasties of streets of rage and strider
once again out of control action is unleashed into glorious bit graphical power as it should be
its pure kinetic energy nonstop adventure thats like a geyser just waiting to burst once enemies appear on screen
capcom pulls out what so many companies have failed with recently in a simple phrase i can deem it a go for broke action packed extravaganzaa full feature game for only a few dollars is quite a steal
the disc came in a generic envelop however so it wouldve been nicer to get the actual case
still was a great dealthe good thingsthe storywhether you like it or not the story isnt that original or even compelling
you see i was spoiled by games with great plots or even characters i care aboutdantei think dante rocks and i care more about his journey than riddicks
plus he has a big sword whats more better than slicing things with a big swordthe gameplaythis game is really easy to get into and the controls are easy
and the game is an action extravaganzamy thoughtsin the end this was just an incredible hackandslash
so if you want to just kill things than this is the game for youdevil may cry is a great game
you will never see this game on a list of the  best games of all time but good game
the theme is interesting the sounds are killer the soundtrack shakes to the core the gameplay will always be challenging and the combos are engaginglike many games that have veered near the edge of greatness devil may cry will always fall short for two reasons
the game is tiny and the camera can never be worsethe entire game could buckle under these two minor issues
its obvious the makers had a seven hour game on their hands so they changed the difficulty in the game to stall process for even the hardcore player
there are few games where a boss needs only a couple swipes at our hero before we are reloading the same old cut scene to try once morethis difficulty leads us to a bigger problem
the camera in a squared room is usually set at four angles facing the corners of the room with one directly in the middle all of this instead of just looming over the head of our hero
when a camera angle switches you may find your character turning back the way he came
this is devastating considering fire columns scythes and lasers all follow our character at blind speed
you can probably imagine the difficulty one must face to avoid getting hit
lets just say its quite common to run directly right under a pouncing enemy for the lack of not being able to locate the enemy in time
add this to a  hit kill for our hero you might never want to crawl out of easy mode
honestly its pretty questionable why a gamer would even want to fight beyond the normal setting in this game but if you must bragging rights would definitely come with the territoryall in all people will want to look past these problems and play one of the few good actionplatformers for the psi had  hrs to beat this so i played  hrs straightthis game is all about fast paced free for all combo action fighting
rolling jumping shooting slashing flying whatever it takes
you are rated on your combos and how long they last which if you can pull it off can be long and tons of fun to do and watchid suggest playing easy mode first  because it is a lot easier than normal and its just more fun to pull off impossible combosa little too short with bad voice acting and dialouge are the only negative aspects of this gamethe title of my review really says it all
the gameplay is tons of fun and really addictive
the smooth transition between combos and combining of swords and firearms makes for some interesting battles
it really does look like something out of quotthe matrixquot the only problem is that the game is relatively short
its of good length just not really comparable to an rpg
at  bucks though its a must have
its be worth every dollar at that price and youd be crazy not to buy itdevil may cry is a great game for the sheer fact that you feel like youre kicking major butt the entire time
its a fun but simple game
the monsters are not terribly hard puzzles are easily solved and the story isnt too imaginative but they made up for that with the action
all you have to do is go crazy with the controller and you turn into a hyper active killing machine
the environments are beautifully detailed and the action is quite smooth
it is short game but so are most
its good to play when you dont feel like anything to complicated and want to get some frustrations outthe good super tight controls great variety of powerups weapons and attacks beautiful environments nonstop action very challenging great new gaming characterthe bad some ugly and hollow enemies vague storyline quirky camera can leave you blinded shortdifficulty harddmc is an action game that the gaming industry desperately needed
gaming was in more or less a casual rut and hardcore gamers were becoming sick of the simple games that while may have been innovative lacked depth and most of all a real challenge
dmc changes all this by bringing us an incredibly cool slick and likable new character gorgeous and unique level design and a battle system thatll give you so many special movies and upgrades that itll take about  playthroughs to actual be able to afford them all considering the red orbs you collect by slaying demons and monsters are what buy you new special movesyou control dante slick showoff guntoting sword wielding badboy extrordinaire who has a demon hunting business in some fictional city that one day gets visited by a mysterious woman who tells him of some god whos giving rise to the evil underworld
its pretty vague and unfortunately the rest of the games simple story gets almost lost on you because many times the action and sound effects will be so loud the character dialogue is near inaudible
anyway you enter this gothic castle and the game has you playing through missions that have you completing a certain task in order to get through to the next level all within the same castle of course
dont worry backtracking is kept to a minimalthe first thing most gamers will notice is the unpredictable challenge
the first level boss is tough and simply standing near him swiping your sword and jumping away every few seconds as many other games allow will only lead you to an early grave
defeating these enemies takes a quick eye and even quicker reflexes as many bosses reappear randomly in certain areas and due to the continue system in the game purchasing yellow orbs gets you back to a checkpoint but any items youve used before you died will be gone the second time around and if youre out of yellow orbs youve got to start the level all over again which becomes downright heartbreaking a few times the  missions in the game may only take about  or  hours in total but youll be playing a lot longer considering all the deaths and retries youll be using
the game becomes progressively more difficult but due to the gradual learning curve the gameplay itself will become easier to manage because gamers will get this build thier skill
the great thing about dmc is that it emphasizes skill and reflexes not button mashing
unfortunately at a few points in the game the third person camera which isnt controlled by the player in some boss fights works against you and can leave you wondering where exactly you are and in what direction you need to be attacking which can lead to a death at a point thatll send you directly to the beginning of the level swear inducing stuff
in simplist terms this game is hard but ultimately rewardingbesides the challenge the environments are beautiful
the gothic and romantically dark castle feels surrealistic at some points and really takes a personality all its own
still the same cant be said about some very blocky and pixalated enemies who can look downright ridiculous at some points one boss had me asking myself what the hell is that thing supposed to be
other enemies are somewhat funny looking also and unfortunately forgetful and dont carry anywhere near the type of memorable personality from a game like resident evil still i had loads of fun with this game and for the first time in a very long time the game made me feel good about finally beating it which is a lot more than i can say about a lot of overly long yet easy games out there
im a dante fan for lifebottom line for true hardcore gamers this is a must buy for the casual madden nfl guy go back to your beer and let the real gamers playive heard the reviews saying that devil may cry was one of the greatest games ever
well i wouldnt go that far but it is a good game
devil may cry is a fight and slash game with a haunting background and a terrible storyline
it does work well though and flows nicelythis game has some problems but those are not problems that detract from the gameplay too wildly
first off it commits the greatest cardinal sin or all time  you cannot save at any point
this immediately means that at least some of the game will contain repetition
my second biggest gripe is the camera angle is situated at stationary spots
it does not follow you around like other games
worse is that when you move the camera angle will switch to a vastly different view
this ranges from inconvenient when navigating a room to hellish when youre running and jump attacking a monster and the room suddenly flips on you
i also thought the front end and menus were a little unintuitive and the fact that you couldnt adjust the music and sound volume separately was also annoyingthe game starts off with a bad storyline and then dante whom you play is placed into a dark foreboding castle where the entire game takes place
its safe to say this background rates up there with final fantasy  and ico
you then fight your way through different small levels collecting orbs and objects to advance to the next level
at about the third level you can choose which difficulty you can play
with the easiest level you can just hack and slash and special attacks will be automatically done
in the harder levels you can do those stupid random up up down a b l right down down combo moves that are in fighter games
needless to say i took the more straightforward levelthe game consists of a little over  missions
some missions consist of moving from one place to another others are a little more complex in that it requires you to gather an object and place it with an another and some require you to beat a boss
either way the missions rarely consist of backtracking there is little wandering or not knowing where you are going and there is a little repetition
the movies are rare and skippible so the action is rarely interrupted
this means that the game has a great flowall in all its a good game
as a greatest hits game its a superb valueproshaunting atmospherewhich difficulty selected determines type of gamegreat flowhardly any pointless wanderingconsfixed cameracannot save at any pointtime hours easy difficultyfrustration levellowthe creators of this game had the right idea
and they did an alright job at it
action is everywhere
nonstop
sometimes that gets old while other times it is just what you want
bosses can be quite tough that is a downside
sometimes too tough especially at the beginning of the game when you have little developed skills and items to recover
i got frustrated a lot first playing this game
but i must say once you get over those first few humps and start developing those needed skills this game is action packed and you really get into
the action then is always fun
 stars with the slow and frustrating beginning as the downsidei bought re cvx only partially because i like resident evil
the other reason was to see the devil may cry demo
from what i have seen this game is just the kind i like
i like challenge but am not huge on super complex puzzles
i like long games but a  something hour long game of final fantasy or chrono trigger is a bit muchfrom what i have read and what i have seen in the demo dmc has a good blend of puzzles and mindless hack amp slash and in this case shoot as well and it wont take me  hours of play to finishi must commend capcom i can actually control this character wow
the graphics are hot the game play pleasurablethe story exciting you must play this game
i warn you  this game has alittle blood and gore but who cares its great
i find myself playing this game over and over it has appeal  all games has faults but i can live the set backs of this game definitely a classic i recommend you buy this one laterzzzzzzzzsuper street fighter ii turbo revival was released on the game boy advance in  based on the excellent super nes port of the arcade hit it is basically shrunk down so you can play it on the go
for what it is worth its a great port that while not perfect is a blast to play and one of many games that you can own for the gbain case you havent played any street fighter title you start by picking a character and the computer pits you against the others from different countries represented by the various stages
eventually youll learn your characters moves plow through bonus stages to earn extra points and face off against m bison the main games final boss
and thats the gist of it so get ready to fightthe pros this is a great port of a great snes title and shows what you can do on the game boy advance
the intro is cool to watch the stages are colorful and are almost identical to what you saw from the snes title
the sound effects and music are spot on while the controls once you get used to them feel good and you will pull off moves with little ease
this game features a point system that will let you unlock additional content such as an art gallery an extra character and extra game modes once you earn enough points and it automatically saves your progress
connect your gba with someone else who has the same game and you can fight against the other personthe cons not much to say here except for two small issues
the gba has  buttons so in order to keep the  button layout that all street fighter games uses  for punches  for kicks the controls are set up so that the l and r buttons are for high punch and high kick and then b and a buttons are for light punch and light kick
to use the medium effect you press b and a buttons longer so you can use the medium punch and medium kick respectively
it sounds confusing but it is easy to pull off so it doesnt interfere with the game play
also while the graphics are pretty much what you see in the snes title the gba version takes a hit in the frames of animation in order for it to run smoothsuper street fighter ii turbo revival is a great port of the snes title released before it
despite its shortcomings and with added content and support for  players it is a fun game with added replayability that will keep you busy for awhile
you can find this for a low price now so if you see it pick it up
i recommend it for all street fighter fans and gamers aliketaking gamers back to the days when capcom couldnt count to three super street fighter ii turbo revival for the gba raises the bar set for handheld brawlers by the shortlived neo geo pocketalmost instantly the game hits you with a wave of nostalgia from the street fighter of old
capcom has done a great job in reviving the oldschool graphics and original ssf roster retaining all their moves and also packing super heat
but as they say the more things stay the same the more they change
most of the backgrounds have been replaced the musics been downgraded somewhat the training mode doesnt fight back and the game gets easier to beat after a whilethe games biggest problem wouldve been the control setup for the gba
but by pressing the select button during gameplay its now a whole lot easier to perform specials fireball forward  punch and supers a  b
youll be saying hadoken so much the word will lose all meaning
but for some reason this doesnt work on charge moves that and your thumbs will still hate youthough game features are limited the minigames in some modes should keep you busy including the beloved breakable car and barrels
you also earn reward points from matches that go toward an image gallery and other goodies
so even if youve already traded your gba for the ds this is still the best fighting game for itso farthis game is rated e for everyone violencethis game is really fun for someone like me who hasnt played street fighter ii since it came out on snes and im not even talking about the turbo version
the graphics are nice and the gameplay is fun
im giving it  stars instead of  for the following reasons  once you get the hang of your favorite character and you play through the game a time or two itll be fun to beat the crap out of people for awhile but the game will certainly start getting old especially after you unlock the akuma dressed in blue and you can absolutely pummel the crap out of everyone  i went from playing the game on the default difficulty the first time through up to level  on the next
call me crazy but there wasnt much of a noticable difference in difficulty to me outside of a few characters blanka guile and vega  this game has some major glitches that really take away from the experience for me
first unless im missing something like a combination of buttons you have to press theres no way to reset your progress
in other words once you unlock characters and get so far with your scores and best times with all the other challenges youre stuck with those but thats not the end of the glitches
many of the numbers for your best times show up all jumbled the button menu no longer works just freezes the game and sometimes when i beat m bison the game either glitches to a jumbled screen and freezes or glitches to a screen with a silhouette of akiras big noggin and  you guessed it  freezesso if i want to start this game over from scratch it looks like im going to have to buy it new since other used ones will be somewhere in the same state i guess again
outside of the things mentioned above i still love playing this game from time to time
ive had it for well over a year now
overall its a great game but easy to master and glitchy after a certain pointgraphics  this game has really good graphics but they are on such a small screen that its hard to even really notice
if you dont mind the small screen then you will love the graphics for the gamegameplay  the gameplay is really original but not all that great
basically you run around different maps which there arent that many different ones and use your pet a wierd protector thingy in the virtual world to quotjackquot into any electronic thing to defeat viruses
the only reason i rated this only a  was because the world inside the electronic devices are so crazy that you can never find your way around which gets really annoying when you have to get somewhere far away
the battling is probably the best part of this game
in battle you and your opponent get x squares to stand on
there are also later in the game obsticals in the field to move around
in battle you can move around in real time instead of turnbased
by pressing both triggers together when the quotcustomquot bar reaches full you can pick between all your collected quotbattle chipsquot which you get in the real world
battle chips are kind of like magics but they can only be used once
you only get to have  of your battle chips in battle so choose wisely
their are i think  battle chipssound  i gave it a  because i never really think about the sound so i dont really care if its good or badreplay value  this is one of the only rpgs ive ever played that has replay value
what really makes this game great is collecting all the battle chips
their are  so this takes a while but it is fun and it helps you in battle
unfortunatly you dont get anything that incredible when you get them all except bragging rightsoverall score  this game is great but the second one is definetly better
too bad you cant bring your battle chips over to the second one
oh wellmega man battlew network for the gba is a nice game that is unlike most mega man games
in this mega man game you fight on a grid with you on one side and the enemy on another side
on this grid you can fire as many shots as you want and can choose a special card from a group to use
this is quite fun and most people should enjoy it
when not in battle you can move around freely and talk to people
you can fight some of the pets of these people
the plot is pretty basic though there is a small twist
when hooked to the net you can get into random battles and earn money
there is also a small rpg element present
you can earn upgrades to mega man and improve his health attack etc
the only problem is that the game can become frustrating if you cannot find out where to go nextmegaman battle network is the newest addition to the megaman spinoffs
this series takes place in an alternate universe of the original where megaman roll and protoman are all digital life forms called navis
as always you control megaman as well as his human operator year old lan hikari
together lan and megaman must fight the battle of their lives as they take on the www
whether your a fan of megaman or of digimon tamers which this series was inspired off of or both youll enjoy this game and its plot twistsas of  mega man has been around for  years
needless to say the little guy has been quite prolific hopping deftly from game platform to platform and bravely exploring and acquiring the skills of new genres
aside from numerous action outings the blue bomber has raced carts played soccer and has even entered a few fighting tournaments
after testing the waters in the legends series mega man has donned an exe file extension and entered the battle network in a traditional rpg for the game boy advance
battle network is the story of a boy and his pet
in the year xx humankind has entered the quotnetwork agequot to navigate this hightech world it has become necessary for every man woman and child to carry portable exploration devices known as pets
each pet has a personality which manifests in the form of a net navi
these trusty digital assistants help you navigate the net check your email and battle against malicious code
after deleting a nasty virus from his oven which charred his breakfast and very nearly his own mother fifth grader lan and his best friendnet navi mega man begin to investigate the nefarious www organization
while lan searches the real world for clues hell be able to jack in to various computers and electronic devices
in the cyberworld mega man takes over the active role
as mega man youll be able to do a bit of online shopping to upgrade your battle capabilities visit your friends computers and do a liberal amount of virus bustingwhether youre controlling mega man or lan youll be able to talk to the character youre not currently playing as for direction and support
when youre at a loss as to where to go or what to do your partner should be able to provide at least a vague idea of what you should be doing
at certain points youll have to switch control back and forth to accomplish your goal
for instance lan may have to reboot a crashed computer to open up the way for mega man
the battle system of battle network is probably its most original and compelling feature
unlike in a traditional rpg skill is a primary factor here
mega man does gain levels by installing upgrade programs to increase hit points and attack power but in true mega man tradition quick reflexes and recognizing attack patterns can take you far
battles take place on a by grid initially split in two dividing your area from the enemys
you and the enemy will move and attack in real time which results in fastpaced but strategic encountersin addition to his triedandtrue buster arm mega man will use battle chips to aid him in battle
each has a different range and effect
he will have a multitude of damagedealing chips such as spreader and longsword as well as chips that can steal or destroy tiles recover life or even call in another navi for help
you initially start with five chips randomly chosen from your folder and when the battle gauge at the top of the screen is full you will receive more battle chips
as in a card battle game collecting new chips and managing your folder will give you an edge in battle
choosing chips with similar names or codes can allow you to use more than one chip at a time or perform powerful special attacks
new battle chips can be traded rewarded for efficient deletion of enemies or found online
the games battle system aptly captures the essence of mega man and so does the colorful visual style
the boy in blue himself has been smartly redesigned as have other classic characters like roll guts man and proto man
there are an abundance of visual and verbal references that fans will immediately pick up on and the accompanying music matches up just as well as the visuals
largely due to the battle system the game is quite engaging and is in many ways unique among rpgs
if theres something that might hold you back from enjoying the game its the lighthearted and somewhat goofy story
however the game doesnt take itself too seriously so neither should you
filling your folder with rare and powerful battle chips battling against net crime and reveling in the silliness of the quotnetwork agequot can make for a very worthwhile gaming experienceit may not be the megaman we all know an love but its something special all right
the game is a great take on the megaman series and is very fun
you select battle chips as weapons and you get the battle chips from defeating others on the netabout my only complant is it gets boring
running back and forth and back and forth
i guess thats a flaw with a fair amount of rpgs though
great game though but i doubt ill buy the sequal since it doesnt seem to differ muchthis is so hard i only beat one boss
im still wondering if i should get mega man  instedtevery game has some problems
this game had a lot of them
however thats what they get for working on two games simultaniously
yes you heard right
mega man x and x were produced by two different teams almost at the same time
work for these games started about a year and a half after xs release about the time legends  made its debut
then legends  went into production and capcom came up with ways to tie legends and x in together
so with  mega man games in production at close to not exactly
the same time the plot has more holes in it than a car being gunned down by the mafia
the biggest one is the obvious misinterpretation of the  years weeks anomaly
in actuality the time span between x and x is three weekswhats interesting about the last two games though is that they tie in to the legends series
i dont remember exactly what game its in but x does indeed comment at the end that one of his ambitions is to build a new space colony that he calls elysium which is exactly what the space colony in legends  was calledalthough the two games are similar in style and all the contrasts between the two are vast
x was unbelievably unbalanced and easy and could more than easily be beaten in one day given the time
x is difficult  probably one of the most difficult mega man games yet
not only does it bombard you with enemies but those nightmare creatures can be a real pain in the arse
theres also a flaw in this game which no other mega man game has  the ability to get stuck
yep literally stuck
in most of these cases the only way out of these screwy areas is to kill yourself and start over againa very noteable feature on this game is the japanese voice acting
personally i liked it
some people think it was capcom being lazy this time around
well that may very well have been the case but hey its better than those crappy american voices right
at least were hearing the voices as they should beoverall i liked this game
its definitely lacking in terms of polish and last minute checks but its still an entertaining game providing youve played mega man before
dont let this or x be your first time playing mega man
chances are that youll be scarred to play any othersstart with x and if you like that one rent the other two first and then make buying decisionsk  heres the deal with x its hard
mostly though its not the hard as in needs skill and timing and practice but hard as in they fill the screen with as much stuff as they can and you just have to try and survive  when i first played the game i was so infuriated at the lameness that i couldnt play it for a week
but im glad i started again
once you take the time to learn the levels its a really fun game
plot kinda reminds me o x and zero needs to stay dead  but its funalso the levels arnt randomly generated as much as theyre randomly alteredi want to apologize for making this review so long but i felt as though this game needed to be explained thoroughly
mega man x
part six of sevenafter the somewhat disappointing x another sequel appeared less than a year later
how is this possible
according to another reviewer apparently both x and x were created at the same time by two different teams under capcom
for the most part x is a combination of xs style and xs complexity
it contains the same graphics and classic gameplay as the previous two x games but there are several features to this game that set it apart from the others
heres the breakdownprosthankfully there are no more mandatory alia messages
capcom realized this mistake from x and made this feature optional
a small 
appears in the corner when you reach key points in the stage and if you ever need them true mm junkies dont just press select
finally we get completely uninterrupted gameplaythe difficulty has been vamped up drastically
this can be a good thing and a bad thing more on the bad later
the good thing is that the game is no longer a cakewalk to beat like x and x
the enemies will definitely give the player something to keep busy withperhaps the most nonlinear x game in the series
by that i mean all the levels are vast containing two different exits and large arenarooms to explore
plus the secret items are all cleverly scattered
you have to do more thinking than ever before to obtain some of themthe sound effects are slightly different than before
now the explosions really let out a bang
also some of the stage tunes are a return to xs techno hardrock style namely the heatnix wolfgang mijinion and shark stagesrescuing the  different reploids
this adds even more depth to x and allows the player to gain enhancements by rescuing themx can now use the zsaber
while it is not very good as a rapid attack weapon it does help to reflect projectiles in the heat of combatconsokay now the bad thing about the difficulty some areas in the game lead to pointless frusteration
when i say that enemies come in endless waves i mean that they throw everything and the kitchen sink at you
it comes to the point where even a veteran mm gamer cannot make it through each stage without losing lives
the nightmare system does not help this
often times annoyances like meteors fireflies blackouts and impassible silver blocks will take more effort to get through than normal stage enemies which is nonsense
and its all randomly generatedthere are too many nightmare enemies
in some stages like the museum most every enemy you face will be one of those
a little more variety in the bestiary would have benefitedbesides the four tracks i mentioned the rest of the music is dull boring popish and often annoying
i personally cannot stand the museum stage tune
and whats with the grunge intro track
this does not even fit with the x universelevels are not randomly generated like the box claims
okay capcom i dont care if the levels were actually random or not but its a really bad move to make a boast about a feature thats not thereonce again the bosses are rather easy to beat
this is a bit of a letdown after how incredibly hard some of the stages are
contrary to this though the miniboss high max seems almost too difficult to beatlike the whale stage in x the repeating junkball mini boss in heatnixs stage gets tedious after going through the stage more than twice
it hurts the most when youre going back to rescue just one reploidthe story pretty much shot down the drain with this game
the cutscenes though voiceacted in japanese drag on for a looooooong time
like i said with x bring back the anime cutscenes
zero should either be here to stay or gone for good
none of this dramatic death and resurrection junk
one other thing stop resurrecting sigma
play x for the gameplay itself not the storyonce a reploid gets caught by a nightmare he can never be rescued again
in order to get him back you have to reload the game
this can get annoying with some reploidsx can obtain two excellent pairs of armor blade and shadow but getting them requires you to endure the random nightmare system until the right hazard comes along in a particular stage
you cant acquire anything else without themx as a whole is a fun challenging and more often than not a frusterating game
however i only recommend this one to experienced gamers as this is one of the hardest mm titles to date
with a bit more work this game could have easily been a classic
despite all the shortcomings it succeeds in retaining the classic d gameplay that makes mega man games what they are
im only being so critical on this game because i am an incredibly big mm fan who cares about the series
the story is the weakest part of x but give the game a chance
its at least worth playing through one time
get equipped with bubble lead all over again and go give it a shotplay this game first with zero before you get mega man zero
this game is okay put it gets dull because it is the same old same old i wish capcom offered something different besides mega man having zero saber
i got this game because i wanted to see the story of the mega man x saga continue
good news the next mega man x game mega man x will be on ps and in di am a huge megaman fan
in fact i got into the x series through  i didnt have a snes so i couldnt play  or the first  x games
the fluid animation fo the enemies voices and anime cut scenes had me hooked
then when  hit we had voices in english but not anime cutscens we had pictures and written dialouge
ok forgivable now  comes out and what we have are japanese voices in both the clips and enemy voices
this is like deception  all of a suddenhowever through that little flaw we have magnificent gameplay areas
the levels are virtually the same except through the little nightmare feature they will sometimes feature a little change in the level jungle or a huge change recycle centerand so you have to go back and find more hidden surprises
also you must rescue people or else little enemy nightmares will infect them and they will vanish or die your choicenow the bosses
the bosses some are incredibly simple or barbarically difficult
once you beat blaze heatlix you can take out most of them though
also these guys have no weapon weakness thus it makes the whole fun of getting variouse weapons pointlesson a side note however this game is fun but very frustrating
as a wordm of advice dont even think about taking out the final level without the shadow armor and  subtanks
first boss alone will drain themi remember buying this game for my super nintendo years ago
the game was made by capcom but distributed by squaresoft and anything by square had to be good rightanyway the game itself was fun if standard
you control ryu as he and his merry band of adventurers attempt to defeat an evil dragon whose name escapes me now i am sorry to say
of course the story spirals from here and you are caught up in a plot by a goddess to rule the world
by todays standards it may seem trite but there are many bonuses for example how many games let you fish
your characters eight or nine in total each have special abilities allowing you to open secret areas which adds to the replay value
all in all i thoroughly enjoyed the game although i think it has been seven or eight years since i played it
however i am sure that the advance version will have new bonuses so needless to say ill be killing a few more hours with this game
i think it is worth checking outi first played breath of fire  years ago back when the snes was all the rage and i am reminded of how much fun it was
though it was not as good as the final fantasy games it is a decent rpg
i am glad i have it again since the snes cart is a rare find these daysthe original bit graphics and music have been restored making the game feel very retro
this is a major plus for me because i cannot imagine playstation quality graphics on such a tiny system
every element of the original is here the battle system the characters the secrets and the stories
the story is typical rpg standard which now seems cliched since all the similar rpgs have come out on the psx
but i always say that the originals are the best and i am not wrong in this casethe only real drawback to this version is the often fuzzy sound which can be quite annoying
the editorial review mentioned that the sound is a bit tinny but i found it more fuzzy
maybe it is just a problem with my gba but i havent noticed it on any other gamebof is a nastalgia trip for me and will prove just as good for first time players
it is one of the classic rpgs and one i recommend getting before it becomes rare like the older versionsreviewed for big boss games by trcbreath of fire by capcom for the gameboy advance gameboy micro and nintendo ds
this is yet another port from the snes to the gba system
breath of fire is one of the lesserknown rpgs that turned out to be really goodyou start out as a young teen and your town is under attack from the dark dragonsyour older sister sacrifices herself to save you and the town
thus starts your quest for revenge
you meet up with a princess a thief a bad merchant a wolfenhunter a mole person the brute ox and a sorceress
all of them have talents you will need to get your revenge
be prepared for a  hourlong questgraphics   for a gba based game the graphics are good
there are some movielike full motion videosmusic   same as the snes version capcom could have updated itgameplay   fun and addictive some of the minigames like fishing digging and hunting were lots of funbattle system   the same turn based system we all know and love with the addition of being able to turn into a dragon and morph into a mix of the people on your team
the magic system is earned in levels and by finding the spellsoverall   the game was fun and kept me entertained until the very endmy only complaint is that they could have updated the story and the music a bit
burn baby burnshaken by the lack of excitement or engrossment upon pss breath of fire iii i shook my head in disgrace feeling betrayed by a series in which i held in such appreciation
a full fledged fantasy reader by that time the lackluster and insipid dialogue dragged me far far away from capcoms rpg
but its not to say i was never a fan
i was
and if extrapolations are accurate bof v will come out bursting in noble bearing and reestablish my fanhood
i am though very fond of the first two bof games
both games early drafts of the future fabrication of traditional rpgs had an excuse to have unsavory dialogue of todays gutwrenching standards
anyway back in the day bof was an underrated landmark of rpg greatness
vaguely recalling how i lost my copy for the snes i think it revolved around a starving kid and one of his favorite rpgs i felt compelled to revisit the game on the gba
borrowing it from a friend then stuffing my flabby butt on a warm cozy couch reasons why i was so intrigued with bof slowly seeded and came into palpable emergencesquare originally published the game hence the word publish
they did not get their hands in the grim and take part in the actual production
capcom did
in their effort they shaped something entirely new and unsuspectingly praiseworthy
unlike most plotdriven rpgs an rpg to have a story woven around dragons is enormously sporadic
personally embracing a scenario set in the combat of dragons i found myself coaxed and immersed into a nifty plotthe tale picks up when ryu a dragon disguised as a bluehair human sets out to envelop vengeance on the wicked dark dragon clan
leaving ryus home village in ashes the dark dragon clan then focuses their sights on freeing tyr the female apocalypse
ryu ordained by his higher ranks must prevent this with his personal score to settle
on his lengthy journey he enlists the aid of a few comrades and ultimately helps them resolve their sticky origins
what struck me most about bof was the balls capcom had
they presented some of the most oddball characters ever made
characters like gobi a fishman bo a wolfman and the mogu a moleman wouldnt have been so well received in todays grueling critiques
nevertheless the likable cast is quite a departure to be hadgameplaywise the traditional rpg menu of fight magic item and defend are faithfully intact
bof is  your customary fantasy quest with all the stereotypical dungeons and environments to delve into
what truly set bof apart form traditional rpg counterparts though is ryus ability to morph into a number of mighty dragons
each dragon had its magical property cladding the game in sorts of strategic value
all throughout the vast lands dragon shines were found
when ryu entered one he and he alone proceeded in a  backbreaking duel with another dragon to gain its type
gratifying the challenge appetite those shrine battles were  particularly unforgiving but with time and reevaluating the line of attacks success reeled inoutside the shelter of friendly towns the game is played in a d overview and the party usually went to explore dungeons and what not
each character had a special skill not directly found in combat but in discovering pathways those are ox who demolishes walls and  mogu who dug passageways underground
together with all the trappings of an oldschool rpg bof has some addictive minigamesbo is a professional when it came to his use of bow and arrow and he snapped the bowstring when animals were found moving on screen
the hides of animals are traded in towns for several items
but of all the minigames ryus ability to fish was awkwardly addicting
nicely executed bof on the gba identically matches the snes experienceon its presentation the graphics on the gba are nearly indistinguishable as the original
the only exceptions are the upgraded view of vibrancy
not flamed with glamour like golden sun bof is as simple as colorful pixel art
hey with its fluid sprite animation and additions of new face portraits i have no latent quibble
the tunes are swell stuffed in the right moments and keeps a hale and hearty overall feel
besides the discharging world music is godsend briefly hypnotizing me back into what i havent played in agesfor the most part bof employed and triggered old snes nostalgia
grateful of the gba port i propose rpg fans to take a look
if and only if your expectations are skyhigh in a games design and if you do have a copy of breath of fire with a healthy snes i wouldnt go as far as to purchase it because the enhancements are minimal
replete with all the trimmings of a lustrous oldschool combination of sorts bof is a whipping combination of blueprints on how traditional rpgs came to be
even in a new era of gaming and the lack of fancyschmancy graphics i hope never to return this enjoyable cartridge to my pal because friends are for the taking and this little gem is already lodged along the likes of golden sun and portable zelda greatsfinal fantasy aside breath of fire is one of the longestrunning rpg series around and the handheld version of the first adventure gets decent treatment
yet despite the reappearance of the games fresh visuals and unique play aspects the lifeless narrative doesnt provide the immersive experience that youd expect
originally released by square on the super nes in  breath of fire arrives on the game boy advance with enhanced cinemas but otherwise remains unchanged
you play as ryu a lone hero who can also transform into a variety of powerful dragons
during the course of ryus quest various characters join your party each with their own personal demons and diversions that involve the entire team
an rpgs lifeblood is a strong story but bofs narrative is remarkably uninvolving
youll spend a lot of time engaging in mundane tasksquottalk to a then b then a again and then cquotand navigating a series of seemingly endless mazes
even the turnbased battles lack flair except for the boss battles
be prepared to spend a lot of time with this one but a new dash feature speeds you through the game and saves batteries
bof delivers a tight visual and audio package
colorful sprites fill the screen with arresting colors and special effects while the soundtrack provides decent music accompanied by muted sound effects
workmanlike controls feature easy menu navigation and responsive character movement
on the whole breath of fire is an enjoyable rpg that easily kills spare time
just dont expect a thoroughly involving adventure on the same level as later games in the seriesthe original breath of fire
you start out as ryu one of the villagers of a dragon clan that is being attacked
a very short time in the beginning of the game you dont do much otherwise than moving around
itll then follow the scene where your character is frozen but soon afterward youll be able to continue onprosanimated turnbase fighting the characters dont just stand then move foward then do an attack
the graphics are designed where they actually move while their idlefighting and react to being hit
which was pretty cool seeing that most of the tb games back there were just standing aroundnina seems like the smaller version of the grownupnina in bofminigames such as fishing are fun in their origindifferent characters to add to your partyconsgameplay is dated along with graphicssnes direct portmusic is datedrandom battlesbe prepared to walk around alotmay seem short by todays standardsbreath of fire is the start of the original series
although not as good as its second installment bof it is still a cool game to add to any oldschool gamers collectionthis is a great game that will provide a ton of enjoyment for gamers even those who arent avid tennis fans
hell even the original pong was a kickash game that was addictive as all gets out and tennis k simply takes that original classic premise and amplifies it to involve more skill more complexities more details more of everything
the graphics arent too shabby either
unfortunate that this game was released so late in the dreamcasts life cycletennis k has a very similar feel to its predecessor virtua tennis
the gameplay mechanics is virtually identical
the main difference is that k now has a few new shot selections
the other difference is that k now includes female playersyou get well known tennis gals such as venus and serena williams lindsay davenport monica seles and mary pierce
the mens side features a weak lineup of playerspatrick rafter is the most well knownyou get tournament exhibition and world tour along with training and createaplayer modes
the graphics is smoother and you have a wider selection of courts which include hard clay grass and turftheres also a mystery courts you can buyfor those familiar with virtua tennis this game will feel like a smooth extension with more precise gameplay and the ability to choose the women players
one of the best tennis games out there for the sega dreamcasti have enjoyed playing this game alot
excellent graphics fun gameplay
it may not be the most realistic nfl game out there but it is alot of fun
i played nfl k on the dreamcast and found it very playable
this has the same level of playability with better graphics
it is well worth the money to buy
unless you have madden
both games are good and i enjoyed playing them both but you probobly do not need to buy both gamesi am going to write a review of nflk but also compare it to madden  for those of you caught on the fence on which to buy
ill point out what each game does better over the othernflk does better over madden  faster gameplay  just like the real nfl
make quick and correct decisions or eat the turf
truly realisitc to the real game in this aspectgreat defensive line play  its like a minigame to sack the qb
maddens dline game is nonexistant for the most partdefensive backs actually play defense and cover people
unlike in madden where the cpu cheatscpu somehow knows who your passing to right when you start to hit the button
bad passes will get intercepted so you have to be accurate with your throws and routes your rungreat graphics especially player facial renditions and taller player modelsbetter atmospheresoundscommentary than madden
this part of the game nflk blows maddens sterile atmosphere awaymadden  does better than nflkbetter depth to the game than nflk create teamstadiumlogo   old time teams minute drill minigame etcplayer based momentum physics make the game more of a simulation
sometimes the momentum physics is a bit overdone but it is more true to life as in the nflbetter running game than nflk but not by much
running the ball through the middle of the line is tough just like real life
but sometimes sweeps are too easy
but overall very goodfranchise mode in madden  is very deep
nflk has a decent franchise mode but maddens is much much bettergameplay silders  this is where madden does better than nflk
the gameplay sliders give the player freedom to set the difficulty of the game to the players skill levelin conclusion both games are good
nflk is more of a fun game overall where whereas madden is more of a simulation but a bit boring due to the lack of atmosphere
both games feature good gameplay and option features that the other doesntthe dreamcast nfl k i feel was a much better game than madden  however in comparing nfl k and madden  i would give the nod to maddennfl k is a good game built on the very solid k version it updated the graphics this year to an already great looking game
imho the graphics are just nicer than madden  especially the facial close up
while madden made great strides in their audio commentary it pales in comparison to nfl ks
the response is fairly quick whereas madden uses a momentum based response that felt sluggish at times but i think the game ai makes too much of a jump when you go from rookie to pro and not much of a jump from pro to allprogoing pro in nfl k is just much much harder and takes awhile to adjust to i feel that madden does a much better job letting you tweek various attributes help on catching breaking tackle defense etc within each level
pro mode in k really punishes you for bad passes
however the k ai playmaking overall seems stronger and will run out the clock or call time outs in a realistic manner  and it wont allow you except in rookie mode to run the same types of plays without making you pay for itthe franchise mode is really the main reason i play these games even though madden had lots of great little game drills and madden is simply better herei like the way players grow or decline within a season in nfl k and the ability to trade present and future picks i also feel that during the signing process the computer is willing to negotiate in k they are willing to sign for less over repeated attempts where in madden its a cut and dry salary offer
but madden seems much deeperwith madden you can create new teams new players and new stadiums in the franchise mode  although creating new teamstadiums requires you to replace an existing teamstadium which help preserve the seasonal matchups
i also feel that madden have a more realistic allowance for retiring players where in nfl k you will routinely have the computer retiring players who havent been injured and having good seasons in their primeoverall im glad nfl k is available for the ps and is an enjoyable game
just as i believe madden learned a lot about what worked in nfl k the nfl series should take at a good look at madden if this game is going for less than ten dollars then i recommend grabbing it
otherwise you might as well get one of the newer versions
i love basketball games on the ps and this was relatively cheap so i grabbed it while i could
good timewaster and fun to just shoot some baskets without worrying too much about depthi have played by this and nba live  and though both do a good job bringing basketball to this ps i think this one is a little better
one of the things that gives nba k the edge is the franchise mode which lets you play multiples seasons make tradessiginings and draft new players each year
however even though the gameplay is great and the graphics are excellent there are a lot of little annoying things in this game including glitches however glitches only happen very very rarely
still overall for ps this is the best nba game this seasonwell i have mixed feelings about this game
k has the best control scheme for the players and moves of any bball game ever
the variety of moves dunks and animation are amazing
this alone makes it better than the live series ever was
the graphics are superb and the overall fun level is great
but the difficulty levels are ridiculous
the pro level is hardly a challenge for an experience live or k gamer
then the allstar level is near impossible kind of like in the nfl series
this level allows for no mistakes whatsoever or else the computer automatically scores whether the shot is contested or not
the only way to play d is to steal or block the ball
that is not fun
they need a level in between that allows shot contesting to make the opponent miss the shot or somethinganother qualm i have is the presentation of the players in menus
the individual player screens give only a few choice positiondependant ratings
this makes it difficult to judge how good the player really is
also there arent many free agents to choose from in franchise and season settings
live still has the upper hand in the franchise department
if k could figure a way to keep their gameplay and add the menus and franchise options of the live series they would be on top foreverjust my opinion though
id still by it over any of the live games to date thoughnba k is simply the best basketball game out there
the game play is fast and exciting
the post moves are the best ive ever seen in a game especially the drop steps
the players make realistic cuts and movements most of the time
my only grips graphical slowdown occurs a little too much computer is nearly unbeatable plays can be difficult to call at key times some players cant be stopped bc they are just too quotsoupedquot up unrealistic movements john stockten doing a  dunk yeah right
street mode is a blast to play much more fun than lives one on one mode
bottom line greatest bball game ever creatednot being satisfied with eas nba live series i was anticipating the release of nba k for the ps
id never played it before but the reviews of nba k for the dreamcast were so great that i was intrigued by the game
i thought id give it a shot and ive not been disappointedgraphics  although the graphics in nba live are slightly better than k in my opinion the graphics are still strong in this effort
for the most part the animation is fluid but as with any console game there are a few minor bugs eg
arms passing through other players bodiessound  the sound is very realistic but the playbyplay isnt the best
its still better than nba live thoughinterface  somewhat cumbersome but really not a tremendous obstacle
as a player of ea sports games it took me a while to grasp the buttons to use for which menus but this was still a minor problem for megameplay i have to say that the controls in this game are much tighter than in nba live
in nba live  i felt like my players were skating and sliding all over the place
in nba k i know my players are going to go where i direct themthe franchise mode in nba k is solid also
i like the fact that you can trade future draft picks as well as players
i do wish however that sega would use number ratings to gauge rate players
as it stands now youre given only a bar graph on about  different physical traits
the only number you get is in the overall ratingoverall ive thoroughly enjoyed this game
although ive been a fan of ea sports products over the last few years its been mainly by default
there simply hasnt been strong competition in terms of sports sims
in my opinion ea has been resting on its laurels lately and ss sega continues to develop its software for other consoles i fully expect them to give ea a runin short if youre looking for an nba game this is the one to get starsi usually never give a  star rating but this game comes very close
this game replicates the best simulation of the game of basketball in any level  highschoolcollegepro  even amatuer
i will list the good and bad points of the game below and help compare the game with others out on the market good points gameplay the game defense ai is incredible
the cpu actually plays the passing lanes on defense
there are no cheap passes in the game
even inbounding the ball is a challange at timesgameplay flow is true to life
for instance if you have a hot player shooting lights out go to him hell hit most of his shots just like in real life
vice versa if the cpu has a hot player the cpu will also go to him good ai move by segain addition the flow of the game reflects team runs more than any other
if the cpu is scoring on a streat you must call a timeout or find a way to stop them or you will be blown out
and the same goes with your team as wellzone defenses
has a variety of zone defesnes that you can choose from that the other products out dont
this helps alot when you go up against perimieter shooting teamschallanging ai where you cannot really beat this game after a week
whenever i play and i have  wins in a row and think ive figured the game out the cpu makes adjustments and beats me
winning one game is a great satisfaction since the game is very difficultplayer ratings count in this game same as skill sets just like the real nbaoptions are good franchise mode is adequte and nba street court mode is fun to playcons goaltending bugs   there sometimes are goaltending calls when the ball is clearly below the rimfreethrows  free throws are too easy in this game with the analog sticks
the problem is that you can make free throws regardless of whos shooting
they seem to have forgotten to implement the different player ratings in the free throw codewhereas last years nbak did
so you can  be shaq who should be terrible in the free throw department but isnt once you figure out how to make free throwscompared to the other games on the market this is the best this year i have only played the ps version
nbalive doesnt come close is simulating a real nba game as nbak does
nbalive is more a simulationarcade which would probably be better suited for younger kids
nbak has a large learning curve when trying to be successful at the gamealright i had to change a few things after playing again last night
the rating dipped a bit from a  to a bit under a   just because some of the flaws i feel couldve been taken care of this year
these werent problems never before seen in a basketball video game ya know
that players retiring after  or  years in the league in franchise modething is getting really old really fast
then theres still the my guy will insist on standing out of bounds when im trying to inbound the ball to him one thats always been one of my favorites
overall this game is still pretty great
people want to compare it to games that its not even in the same category as like nba street
thats not fair
compare it to its true counterparts and it stands far far above
rent nba inside drive and tell me im wrong  even though that game has passed live as far as im concerned i played the dreamcast version the other day and i must admit theyre a bit different
the ps and xbox versions werent direct ports but the dc versions animations were nowhere nearly as smooth
outside of the shooting  the ps version looks kinda retarded i can say it cuz i own all  of these socalled nextgen systems and each one has its own little quirksi did find one other pet peeve the other night as i mentioned the draft will produce players with names made up of existing players names
this is good in one sense only the announcers can say the players name throughout gameplay
makes for some pretty funny combinations  like latrell olajuwon i liked that one
however the realism department took a major blow in my opinion when i drafted a white  small forward named rasheed abdulwahad
come on sega work with meguess now all we have to do is wait a few more days until the boxs version drops to see the final and best version on the nextgenest of the systems well seethe gameplay is slow and the background is very distracting and irritating
fishes shapes etc fly around the background and it kinda distracts you while you are trying to play
i rather have the tetris dx version for the color gameboy
another feature not added in this version is that there is no saved high scores
on the dx version all your high scores are saved so that you can try to beat it the next time you play
not recommended
sorryits not a bad game i just got a few days ago and i like the back rounds and  more games to it but wheres the high score at it says under ultra beat your high score but where is it atits alot differant then i thought it was going to be but hey its tetris its all around goodimagine my surprise when i dug into another version of the everloving and popular tetris franchise
this gba version released in  has some great soundtracks and background locales
some of the songs you may even find to be familiar because they were in earlier versions of tetris
just make sure that you choose the music at random while playing so that you dont get stuck with the same old boring songs
also you can play  different versions of tetris  popular hold down the l button when on the menu mode
 sticky fusion hotline square etcunfortunately the big drawback is that the fun may not last for tetris veterans
one of them is that the story mode from the gamecube version was entirely eliminated
second you only get to play each version in marathon or ultra mode
and there are  levels of difficulty
when i attempted to start out at level  on some of the modes it was virtually impossible to clear
however if some of you do manage to overcome that hurdle you should get a game message that congratulates you as a tetris masterso unless you are a tetris freak in a good way i would safely dismiss this particular title and stick to other versions of tetris
i will list some of them for you to download to your wii or nintendo dstetris gameboy and nestetris  gameboy nes and super nestetris  dr mario super nestetris plus gameboytetris blast gameboytetris dx gameboy colorthe new tetris nintendo the magical tetris challenge starring mickey mouse gameboy color and nintendo tetris attack gameboy and super nestetris ds nintendo dstetris party deluxe nintendo ds and nintendo wiitetris axis nintendo dsnba live  is a pretty good installment of the  year series
it plays similar to  but with some added bonuses like a decent franchise mode just like madden  that you one have to be careful about because all nba league regulations with the salary cap count here so be careful on who you sign because it could hurt you later
and in this mode after each season there is also a draft which is pretty cool as wellalso vast improvements have been made in the game as well
its a lot easier to hit alley oops now unlike  where the ball would go  above the intended players head
the annouce team is less annoying and they use a lot of players nicknames ex kevin garnett is called kg and michael olawakhandi is called the candy man
rebounding is no longer impossible
that was such a problem in  unless you actually had a decent rebounder or you made one
and now the computer actually plays against you unlike in the past all you had to do was head fake until they jumped and then you could just blow them outta the water
and of course michael jordan that is playable on a season or franchise modethere were some drawbacks too
the game got a little slower in pace
not by much but you can tell that it got a little slower
also when you trade for players make sure that you check each player on your team because i noticed that the computer no longer gives your new player a new number
thank goodness i noticed that because at one point i had  number s on my team
another thing that i liked better was that actual still pictures were used for each player ex player of the game and now the computerized image is substituted for thati still think that its a great game but if youre looking for a faster pace more challenging game check out nba k or nba k because youll be surprised how challenging those  are
either way it goes youll be picking a quality nba gamenba live  for the ps is an amazing game but it falls short of segas nba k
nba live  is a very fun but challenging game
the good  the graphics on this game waste nba ks  the gameplay is amazing and the dunks are so realistic vince carter dunks he does the undertheleg jam  offense is very easy to get used to  very uptodate rosters with current jerseys logos and shoe styles  createateam and createaplayer modes  franchise mode whhich lets you play multiple season with team with trades free agent signings and retirementsthe bad  very easy to hit  pointers form half court and beyond  bad announcing  very hard to steal the ball with too many fouls called  very low scoring games palying  minute quarters  very expensive at overall overall i give this  stars because it is a very fun game and very realistic
if you are a fan of the nba live series a reccommend this game but if you arent i say you sohuld buy nba k over this gameim soccer crazy and play a lot
this game is definetly cool once you master the passing its an incredible game
ive had it since it was first released and im still not tired of playing it
the graphics are excellent the commentating is pretty good and the modes are challengingthe downside is that with the new passing strategy you can no longer sweep up the field in a lighting fast counterattack you must aim at the player first otherwise you lose possesion pretty easily
this makes us play long ball tactics which arent as much fun and although you do score it kind of makes you feel you missing something without the quick on the ground passing between playersthe camera angels also leave quite a bit to be desired players are too small
i miss the fifa  action and on the ball camera angles where you could follow the curve of the ball or watch a bone crunching tackle or even dribble past players
in this one you cant really see much up closeit could be improved but for now it is fun to playyou might want to rent it first though the passing frustrates many would be fifa  lovershaving spent  years living in north carolina and not being a huge nascar fan now that i am in northen california i find the sport to be addictive
so is this game
it has everything that you are looking for
season mode sponsors challenges to keep sponsors points race and all the tracks and most of the drivers
if you think that driving  laps around an oval is boring try it with  other cars bumping grinding and passing you
it is very realistic as you have to pace yourself and slowly move up during a race
qualifying is important and you can tweak your car in a variety of ways set it up one way for qualifying and then change it for the race
if you just want to pick up this game and start racing you can do it
however if you want a more realistic kind of racing you can find that also
is this game perfect
no
however the squabbles i have with it are either so minor or you have to be such a diehard nascar fan to notice them
all in all this is one solid game
its fun to play and its realistic
i always race the full race at the track before the real drivers of nascar hold the race that way you can relate better to the television broadcast
i highly recommend this game to anyone who follows nascar even the tiniest bitthen by all means purchase syphon filter  but if you have never played the first  games of this series definitely start therethis review is kinda hard to write since if you are a fan of the series no one will talk you out of purchasing this one
however i do agree with some of the other reviewers here that sf is much easier than the first two installments and my rating is probably biased because i loved ampwhy is it easier
well in the first  games of the series you are often forced to use manual targeting and stealth to pick off enemies with head shots to avoid arousing suspicion
however in syphon filter  you can pretty much run through many of the levels with guns blazingunfortunately this removes much of the strategy of the game and forces many of the levels to become very similar
as a result the whole quotstealth spyassasinquot feel is lost
so while there are a few challenging boards and the missions are interesting i think some of the earlier levels ie the one with lian running around the city are much tougher than the last boardin short if you have amp go ahead and get this one
if not get sf firstit features one of the most challenging levels of the entire series gabe in stealth mode walking through the exhibit halli sure wish benoit sokal had done more video games
amerzone is a very nice game for the younger gamer
the puzzles are easy to moderate in difficulty you wont need the walkthrough
the game is divided into eight chapters
the only minor problem i had with it is that not all the puzzles need to be solved to move on to the next chapter
i hate untidy loose ends i love to do all the puzzles and want them appropriate to the plot
in addition in most adventure games the gamer is required to examine everything in order to give him clues to the reason for the upcoming puzzle
in amerzone you can overlook a scene that is causing a problem in the plot
then the puzzle that will resolve the problem in that particular scene does not make sense to the gamer because he doesnt see any connection until he blindly solves the puzzle which will then launch a cutscene that shows the reason for the puzzle to begin with
heres another thing if the character leaves an elevator on the top floor takes the staircase and goes to the bottom floor he should not be able to find the elevator on the bottom floor when he left it on the top floor
these are technical flaws that do not detract from the overall enjoyment and entertainment value of the game
i recommend amerzone to everybodya sweet little game thats not too hard and has some gorgeous graphics and sounds
acting and writing are also strong points though you shouldnt expect high logic
think myst as written by the french and youre not too far offamerzone was designed by the same guy who did syberia
if you loved that game this is sweet without being nearly as good
if you like amerzone syberia will knock your socks offnot on par with myst but still a very enjoyable game with some really nice graphics
the puzzles werent overly challenging and some were downright too easy but all fit in well with the story line
this is the type of game to play when you just want to sit quietly and do a quiet activity
the ambient music and the settings within the game tended to be very soothing
i know that i will probably be playing it again as soon as i have forgotten enough of the solutions or i may just play it through to look at the graphics and experience the technologya dying french explorer tells you to take a mysterious white egg back to its rightful tribe in the amerzone
so begins your fascinating journey across continents and time
amerzone is a short game but full of unique creatures modes of transportation and an original storyline based on benoit sokals comic books
the graphics are simply gorgeous
the amerzone journal contains pen and ink sketches of the flora and fauna of the amerzone watercolours of important scenes etc
it is like an interactive gallery but there are clues hidden in the notebook as wellmusic is scarce
sound effects are brilliant especially nature sounds birdcalls hoots and groans from unknown species of the amerzone
voice acting is soso although like myst you do not meet many people somewhere around four or five
there are some awkward translations from french to englishyou start your journey in the windswept rocky drab grey region of brittany the celtic region of france
the game will whisk you away to a south american country obviously modelled on brazil oppressed by a dictator
the natives have been exploited and their white egg was stolen by the aforementioned explorer
your mission is to return it to them
along the way you will discover that the explorerinventor left behind many interesting gadgets and modes of transportation
yes there are some flaws of logic floppy discs in the s
but this is a beautiful unique adventure game that always feels real
you have the chance to explore a lighthouse a sleepy hispanic village a native village an abandoned airplane hangar and bar complete with poster of casablanca on the wall a jungle and a volcanoif you are a fan of myst and exploration games this is for you
this is a slowpaced beginners game that is different from the rest both in visual style and in content
amerzone is worth the trip believe mewell amerzone is no masterpiece but its well worth the money
i doesnt coast much anyway
graphics are smooth and clear and the interface is easy to use
granted this game has borrowed a lot from riven myst but overall it makes for a nice game
amerzone is very simple so its not for those who are on the lookout for mindboggling puzzles
you wont find them in amerzone
the storyline is simple also follow in the footsteps of an explorer and make good his wrongdoings
i liked it but i could imagine that mystplayers miss the deeper layers
the atmosphere of the games to wich the sounds contribute a lot is great
from misty france to tropical amerzone its quite beautiful and enjoyable
it has plenty of humour too wich is lacking in some other adventuregames
the game is very short though even with four cds you could play it in a day or less
but if youre tired of rewandering the difficult routes as in riven and exile this makes for a nice easy change
its a good buyi actually enjoyed this game quite a bit and im not entirely sure why
it shared a number of traits that i have found quite annoying in other games but for some unknown reason they did not annoy me hereexcept for the initial quotchapterquot amerzone is very very linear
there is only one way you can go and one thing you can do at any given time
the linearity becomes more and more pronounced as the game progresses
this is partly due to the plotline in which you have to travel up a river making stops along the wayevery puzzle in the game except for one was either inventory based or a simple matter of flipping a switch
so gameplay was essentially a matter of looking around and seeing what you could pick up
solving the puzzles was very easy especially since you could simply keep trying various inventory items until one worked but this was never really necessary
there were one or two puzzles that i solved without knowing what i did or why
i think i would have liked it if there had been just a little more information about certain thingsthe first thing that struck me about amerzone was the beauty of the graphics particularly the watercolours in alexandres journal
this is a very restful game to the eyes
the human characters are very cartoony  almost resembling terry gilliam animations
this is not surprising as designer benoit s is a french cartoonist
weirdly though the cartoonyness of the characters didnt stand out horribly as it does in some other gamesthe ending is abrupt and a little lame
i think this might be a good game for a younger person who hasnt played an adventure game before and wants to see what its all about
i personally played amerzone at a stressful time in my life and found it soothing  i liked looking at the pretty pictures and the puzzles were merely a way to see more pretty pictures so i was kind of glad they were easy
if you want a challenge though this isnt the game you wantthis game can be played the brute force way
but it also offers specialized vessals for each of the three races in the game
as we have all come to learn about this style of game those who understand the units with special abilities will always prevail
using support units effectively and unit special abilities is of course a more difficult way to play because it meansleaning to understand these special units and the value of their special abilitiesmicro managing ships in battle in order to exploit these ships and their abilitiesdeveloping your ability to plan strategy around these special unitsin the end if you can do these things you will be unstoppable
but there in is the rub
for this to happen you need to have lots of game time so you rarely even begin to tap these potentials during the campaigns
it is only is multiplayer gameplay of strategy games that you can take the time to do these three things
and unfortnately this game did not succeed in this realmi liked the game
i thought it was a sleeper hit in its own right
but in the final analysis it found its way off my disk drive in favor of other newer challengeshail flaviusthis game does the dark knight justice
as batman you have an assortment of gadgets at your disposal including baterangs batgrapple an electric stun gun and restraint nets
those are just a few of them
batman is also able to use his cape as a sort of parachute to slow his decent if he falls from a high place
dont try to jump to the street off of a building though because the mission will be failed
the game was well thought up
the joker is killed early in the game
the next series of missions have to do with other villians who are trying to gain power such as mr freeze and poison ivy
as it turns out batman was just a pawn in the sick game of the joker
he returns near the end to reveal that batman has set up his whole scheme for him with out even knowing it
during the game you are able to drive the batmobile and batplane
this game is fun to play because it actually requires you to think like the caped crusader and figure out little things all through out the game
so if you think you might get frustrated with the game if you have to do a little bit of thinking then rent it first before buying it
other than that it is a good game for batman fans of all ages
have funhaving played most of the other batman games i can say definitely that this is the best of the lot
the cinematics are great and it game play isnt too hard to start out with
most games i own have the cheat codes nearby but this one is challenging without being impossible so theres no need for that yet
the games not perfect though
there are a few areas that are a little hard to figure out what youre supposed to be doing during one training session youre told to free fall and how to speed it up or slow it down but youre never told what youre falling afterits a training dummy thats falling faster than you by the way
plus sometimes batman breaks into a run when you just want to change positions on him which causes a few problems when navigating narrow ledges
i love the fact that with a push of a button you can immediately have the camera back behind you so its easy to see things if the camera angle gets freaky a little attribute that the new spider man game desperately needed
its a lot of fun and entertaining enough to keep the kids and their parents like me having fun for a long time
you definitely want to add this one to your collection at least until the next tomb raider comes along  or the sequel to this gamethe graphics special effects and dialog were incredible
crashed a lot in the batplane  the batmobile
would have enjoyed more episodes involving as joker puts it these wonderful toys even though the controls were a bit difficult to handle
only played the game through once because it was challenging but also frustrating
you could not save often
i hate spending even  minutes trying to complete a level only to find you were knocked out  have to start from the beginning of the level again
had to rely on the strategy guide to help me find one of the secret keys to unlock batmans steath powers that was tough  your perspective is off because of the camera angle
i thank the designers for allowing the game to save the key even if you could not trace your steps back across the floating crates
i had to start over again but at least i had the key
if you can tolerate the annoying camera angles  not being able to save often then youre going to have hours of fun playing this game
to the batmobileone of the best batman games before he went to the arkham asylum series
if you like superhero games you will like this gamethis game is great to play
it has lots of challenging levels and its great that they used the voices from the animated series
the only problem is that its very easy to get stuck on a levelbatman vengeance looks just like the cartoon including the voice actors and designs
this game takes place after the cancellation of the batman cartoon series
thats the latest incarnation  not the original series but the slimmer darker version of batman that incorporated designs from the movie
for those of you who didnt follow along batman lost robin and only had batgirl as a sidekickbatman vengeance starts out right
you are immediately thrust into play as batman slides down a slippery slope with an explosion behind him
the player doesnt have a whole lot to do  for the most part batmans going to make it regarless if batsy slides to the left or right  but it got me excited about the gamebatmans got a compelling plot including harley quinn poison ivy and mr freeze led by the joker voiced by quoti used to be luke skywalkerquot mark hamil
the joker maneuvers batman into release the right combination of chemicals in an effort to stop other villains
by manipulating batman into these situations he inadvertently mixes a dangerous concoction that threatens gothamthings look a bit different because the characters are rendered in three dimensions which is different from superman shadow of apocalips
so the characters look similar but theyre not quite rightbatman has a multitude of tools at his disposal including the batmobile and the batjet
batman vaults around the city with his batgrapple throws batarangs and uses his cloak as a defense as well as a means of gliding from place to place
which is important because batman fights on a lot of rooftops and ledges  death from falling happened a lotthe game takes itself seriously
joker harley and their cronies play for keeps
they shoot machineguns try to push you off ledges and otherwise kill you
true to the cartoon the bad guys fight dirty and its up to batman to use his formidable abilities to overcome his disadvantage  ya know not having a gunbatman is wellrendered but there were some graphic flaws
there is a quotsnap toquot function that allows you to recenter the camera facing the way batmans facing
this is less of a good use of the camera as it is a lazy fix to a problem that is problematic for too many games
unfortunately it snaps so quickly that sometimes i became disoriented by the new angle
additionally the camera is an object and will bounce off walls forcing itself literally inside bats head
which looks weird and doesnt help the perspective if batman is against a wallbatman also has some clipping bugs
in at least two different cases batman froze in space after getting trapped on the corner of a threedimensional object
then he couldnt leave it and i had to start over
batman vengeance only saves when you it wants you to
you have to finish the board to get to that point which makes for an either frustrating or easy experience depending on your level of skillby far the best part of the game is fighting my favorite villain mr freeze
sure enough freeze cannot be fought in handtohand combat if youve ever seen batman try youll understand and it requires some crafty maneuvering
there are a multitude of minigames that test your skill and your brains
although none are particularly hard they help break up the gameplay
there are puzzle games the aforementioned batmobile and batjet games and some other puzzlesthis is good because barring the unique villains including mr freezes eskimo chickies poison ivys rootmen and the jokers mimes there isnt too many bad guy types
the villains do in typical movie fashion stop shooting once batman engages one of their comrades in melee politely waiting until he goes down to resume firing
they also react to their surroundings listening to noises reacting to their allies socking one to bats they cheer and falling off ledges
yes you can actually knock someone off a building and watch them plunge to their death
now thats batmanoverall batman vengeance is an excellent balance of puzzles action and style
it was a great opportunity to return to the cartoon i enjoyed so muchi just purchased this game today and i dont know what to think because i dont want to play it until christmas but if i do play it it will take away from the suspense and come christmas i will be board with it
judging by what i have heard about it i think it will be a pretty good gameas much as i used to like batman when i was a kid and for the price you could not go wrongbatmans graphics are lovely sound nice story good
on the down side though batmans movements are stiff
he falls off of things to his death often
i find that frustrating considering todays new gaming technology
batmans weapons are imaginative but slow to utilize
the batgrappler is sometimes difficult to target
i love the batmobile and batplane
theyre fast and exciting to play withto get started ill come out and say im not a big batman fan
as a little kid i did however watch the show pretty much every time it was on and enjoyed it
now im guessing about  years later my interests have completely changed
and yes my favorite superhero is now spiderman 
but having the love of actionrpgadventure games i added this to my christmas list and sure enough i recieved it
the levels can be complex some more than others
in the first level you start out as the dark knight on what seems to be a normal nightly patrol
but as you go deeper into the story you realize he is looking for someone
as you continue his search you must adjust your eyes to the dark and sometimes annoyingly dark setting around you climb ladders glide from building to building and do many other things just like you do in pretty much every level
at the end of the level you stumble upon a bound  gagged woman
as you walk up to untie her a silent muffle comes from beneath her tapedshut mouth
you pull the tape off and a shrill scream cries its a trap
you grab the girl and get out of there as fast as you can and after that batmans new journey beginsthis game is just like the old series batman the animated series complete with batgirl the butler forget his name the joker mr freeze and many many others though strangely no boy wonder robin
too bad
it wouldve been cool if you could switch characters every other level or something like that but moving on
the combat controls are very easy to use but the exploringwalkingaround controls can be hard to use
but if youre a fan of batman or just looking for a good adventure game you should at least rent thisthis is one of those games that chances are the average consumer will rent
to be truthful as well unless you like the animated series as well you probably will pass this off as another action adventure game
to be truthful it isthe idea behind this is that they take  original episodes and try to make a game with at least  action levels and  training
there are a tremendouse amount of cinema sequences that sometimes helps explain whats going on and other times to make the game longerthe episodes involve  with the joker mr freeze and poison ivy
there are  sub levels built into each episode which ranges from jumping from roof to roof stealth chase scene boss fight and a training session
not all of these are present in every episode
for example episode  does not have a chase scene
meanwhile episode  you dont do the whole roof top jumpingthere is one thing that does kill it from getting this any higher camera problems
a primary example is in the first fight with the joker
he is on a wreaking ball trying to hit you as you dodge it whilem trying to hit him
the camera in this scene is so messed up you will be frustrated when you try and defeat himaside from that small flaw you have a pretty solid game
it has its problem but what game doesnt these daysi am sorry to have to say this but this sequel to the highly entertaining and original jade cocoon is not only totally unlike its predecessor but it is without doubt the single worst rpg that i have ever played
and i did finish the game because i didnt have the heart to stop playing the sequel to one of my favorite games without really giving it a chancewhy
first of all all of the features that made jade cocoon fun and interesting such as catching monsters and breeding them and coming up with totally new monsters breeding monsters to have a variety of available attacks within one elemental power and upgrading armor and weapons of the player character as the game progresses are totally absent from this game
instead of catching monsters and then breeding the monsters you catch to come up with a wide variety of different results you have certain divine beasts not minions anymore that you hatch from eggs and then you go and defeat a limited number of certain kalma evil divine beasts to get cocoons that you then pay a fee to merge with the beasts that you hatched from the eggs
this does not seem to affect the look of the beast or what it turns into at all
furthermore a beast can only have one ability in any one elemental area at a timeit cannot have more than one different earth special attack for examplealsoand this really bothers methe battle system is totally different from the battle system in the original jade cocoon
you cannot select which enemies your beasts attack when you are fighting if there are multiple enemies and your beasts can only use the type of elemental attack that they are aligned with on your beast amulet
if a beast is currently on the fire side of the amulet it can only do fire attacksand it can only have one fire attack
as if having tremendously frustrating battles werent enough these battles are constant
you are constantly getting into stupid very rarely avoidable little fights with the annoying little beasts that are roaming about everywhere
it is very repetetive monotonous and unsatisfying
also any battles that are supposed to be difficult are merely a matter of waiting until your enemys mp is totally drainedthen even the bosses are ridiculously simple to beatfinally there are two other major problems with this game
 the localization is not that great
characters say things that sound unnatural
for example they often say yow or yeow to express surprise when a more natural translation would be yikes or wow
this happens a lot in translating from japanese to english with this particular word as you will notice if you read any mangas
dont ask me why
 there is practically no plot
it is a common problem in current rpgs to have too many cutscenes but this game goes to the opposite extremethere are practically none
what little plot there is is simply uninterestingso if youre looking for a good monsterbreeding rpg play the original jade cocoon
i regret to say that i would not recommend this game to anyone especially fans of the original gameby popular belief a system will not reach phenomenastatus unless it gives rise to every kind of genre
it isnt a hamfisted deduction to assert that sonys unwavering playstation came out on top smashing the sega saturn and n into smithereens
their current powerhouse the ps has yet to be outperformed
thus its not another speculation to believe that sonys success is due on the behalf of a certain genre
whats now an essential ingredient for gaming diets everywhere rpgs determine fates
as the eagerlyawaited spectacle final fantasy x closes in ever so slight genkis jade cocoon  will clearly fill in the gap
released about the same time with squares goliath jade cocoon  struts the muscle of the ps harness and flexes a playable and enjoyable journeyill be quick about it pika pika is finished pokemon is at last
dead
now stop comparing it to jade cocoons awesome rudiments to that nauseating craze
genkis previous attempt was all about an extremely glossy monsterbreeding simulation and round two remains unchanged
where others flopped jc hypnotizes gamers inside an experience none can rival
modifying the previous monsterraising system plunking great innovations and keeping an authentic structure to its predecessor the followup soars well beyond the first
simply among the most enthused rpgs this year the d atmosphere sizes up a faintly tricky learningcurve that may overshadow the great depth this rpg endorsesthe first game ended when protagonist levant cleansed the forest from its wicked aggressors
with his village mending wounds from the ordeal the cocoon master gained immortality
centuries have dragged by and now levant is proven to be a critical guide to our newest hero
enter cafu an aspiring beast hunter
taken by the art of capturing and playing god with monsters cafu has unexpectedly been cursed as a demon himself
now time is his own future slayer slowly it bleeds out his human existence
branded as the seeker of the orbs cafu must scour uncertain mazes of woodland and snatch particular orbs to reclaim his true self
feral walls of wild beasts must be tamed grown bred brought onto battlefield as allies and go deeper in the elusive forest to prevent cafu from unavoidable doomrevamping all the nooks and crannies from the original there is still an elegant bag of surprises
once into the game levant bequeaths cafu with an amulet to control two friendly critters
in combat the amulet has a total of eight openings for your creatures to be planted on
leveling up cafus stats and his reputation at town earns additional slots
battle menubased is focused on cafu and the adjacent challenger who are surrounded with a ring of their own monsters
behaving like a rotating wheel if there is a hole in the shield of monsters both beast hunters are open to damage

dipping you in a series of engrossing fights jade cocoon  goes around the turnbased dudjcs chief point is its respectable monsterraising system
adding bucket loads of involvement you must perform a sequence of undertakings to modify collect and form a monster of your own zest
staying true with the concept of amalgamating two creatures to share parental traits jc also has the option to let newborns be bred endlessly
itll take continual experimenting to model  a flawless pedigree
collecting monster eggs require cafu to trek within the woods
featuring better prearranged areas you are to mostly penetrate giant plants and furrow for their keyspores
serving as keys to open subsequent accessible areas the exploration level is huge
yeah its linear but the direction in the game is still far better than the often puzzling original
customary procedures of moving between town to town gathering information and throwing a bargain of vast voyages genkis second effort is a virtual textbook on how to create a true rpg and monsterbreeding simulator done right
the graphical department is breathtaking
if you thought pikmin for the gamecube was the mind of an alcoholic jade cocoon  is the mind of a scifi writer
big isnt fit to express how large this rpg is extraordinarily gigantic is more like it
geared in a watertight execution of polygons the environment bolsters nicely with the spritebased characters
integrating animestyle characters the uncanny look on this game is mesmerizing
beaming with shady yet delicately dazzling eye candy the emphasis on creativity doesnt bog the game down
from house to towns from caves to neverending flora genki illustrates how much flair they can achieve graphically
with a technically advance facelift jcs soundtrack is just as rich
in tides of duel and all over between the tracks are relentless and tasteful
swallowed in a convincing d realm packed with  cutscenes and speaking in full english voiceovers i know where my fifty bucks wentlocalized with highquality text ubi soft was right to publish jc
its just an attachment of great gaming from beginning to end
heaving with a barrage of slicklooking animated characters and flowery special effects this title could be a tad bit of competition against the fearsome final fantasy x  its just that good
teasing you with two hundred different types of monsters to discipline and an easy to learn battle interface jade cocoon  has all the trappings of an rpg which shouldnt be missed under the holiday floodjade cocoon  wont win any awards for being a deep meaningful rpg
but it is a solid adventure thatll please fans of other creaturecatching games like monster rancher digimon or pokemonthe story starts in familiar territory for the genre with a young boy taking his first steps to become a master of monsters in this case a legendary beast hunter
the plot takes a refreshing twist into uncharted territory  you become possessed by an evil spirit and end up being hunted by the very hunters youre trying to joindespite the engaging storyline theres too much repetitive gameplay
most of the time is spent wandering through mazelike forests battling a few monsters and beast hunters until you find the key that gives you access to the next area
thats about it
its saving grace is that the environments look amazing
the games visuals are great anime style character designs and nastylooking beastsjc has a unique battle system
you surround yourself with monsters youve caught or bought and place them in a circle around you based on their elemental strengths
depending on which element is in front you can attack defend or heal
although it has a good amount of strategy it unfortunately lacks the ability to let you decide which attacks are used on specific members of the enemys party
you just send your front line into battle and hope they use an attack to do some damagejade cocoon  is a pretty fun monster catcher game
the repetitive environments lose points but its story strategic battle system and graphic style make up for thisthe gooda vast aray of monsters to train each with their own stlye and flare
a few old favorites make it to the ps  like levant mu and ra
the sweet knights are cute they remind me of misty and her sisters from pokemon
battle in tournaments
take up jobs like a bounty hunter
find a vast amount of different and unique items like sweet knights collectables
evolve durring a battle to give you the edgethe badmerging is possiable but you have to merge with a base set and it doesnt change their apperence all it does is cause them to revert back to their baby form
you cant capture any more you have to find or buy the eggs
the main character cant fight normaly like levant could
the beast amulate battle type in my opinion isnt as good as the original battle type from jade coccon one
no anime cut scene like the originals opening
your monster can only know two fighting techs at a timesummaryin my opinion this does not stand up to the original
this kid will always live in levants shadow in my eyesthe game was easy to install
its easy to learn nice interface
the graphics are great nice water effects
you can even see plankton if you wish
good sound effects and music
the first mission has cool techno music
the game will run in most windows formats
it did crash to my desktop a couple times
its a very fun game i would highly recommend it
only if you have a good enough system though
the system requirements are minimum and not recommended
if your system can handle it its well worth itthis game is addictive by its own right as the most fun video gamethe game is available for xbox  now at game stop preowned for its also available on ps and pstetris worlds is on ps and xbox its just tetrisif youre a flight simulator fan this joystick is really worth the money
it is well built with a nice feel and feedback effectswhen i was shopping for force feedback joysticks i was torn between this and the logitech quotdquot model
i have to admit the logic had a nicer design
the stick itself had a slightly better feel and the throw on the throttle control was longer and more precise
however i decided to go with the microsoft model because of the positive experience ive had with their force feedback steering wheel
just like the wheel the construction on the joystick is very solid
i expect this will stand up to a lot of abusethis stick is not without its drawbacks
first the throttle control is a bit small
i would like something a bit bigger and with a bit more resitance
second the force feedback is only activated when you are fully grasping the stick
this is actually a neat feature but can be annoying when you dont feel like quotproperlyquot holding the stickoverall this is a really great joystick which offer tremendous force feedback
the buttons are wellplaced and the ergonomic feel of the grip is outstanding
unlike many other sticks the sidewinder offers twisting rudder control which is key for many flight simulators and games such as mechwarriora couple of items really detract from the experience however
i found the throttle control to be far too short and far too quottouchyquot it offers very little resistance and its entirely too easy to blast yourself to full throttle without realizing
also the joystick is activated when you wrap your finger around it  theres a small beam that when interrupted brings the joystick online and upright
the problem here comes when i relax my grip at all  there are times when i want to stretch my fingers out in front of the stick and then suddenly i find that the stick has gone limp
argh
its also a really large piece of equipment simply because thats how things are with force feedback right now but it doesnt easily find space on my fairlycrowded deskdespite these detractions its still an excellent device overall
there are  buttons three on the top of the stick four on the base ahead of the throttle control plus the trigger and a quothatquot control
it comes with good software which includes sample force feedback settings  this was the first force feedback stick ive owned and running it through the automated feedbacks was huge fun
so great piece of ms hardware with a few defects only one of which i find hugely detrimental the grip light
two thumbs upi have had this joystick for a number of years and it has performed well
from time to time i have had issues with installing this on other operating systems but because it is so old the chance for it being recognized is fairly highinstallation just install the software and then plug it in
most games recognize it right awayforce feedback this is a very strong force feedback joystick
it can feel like arm wrestling when you are flying a plane and are pulling off high g maneuversoverall great joystickthanks for reading my reviewwanting a controller for racing and flight sim games i purchased the microsoft sidewinder force feedback  joystick
the first thing i noticed is that it seems to be well made
it is quite heavy but not too heavy to hold
the force feedback is the  reason anyone would buy this and this feature varies from game to game
on some games it felt totally unnecessary and didnt add anything to the game
on others it complimented it nicely
the feedback response seems to be strong on this controlleri would recommend this controller to anyone that is really into gaming
otherwise forgo the feedback and just get a regular joystick
if you play console type games or shooters get a gamepadone thing to note  whatever you do  do not lose the cd that comes with this
it contains the drivers needed to install this joystick
microsoft does not have them on its website
windows xp will not autodetect and install the joystickto me this game was fun for awhile but then it started to get hardi know i knowthats not a reason to quit but to me it isbut still good gamemy  yr old loves the show sponge bob so i bought the game for him but its not really for  year old unless they are excellent game players my son couldnt get past the first screen
you have to collect spatulas catch jelly fish  try not to get hit by yellow fish  other enemies all at the sametime
you really need to know how to use the controller before playing this game
my  yr old didnt like playing but i love the game
i ended up playing and he enjoyed watching sponge bob meet barnacle man
i hate games that you need a book  internet to figure out like tomb raiders this one is easy but challenging too
im glad i bought it was so much fun to play and when my son gets better at the controller im sure it will be his favorite toohoshigami is a good looking rpg tactical game
i enjoyed the many side quests and all the towers
it took well over  hours to complete them all
however i can honestly say that after all that i cant remember anything about the storyline what so ever
its only been two weeks since i finished this game and i remember very little of the plot
i enjoyed defeating the dungeons finding weapons and using the well designed coin system which was fun
if you can play strictly to enjoy the battle maps and side goodies i highly advise this title however the story is lacking and forgettablethis is probably the best wheel for pss gt but the price bites and unless you are some super hardcore racer i dont think you will play it for too long before you get sick of it
especially if you already beat gt game using a controllermega man x was such a huge success that capcom had to continue the spin off mega man series with a sequel
and so they did with the release of mega man x for the super nes in  touting a brand new graphics chip specifically made for the game itself capcom made sure that the fun continued with this second entry
while in some ways x was better than the first one but overall its just more of the same and thats a good thing
mega man x finds mega man x rushing to a disturbance at an old abandoned robot factory to restore order there
little did he realize that it was a trap meant for him and this is where the game starts out
after you get to the end you face off against a giant robot
beat him to see the rest of the intro
there are  robots looking to resurrect zero who sacrificed himself near the end of the first game
why they want to do this is unknown to x but they are behind the new resistance of robots so you must defeat the new xhunters and make your way to the end to find out whats going on
everything from the first game returns including the same premise you choose from  stages to explore and defeat the boss
collect its weapon and you can use it against enemies and other hunter bosses
the password system returns from the first game and this is how you save your progress
new to this game is the allnew themed stages the side quest which you may or may not choose to complete collecting zeros old partsand thanks to the graphics chip all new special effects and graphical touchesthe pros graphically speaking it is better than mega man x youre in for a treat as to what you can see this time
the story is given more focus this time and you see just how the  secret robots play a significant role in the game
the overall presentation is good the music is just as good to listen to and the sound effects do their job once again
the controls are the same as the last game so whether you played the first one or not you will have no problems with it
discovering the games secret bonuses are cool as well secret capsule that gives x a new addon reminiscent of street fighter and a  player vs mode accessed by inputting a certain code
having the option to face off against the  secret robots to acquire zeros parts actually impacts the game later on
if you beat them you get his parts but if you ignore them youll face off against zero near the end of the game
and of course its good to have the password system come back because its a longer game and much harder than mega man x wasthe cons the music isnt better than the memorable tracks you heard in mega man x the games difficulty is more brutal thanks to the  secret robots
if you fight them for zeros parts prepare for grueling matches and then you fight them all over again later on in the game
the games difficulty curve does the reverse of what happened in mega man x in x it drops the minute you fight sigma yes hes back
hes a complete joke this time compared to the first game and while the ending in mm x was awesome this games ending is not as spectacularwhile the game is insanely hard but drops the ball at the last fight with sigma and has an ending that doesnt compare to the end of mega man x mega man x was still a sequel worth playing through
it had everything else going for it and will please all mega man x fans
its hard to track this game down so you will have to settle with either a used copy or searching for the mega man x anniversary collection for the psgc
i suggest for those who havent played this game yet make sure to play mega man x first
i recommend this game to all mega man fansif youve played the original mega man series and the first mmx you should be familiar with the way the game is played as the formula continues like this pretty much
eight bosses a few other bosses gained weapons and so on and so forth
a decent gameafter the sonic storm that was mega man x there had to be more and in now traditional capcom form a sequel came to be
so one would ask does x have what it takes to usurp the mighty x
wellnot reallybut not by its own faults
x was just such an amazing outtanowhere title that is damned hard to dethrone and as it stands x should just be considered the next awesome chapter in an equally awesome franchise
x for what its worth kept the same elements afloat heart tanks subtanks armor capsules ride armor only really coming alive by way of prebit graphic effects great level designs the introduction of the land speeder bike and powerful bosses and weapons not to mention the introduction of the xhunter subbosses and the return of the unstoppable sigma but in the end x only really treaded water
still this is a strong title that belongs in the higher echelon of mega mandomwhat a great game
there are plenty of cars to unlock and you can drive around springfield
sure its a crazy taxi ripoff but its better than that game because it has the simpsons
i love this game and i hope to see an expansion possibly on the pssimply buy it great for any simpsons fanok this is a total copy of crazy taxi the only difference is you play as simpsons characters go through springfield locations and pick up simpsons characters
there is a lot more variety in this then crazy taxi but i give the edge to taxi because of the music and graphics which are both superior to that of these
as a fan of the simpsons and crazy taxi i reccomend that fans of either or both check this outthe game is pretty nice
although it does have its flaws it is nice
so theres four modes road rage sunday drive head to head unlockable and mission mode
in road rage you beat the clock to pickup and drive passengers to their destinations
mainly after the time does go out it goes to some menu screen and it tells you how you drove such as my usual types of driving levels are reckless  destructive then it calculates how much money you received the main reason it does that is to reach a goal then you get to either unlock a starting location or the cardriver of your choice
in sunday drive its about the same concept but no timing or money calculation
just you go your own pace and you can drive people or not its your choice
mission mode is a pain in the butt because you end up screaming at your tv half the time because the guy drives like cm off of what you need to get and then times up
large pissers are like in road rage mode youre right on location but the car wont brake
even though you pressed square really hard
sometimes the way people talk to you in the game is hilarious
but thats about iti loved the simpsons so i played this and was broed in  minsthe only good thing in this game is the charctersthe graphics arent great either
the game my look great but dont full in to the same trap i didwhen you play this game it might be hard at first but if you keep playing it it will be fun and pretty easythis game is way better then crazy taxi by it having the simpsons charactors being their same old funny selfs and crazy taxi it is so hard to pass a levelso buy road rage insteadthis will definitely not be the deepest game you will ever play
however if you are a huge simpsons fan this game is definitely worth the investment
it is basically a shameful copy of crazy taxi with simpsons characters
you drive around town as one of  playable characters pick up passengers follow the arrow to their destination and drop them off before the time expires to earn money
if the trip timer reaches zero the passengers becomes impatient and jumps out of the car
if your overall time runs out then the game is overthe best thing about simpsons road rage is that it is true to the show
the environments look exactly like they do on tv
you will see the simpsons home the school the kwikemart the church and the retirement castle just to name a few recognizable locations
the characters voices also sound authentic as they quote familiar lines from the show
there are  playable characters actually  since there are two versions of homer and two of moe including the entire simpsons family ned flanders professor frink otto groundskeeper willie snake apu chief wiggum and krusty the klown
they all have their own vehicles to fit their personalities andor occupations
there are also several other unplayable characters who appear as passengers like milhouse ralph wiggum hans moleman and principal skinner
then there are the six huge environments
you can cruise through the evergreen terrace neighborhood the entertainment district springfield dam the nuclear power plant downtown or the springfield mountainsthere are four driving modes to play around with
the meat of the game is in road rage mode which is the taxi mode i explained before
you must play this over and over and over in order to earn money to unlock characters and neighborhoods
every time you play your money gets added to a cumulative total
every time that total reaches a predetermined amount     and so on you can choose whether to unlock another character or another neighborhoodthe other game modes include sunday drive where you can drive around any of the unlocked neighborhoods and get to know the terrain and find shortcuts
there is also a mission mode which includes ten missions usually involving knocking over a certain number of street signs light posts mascots etc that you may or may not want to bother playing through especially since the game takes a long time to reload itself every time you restart or fail the mission
finally there is a two player multiplayer mode where the two players are in a race to pick up each passenger
once the passenger is picked up the other player can steal the passenger by bumping into the car with the passenger in it
whoever ends up dropping off the passenger gets the money and the first person to earn a set amount of money wins the gameof course there will always be some negatives to every game and this one is no exception
first the loading times are almost unbearable
there is no such thing as a quick restart
second the game can get repetitive very quickly
it starts to feel like a chore playing game after game after game trying to add more money to your pot so you can unlock the other characters
the change in environment can help some but some of the neighborhoods have huge learning curves
it could take a lot of exploring before you get used to some of the environments
and when you are trying to add money to your pot it is hard to waste a game earning only  in springfield dam when you know you could earn around  a game in evergreen terrace
third i cannot decide whether the dialogue in the game is annoying or entertaining
each passenger has a number of lines that they might say when they jump in your car and your character has a number of lines that they will say as a reply
however more often than not the two lines do not match up at all and it sounds like a pretty random conversationnegatives aside this is a pretty simple game that you can always go back to when you have nothing better to do
it is not likely to keep you occupied for hours at a time but for any simpsons fan this is a pretty entertaining gamethis game is ok it gets to hard
it starts off easy because you need  coins to get each car or level but after a while you need  coins to get something
if you have simpsons hit and run you shouldnt get road rage because hit and run is  times betternow that the price is lowered on this classic title all simpsons fans should add this to their collection
sure it has interminable load times and the draw in is annoying but nothing beats coming home from a busy day at work and just sitting back and driving homer krusty and prof frink around springfield
there are the amusing missions and the sunday drive mode to learn each level but then you can get comfy and shut off the logical part of your brain and just have fun dropping of the citizens of springfield for cash
you will find yourself naturally driving the streets as if you were watching the cartoon
everything gets to seem so familiarits the next best thing to being in springfieldso pack your bags pop in the game and overlook all of the annoying shortcomings and youll find one heckuva fun game this game is really fun
its a lot like crazy taxi in that you drive around town picking up fares all recognizable citizens of springfield and taking them to their destinations
the faster you get there the more  you makeits easy to play and there are a ton of shortcuts to explore making the replay value high
theres also a twoplayer mode where you try to make more money than your opponent
there are also enough inside jokes to keep fans of the show laughing
the negatives are few compared to the positives long load times a short boring mission mode and a few glitches where you can get stuck in the sceneryduoh how could ea make a simpsonsroad rage be only 
thats obserdthis game is worth the full simpsons road rage is a lot of fun to play its a lot like crazy taxi with an added simpsons zing
you can play as just about every simpsons character go just about anywhere in springfieldoverviewfun  a lot of fun to play stinks that there is only a couple levelsgameplay  pretty simple drive stop dropoffgraphics  simple what is there to make graphicdifficulty way too easyoverall this game is a lot of ufn but its not great
there is loads of room for improvement but overall this is a fun game to playths simpsons finally on ps
this game rocks
a whole slew of characters a great story line real character voices and tons more
this game is exactly like crazy taxi except ten times better
the only reason it got  stars is because of the slow loading times
other than that it is awesomeok this game is really fun
you get to drop your simpsons people off and then get paid
when you reach a certain limit  you get another level or personcar
for more info go to crazy taxi its the same thing
the only bad thing bad graphics
its toatally not realistic at all you crash through trees run people over and they tumble down the road like a newspaper and then get back up and start walking
but its fun and its mad cheap so buy itthis is a fun game but its the same thing as crazy taxi just with simpsons characters
i do reccomend this to any simpson fan but someone who just wants to play a game go with crazy taxia crazy taxi clone with the simpsons
good
almost
the simpsons road rage needs more stuff to make it interesting
bigger levels more characters etc
i found more fun running over ned flanders that anything else
an okay gamethis game is really intriguing
it has the feel of a mario world but expands beyond that to include difficult puzzle solving
you have to herd various creatures into their pens
simple but far from easy
the land scape is varied and requires some thinking just to get from point a to point b the animals themselves all have different attributes which you must learn in order to herd them
some will eat others some can fly some can swim etcthe major draw back is the camera angles are terrible  sometimes you will have no idea of where you are and what is chasing youthe graphics are not stellar  truly a first generation game
they are pretty humorous however
lots of little details
the landscape is especially nice to look atall in all it is clever hard fun
i would recommend iti was really excited when i heard tony hawk pro skater  was coming out and so i eagerly preordered a copy of the game
when i played it i noticed that it wasnt a great game
it was good but they should have made it a lot better
the graphics had huge glitches and it really annoyed me and although you could play it across the internet it hasnt had much of improvement
it has had a bit but not much
if i were you i would definitely buy it if you dont have any of the previous two versions and if you have one or both of them i still probably would but if youre not sure wheather to buy this or something else i would maybe think about buying something else but it is a great game and if you have the chance to i would buy itthis game was made over  year ago
it has average graphics nothing to show off here
however the gameplay more than makes up for the visual dissapoinment
you can create your own skatepark and play throughout the many premade levels
if you beat certain levels you can select new skateboards
overall this is a great gamethere is no question that the tony hawk series is quality gaming
i have owned all the iterations on the playstationps
my concern is this arent these games all exactly alike
the biggest advance to the actual game aside from the move to the ps was the level editor added to thps
otherwise the gameplay and features havent changed since the first game
none of these facts keeps reviewers from granting perfect scores to every successive release
dont get me wrongi love these games and i play them and they deserve to be popular
but are they perfect
no
are they the best games ever made
most assuredly not
just what are these game reviewers comparing thps to
other skateboard games
games from every genre
games on the same system
i guess my point is that just like final fantasy and resident evil and as we will see metal gear games thps games get an unfair advantage because of the brand name not the merit soley based on gameplaynow that youve read my tirade go out and buy thps
its greati seriously thought this game was only going to be for kids that skate sorry i hung up my skateboard almost  years ago and that it wasnt going to be challenging this is starting to be a growing trend with me because i was wrong
this was an excellent game and it truly deserves some recognition throughout all of the other great games that are on the psthe graphics are excellent very tight clean and very detailed
the gameplay is great and its never really the same game twice and the soundtrack is just great
perfect skater music and it actually flows with the game unlike how pharaoh monk did a song for john madden seriosly get this game
i was turned from a skeptic to a fan overnight
im definately waiting for the next installment of this seriestony hawks pro skater  is not fun after you have played tony hawks pro skater  tony hawks underground or tony hawks underground  because in the new ones your not timed untill you pick a goal
in tony hawks pro skater  you timed from the begining and you have to do something in about  minutes
unless you love tony hawk games dont buy this
save your moneythis is an awesome game
i would recomend it to anyone anyone so buy it already
hope you love this game as much as i didthe most recent addition to the tony hawk series adds a fair number of changes the most visible being the addition of the revert and the ability to play onlinetheres not much to say about the revert that hasnt already been said
its cool and does make your combos that much more absurd
from an aesthetic standpoint its addition is nice because lip tricks are a lot more feasible for inclusion into combosthe online play seems to make of break this game for many reviewers
ive seen very few negative reviews which really address the online play so take that for what you will
its dirt simple to set up the linksys adapter works like a charm and the network settings configuration is both easy and surprisingly powerful
the actual gameplay is impressive as its very playable over a k modem
there are a few minor problems that make you wish for software updates though
the limit of  players is slightly annoying though more would only make sense on the large levels
more irritating is the fact that the person running the server has to manually start each game making dedicated game servers unfeasible
other problems come up such as the fact that you cant use created parks online you cant turn off dumping upon collision with other players and stock levels that were poorly designed for multiplayer
however all of that is outweighed by the fact that its just a lot of fun to play onlinenow that the two biggies are out of the way theres still a lot of minor tweaks to the gameplay
the first thing most people will notice is that the balance system is a bit more difficult
it takes some getting used to but skilled players will have no trouble with it after an hour or two
flatland tricks are a cool addition though they get awfully annoying online
ollieless transitions between tricks for grinding and lip tricks are a nice touch allowing for some cool sequences going from  grind to nose grind to nosebluntslide to noseslide to crooked grind and so onthe levels are actually generally better than those from thps
none of the levels are as bad as the school ii or new york from thps which while fun had very little flow and the skater island and cruise ship levels are really great
the airport is a complete throwback to the mall in thps which inspired much nostalgia plus airport is a better level
foundry is a fairly good first level though i prefer the simplicity of the hangar from  from thps warehouse roswell and burnside are all unlockable in thps
i never particularly liked burnside in fact i really disliked it and i dont understand why they didnt add the first school or san francisco but warehouse and roswell are welcome additions
with so much space available on the disc i really wish they would just release a game with all of the levels on it i dont count thps x for xbox
id love to play minneapolis or chicago from thps or venice beach from thps with this enginein short while theres a lot of good things about thps its clear they dont have all the kinks worked out
if you dont mind shelling out an extra  for a usb ethernet adapter and plan on another  for a usb keyboard you really should check out the online play because its a lot of fun
if youre a fan of the series you might appreciate the engine tweaks but theyre really not that hugethis game is a logical extension of the tony hawk franchise and it amazinly finds a way to be superior to its younger brother tony hawk  the games graphics are above average and the framerate is very consistent
the control scheme is very useful for performing hundreds of different tricks
the player roster is impressive and the amount of unlockable characters in this game serve to highlight this fact
the sound is great as well blitzkrieg pop is one of the highlights of the sound track
the game also contains an unfathomable amount of extras to unlock and that carries the replay value a long ways
of course the excellent multiplayer mode is what gives the game the most replay value of all especially considering the fact that there is a createapark mode for the more creative gamerhowever this game becomes very easy much too quickly and beating the game with other characters becomes a chore rather than a mission
also it is unfortunate that activision decided to leave out a gap checklistdespite these shortcomings tony hawk  is a valuable addition to any gamers librarywhy are there so many reviews for a product that isnt on the market
and why are they all along the lines of quotthis is the best game
i love tony hawk
im a freakin idiotquot
now i do believe that this is a good game it sticks to the thps formula while adding the pss power and new elements in the the revert
the online mode might be good and from what i have seen it will be as good as those morons tell you
i know that one reviewer thought it was too similar to the other two
they might of been right who knowsjust dont review products you havent playedpretty much everything is great on this game
the only thing wrong is the fact that there is a time limit and freeskating isnt that much fun
but when you do the goals and the way the characters are is awesome
the best part of the game in my opinion is the music
this game is the whole reason why im a huge fan of afi and nofxalthough some may say that this game is just more of the same i have to disagree
although all the controls and most of the characters are the same this game has changed a lot from the original
objectives such as quotget chuck unstuckquot are hilarious new additions that were never on any of the other games
i especially like the fact that chuck runs around complaining about his tounge no matter how many times you play the level and no matter how many times you run poor chuck over because he got in your way dont you think chuck should have learned to get out of the way
oh well poor chuckace combat  is a flight combat simulator in which you take part in a ficitonal world war as a fighter pilot on the side of the isaf independent states allied forces
at the beginning of the game your enemy is the shadowy and mysterious erusians who have taken over the entire continent except for one small island off the northeast coast known as northpoint
the story is narrated from the viewpoint of an unnamed young boy living in a city conquered and occupied by the erusians and his tales of admiration for an erusian pilot known only as yellow 
the narratives are accompanied by animated stills which really flesh out the story and make it interesting
as the story progresses the boy narrator relates how yellow  hopes to meet his equal in air combat one day and remarks about a promising enemy pilot
the narrative of the story is undoubtedly influenced by wwesque narratives such as empire of the sun and such  and there are eerie similarities to ww as well a continent occupied by a oppressive fascist enemy the allied forces isolated to a small island off the coast of the continent a desperate invasion to gain a toehold back to the continent singing in the streets of liberated towns and a final cataclysmic battle at the gates of the enemys capital cityas far as the gameplay you can control over  different aircraft american soviet and nato
your initial plane is the obsolescent vietnamera f phantom but as you complete missions you are credited with money which you can use to buy more advanced airplanes and equipment
of course the more advanced planes cost more and you will occasionally have to sell one or two of your older models but it is money wellspentunfortunately it is not a highly realistic sim in that you do not control takeoffs and landings they are done for you and theres no concern over fuel state
also each and every plane holds dozens and dozens of missles while in real life most fighter aircraft carry only about six to eight or even less
it would have been better if your squadron mates were more capable of killing enemies on their own instead of your character shooting down scores of enemies in each engagement
in real life a fighter pilot is lucky if he can successfully shoot down even one enemy aircraft in a given engagement
however for fun factor this title is way up there
i recommend it with  starsthis game has great attention to detail and is a blast to play
the graphics are good looking and realistic the textures are superb right up to subtle weathering
the backgrounds are beautifully rendered there are realistic clouds snowflakes and raindrops
the overhead views of the cityscapes are like looking at satellite photos
the environments are enormous and allow for a lot of maneuvering during dogfights
the effects are realistic alsothere are plenty of planes to choose from and you collect money fast enough to move up to better planes quickly
i like the fact that you can continue from one skill level to the next carrying over planes and money
there are a few missions where one type of plane works better than another might but for the most part youre free to pick your favorite and use it all you want
ive always been a fan of the a warthog and its fun to fly with the maverick misslesthe game isnt extremely difficult and i was able to beat the normal mode in a few days and the hard level in a day
the hardest part was meeting some of the time limits but once you do a mission a few times youre able to come up with a strategy to beat the time
if i have one complaint its probably that the game is short but there is so much replayability its not much of an issuethe story line is a good one
the cutaway scenes are done like a story board and the art is well done
i like the point of view the story is told through
it builds suspense and slowly comes together over the whole game
its one of the few game storylines ive really enjoyedthis game was a great timethis may seem hasty to write but i cant see another game getting better than this
the only other flight game i played was quottop gunquot and that was a joke so dont be enticed by the title
if the images of speeding in a jet blowing up ground sites and dog fighting other aces then ace combat is it
i gave it only  stars because it took me awhile to get used to turning the jet i crashed several times but once i understood how to control it i became a quotspeedfreakquot
i would be flying so fast that i would launch  two missiles while chasing the enemy and they would explode after i passed them up
the other reason why i gave this only  stars is that maybe there is a possibility that there might be a better flight game than thisbut i doubt it
uh theyre calling me ltmobius  engagegtthis game is a lot of fun
lots of dogfighting and ground targets to destroy along with some tricky missions
replays are cool but ingame movies are cheesy and the gun sound fx are completely unsatisfying
the programmers might argue the sounds are true to life but im much more interested in high drama for a more entertaining experience
but other than that i liked the controls the various planes and the different weaponry
im not entirely sure the buy and sell options for planes and weapons is necessaryi havent had the chance to play player and i bet thatd be great fun
if youre someone who sits and plays games for a weekend straight pick this up used or as a rental
its  missions offer under  hours of gameplay id guess playing the same mission over and over doesnt counti dont play alot of plane games but with the cool comrcails i couldnt resest
im going to join the navy when im old enough to fly fs but for now im stickin to the games for trianing
the graphics are great game play isnt hard you can buy planes and weapondry basicly bombs for your plane which isnt hard to get
the game is alittle tough but once you beat the hard parts your find from there
the only thing i cant get by is the stuipid anime clips between missions since anime has always been pritty stuipid
over all this is a must have for all yu fighter jet goers out therethis game is so much fun
i highly recommend it
it doesnt take too long to complete
it only took me about  weekends off and on to finish
unlocking the different planes and color schemes is way cool
but be sure to pick the right plane for the right mission
i remember trying some missions and they were tough until i picked the right plane with the right weapons
i recommend getting an online walkthrough in order to purchase the best planes for each mission in the first run through
you can always buy the other planes later
so if you enjoy flying games and war games then you will love this because you get both in one
have funthis game is pretty good its graphics and gameplay is great this game is tons better than top gunbest airplane game your going to find  out there if your looking for a war airplane game the only bad  thing is it can get boring after two weekswhen i first started playing ace combat  i was a little disappointed as it seemed to be just a quotsupedupquot of version of the earlier ace combat games
but as i got deeper into the missions i found out it was much much more
now im totally hooked on it starting my third time through the missions
yes its that much funi cant say enough about the graphics they are just outstanding
the control scheme is easy to master and you can be up and running in no time at all
the levels load quickly so theres not a lot of wasted time waiting to play a level
the sound is also outstandingthis game has varying degrees of difficulty and is beatable fairly quickly in the easy mode but you can go through and play it on one of the harder settings and have just as much fun the second time around especially when you use different types of aircraft and weaponsyoull also have the option actually taking off and landing in some of the missions including the carrier based missions
you get a chance to refuel and rearm and even switch weapons to fight different kinds of enemies
many of the missions require you to complete land based objectives only to have objectives added that include dogfightsthis a great game in reality i give it  stars but since thats not an option i chose  stars
if you love flight combat simulators you will not be disappointedthis is one of the best flight simulators every time you pass a mission you get money to buy more planes and jets and weapons to put on the aircrafts
there air different aircraft for different missions and even some hidden aircraft but i havent gotten those yet
the graphics for the plains are awesome but for the rest of the game they arent
the buildings i guess kind of resemble buildings and the tanks well i just trusted my radar and missile guidance system to help me find thosethe story to the game is cool i think it would be world war  or what world war  would look like if it were now a days
it takes your through the start of the war and into the finish of the war
one cool thing about the game is that every time you complete a mission your reputation goes up and you over here enemy radio saying the ribbon fighter your character is above them
so basically you feared by the enemy and loved by your troopsthe game is a really cool i recommend itwhenever a dogfighting sim comes to mind i always have to think back to the old days on the nintendo bit when i first tried out top gun
i was a force to be reckoned withat least for the first level
i made my way through all those bogeys with ease and then i was given the order to land
beads of sweat rolled down my face a lump grew in my throatand you can bet a steak dinner i nose dived my multimillion dollar f into the carrier again and again
sure it may be a fossil of a game by now but i always had to applaud it for adding that extra depth of realism by requiring landings even though i sucked at iti must admit i never got a chance to try the very popular ace combat  i instead tried the obsolete air combat that was bad enough to make me hold back from trying other flight games for playstation
so when ace combat  made its way into a used cd store it didnt take long to find its way it jobes sticky fingers
after playing through it now three times trying out all of the ships and other modes i can say without a doubt in my mind this is the best dog fighting game ive ever played
playing this one makes all others seem like toys in a discount rack ace combat  is like a dream this game cant be realinstead of shoving no chance in hell levels and monstrous mechanical enemies like air force delta down players throats to try and make an electrifying game during every second
ace combat  sticks to what its really about dog fighting
sure there are multiple airtoground levels but when youre not putting towers or satellite dishes in your sights youre probably cranking your plane as sharp as it can turn to avoid one of a missile on your sixflight combat here is no joke just as it should be
you take two hits maybe even one perfect one and its curtains
just like in reallife piloting half of your time is going to be dodging missiles from bogeys who will stick on you like a bum on a bologna sandwich
no enemy can be deemed irrelevant here its when you pass that missed sam site that youll have immediate missile lock so kiss targeting any other enemies goodbye because  youre times going to be spent pulling gforce blackouts to avoid missiles
over the course of  missions youll also encounter an elite group of fighters called yellow squadron and going up against these pilots manages to create a tense heat as you fight for a perfect missile lock while avoiding a yellow already on your tailanother point i have to bring into view is the storyline granted there are no cgis or movie clips between missions
instead the story is told through still hand drawn pictures and is so well written that it makes even some of the rpgs stories look like creative writing in kindergarten
ace combat s story isnt a crazed general hellbent on world domination but in fact a superbly written narrative about the recollections of a young boy during a war who befriends an enigmatic pilot yellow  who strives during the war to find a worthy opponent and you are that opponent he speaks of during the storyboards
the war is between the eursians and the allies who fight over a devious weapon originally designed to shoot down meteors falling to earth called stone hedgethe story not only is a huge and creative departure from your everyday gaming stories but also adds in a smart commentary on trials and tribulations of those involved in war as well
it also doesnt hurt that the opening moments of the final level is one of the greatest cinema scenes in gaming history i wont spoil it but coming from a movie reviewer for over  years i can say it even rivals the silver screens momentsace combat  is one by far this years biggest sleeper hit
i had no idea of what to expect when i purchased it and what i found was a dog fighting paradise
flight simulator fan or not i still recommend this one highly to all ps owners after playing through it  times and already on my sixth i still cant find anything bad about this game and believe me that truly means that this game is something special
one of s  best games another must have title right alongside metal gear solid  and grand theft auto this is a great game
for a  game it has great grafics
 missles blow your plane up
dont listen to the guy who said the planes have bad armor because real planes blow up after  missle
if you like combat flight simulators you will probably like ace combat i liked playing ace combat   the problems i had the story never made since to me
i believe they could have made a better story and made it more of a movie not a cartoon
also the flying model is the same for all the planes
the sound is very good and the eye candy is off the charts
i like watching the replays but what makes this game lack is the planes being the same
there is no way that that an f can take on an f in close combat
the f falcon would out maneuver the f phantom with the pilot not breaking a sweat
playing with two people is fun but you can not change the view youre stuck with one view for the two player missions
the combat is easy i have never been shot down buy a computer enemy even with the ai turned all the way up to hard
the only time i lost a mission was when i smacked into the ground or in a wall
dodging the enemy missiles are so easy that you will never have to worry about being hit by one
all in all i gave the game a  only because its fun playing being an arcade type flying game
but if youre looking for realism
then stick with flying computer flying sims because this game is nothing more than a arcade game that you can play for  centsthis game is truly excellent it far outdoes any of the flight combat sims to date
first the graphics and animation are right on par except for a little blurriness on the terrain when you get up close but thats because the hardware still has some limitations
after all when you are climbing to  feet and look out the side of your cockpit you are seeing vast expanses of some very photorealistic terrain
add to those graphics an exciting collection of real existing planes well most of them secret paint schemes that you can win by shooting down enemy aces excellent sounds including ambient speech coming to your headset etc and youve got one heck of a great game
the story seems to be a blend of reminiscence of the occupation of japan during wwii and a prediction of air combat for the futurethe only complaint i can think of though is a pretty big one resulting in a onestar shortage why all the missiles
i know for a fact that current fs and fs can not carry upwards of  missiles on their bodies thats ridiculous and it gives you very little ammo for your guns so any attempt to make your gaming experience more realistic is quickly batted down because i like using the guns but then i must fly back across to friendly territory to restock my ammo costing quite a bit of valuable mission time
it seems unfortunate but thats the way the ace combat titles have always been
i hope namco fixes this minor problem when they release ac
im already drooling for itthis game is really good it has a resonable selection of airplanes and weapons
although the caroon movies are very corny you can skip them and get straight into the action
the system of the better you do the more money you get is great
with this system what type of plane you get is souly up to you
this is the best console flight simulater i have ever playedlook no further here is the game that will satisfy your dreams of jetjockey adventures at mach speedwhile ac doesnt offer the level of depth or complexity of a pc grade flight sim it does throw out gobs of fun and more adrenaline packing moments then you can shake your flight stick at
the simple and slick controls intuitive interface and helpful tutorial will allow most beginner players to the aircombat genre to immediately grasp acs core fundamentals navigation radar thrust weapons
although the game is a bit on the short side  missions it is extremely well designed with elegant level progression interesting mission variety and most surprising a nifty storyline presented in comicbookanime stills with eloquent voiceover
impressive atmospherics and keen attention to small details contribute significantly in enveloping the player in the world of ac  well produced radio chatter from wingmen awac info enemies and ground forces youre supporting truly raise the level of already excellent production design
graphically the game will not disappoint with photo realistic terrain beautiful plane models and impressive light sourcing and weather effects rain snowall in all a fun exciting game with a captivating storyline that left me jonesing for at least a few more missionsi love air combat games pure and simple
shooting down bombers dropping payloads on ground targets and dogfighting with jets  these are the core ingredients to a good flight action game and ace combat  has plenty of each
its not perfect but there is a lot to enjoyfirst the good stuff theres a nice selection of fighter jets to fly in this game and you acquire them rapidly enough to keep it interesting
you can also acquire more advanced weapons as the game progresses  some of which are just plain fun to blow stuff up with
missions take place over beautiful scenery and amongst nicely rendered clouds
top that off with optional full d cockpit views and you can really get immersed in acother pluses include an extremely tight though semiarcade style control setup spot on sound and music cinematic replays that cannot be saved sadly and a very intuitive menu system
ac also has a solid story tied in by occasional comicbookart cut scenesnow for the bad of which there is not much
first off the campaign is only  missions
theyre fun to play but even on normal difficulty the second hardest setting the whole thing is over with way too quickly
this brings me to my other complaint which i consider to be much more serious  theres no single player game outside of the campaign
this game is just begging for a random dogfightbombingdefenseetc mission generator
if ac had that or a much longer campaign with multiple possible branches in the story i would have given it  stars overall for the huge boost in replay valueheres the bottom line even  years after its release ace combat  looks really good and is an extremely solid air combat sim
its definitely among the top games ive ever owned for any console but especially the ps
great controls a fun campaign large selection of expensive military toys to play with add it all up and you get a musthave addition to any ps gamers collectionthe fact that they have these lame japanesetype comic book style cut scenes and awful voice over is why i didnt score this game a  out of i dont like the missions as being made up
you can tell this game was made in japan because the missions were kinda out there almost metal gear solidtype stuff
really unbelievable
they shouldve made the games more like the navy seals socom series where you had threats that were real and in real locations
its seemed too futuristic for me
what saved this game is the control the combat the missions the weapons the fact that you can buy additional air craft and you can actually replay the game from the beginning keeping what youve bought and earned so far
the cut scenes have this stupidly out of place narration that thankfully can be skipped
however the fact that they poisoned the game with that junk really is a shamebut i enjoy the game a lot
this is my second time playing it this time im going to try to earn a a rating on each mission
one time i even earned an s rating
after i finish this game its on to socom iii navy sealsif you want the best wrestling gameor  of the best game everget smackdown here comes the painthis is good nowadays and it beats the other wrestling games on the gamecube and xboxi was gonna stop at smackdown
 but i thought id go ahead and get the rest of the series just so i could have it
the first one on my list was this one
now the first few time i played it i was like yeah this is okay
but i as i went on i started getting bored
eventually i just started playing smackdown
 again
now the game is okay but its not greatagain the graphics are better then smackdown
 but worse then smackdown
 there are more then  superstars to choose from less then both of the previously mentioned
exhibition mode still has alot of matches to choose from
theres still single tag team six man tag handicap royal rumble king of the ring hardcore falls count anywhere survival and special
special matches include cage i quit table ladder tlc special referee hell in a cell ironman  stages of hell and slobber knocker
the controls arent very different from smackdown
 so you wont have to much trouble figuring it all out if youve played the second onestory mode isnt much better then smackdown
 and is really short
the only good thing is the unlockables and theres alot of those so its something to look forward to
other then that story mode is pretty boringcreate mode is pretty much the same except for create a payperview not being in
create a superstar is quite a big improvement from smackdown
 where you have even more control
there are more types of moves to be assigned this time and you also have the power to change the default superstars move set
create a taunt is still very pointless and create a stable is the same as smackdown
 except you cant assign as many people to one stabletheatre mode is actually quite a bit better then smackdown
 you get to watch a behind the scences of how the commercials for smackdown
 and  were made
theyre pretty funny toall in all smackdown
 is one of the worst of the series
if you have a ps id recommend buying smackdown
 instead
but if you want to own all of them this is still a good gamethis game is good but needs some improvementthe royal rumble still has four people in the ring at the same timeyou can do the same thing a million times in the story mode without it changing and it doesnt have is many superstars as there were at that time but it is still a good gamei traded my friend a wrestling game i didnt like for this and i love it
its fastl fun and has catchy background music
if u play a hardcore match u can go anywhere an i mean anywhere
a kool thing about this one is if u do ur finisher and it works u can pin them immediately and win
some downsides are the graphics well remember this is  the memory card space and the way the caw faces look retarded
overall its fun but i wouldnt recommend it to people who care to much for graphicsi just want to say that this game has its ups and its downs
that is why i gave it a  the story mode is terrible the action is too fastpaced and the controls are hard to use
the entrances movies and gameplay are just like the real thing though
really the only thing that has a reply value is the createawrestler mode
that has an infinte replay value
heck thats enough to warrant a purchase by itself  theres really no excuse to not buy it
i love the selection of match modes and wrestlers
this is a musthave for the wrestling fan
if you want you can rent it first to see how you like it then buy it but play it anywayseeing its been awhile since shut your mouth came out i will go ahead and give my view on this game
its a ok game but lacks the following
good season mode
few matches then its over
needed better arenas
the newer wrestlers at that time when it came out should have been on there seeing they delayed it for a good whileon the other hand it has its good sides
better graphics than sd  amp 
cool entrances not just a full screen then  seconds of your wrestler coming out
cool matchesand thats about itpeacethis game is much better than smackdown know your role on regular playstation
the graphics are smoother and clearer the animation is better the gameplay is faster and even better theres hardly any loading
however this game does have its cons
the commentary gets annoying after a while but atleast it can be turned off in the options
the story mode is limited
that stinks
plus a lot of the matches and wrestlers are similar to the ones on smackdown kyr on ps
the moves and gameplay hasnt changed much
however the entrances and superstar themes are very realistic
thats a good thing
the undertaker comes out on his motorcycle to his correct entrance theme rollin which is very cool
you can create your own superstar and taunts and everything
thats pretty cool too
you can fight through the crowd a little bit but not much
that stinks
plus theres no freakin blood
you get to use weapons in this game including a x wrapped in barbed wire and when you hit your opponent with it they dont bleed or anything
that really stinks
also a lot of wrestlers arent included in this game
wheres tommy dreamer
wheres rvd
wheres brock lesnar
why the lack of superstars
of course if you play through the story mode you can access more wrestlers and stuff but nothing too significant
this is not a bad game at all smackdown  know your role was probably one of the best wrestling games ive ever played
i love its fun arcade style actionnow enter smackdown  just brink it after viewing screenshots movies etc
i see that the games graphics have improved slightly over its predecessors which isnt really saying much considering that its on a nextgen console
this is not a big gripe for me considering that i believe that the graphics are still top notchsmackdown just bring it will also have new modes of gameplay the one that im most excited about is the abiltiy to play with up to  players in the ring at once
the addition of a referee is a nice touch one that many videogame fans have been asking for
they also added commentary which is great news to me as i always love a little commentary on the side i just hope that the commentary doesnt get repetitive quicklythe gameplay is relativly the same well exactly the same
not a big deal to me as i love the arcade feel of the game which makes it fun to play with friends
if you got bored of the gameplay after smackdown and smackdown  i dont recommend this because the gameplay is the sameafter being bored to tears with wwe  and wwe  i always like to rewind time and play thqs better offerings
heres my reviewgraphicsthe one thing i wasnt too crazy about in this game was the graphics
theyre not bad by any means in fact the wrestlers move fast and fluid with lots of animation
however during the entrances is the ugliest part of the game
i realize this game came out in  but wow the entrances didnt show a next gen leap at all
square heads flat faces boxy hands and such rear its ugly headthats about as bad as the game looks cutscenes and entrances however once you get into the ring the game is beautiful
the animation is really good
i particularly was fond of when you pulled off a reversal only to suplex or clothesline an opponent whod sell a move really good
all of the moves have impact which is missing from the new wwe games
a suplex looks like it really hurts clotheslines or bodyslams look equally painful
basically any move in the game looks fantastic and the wrestlers actually look good in the ring with no slowdownsoundtheres something i actually like about the annoying commentary found in this game
michael cole and tazzs commentary are really brutal
i wonder why being that past games ike wwf warzone or wwf attitude actually had stellar commentarythe commentary sounds like every phrase is telegraphed in the sense of perrysaturnis insert
it doesnt sound natural at allthe music is appropriate and i liked some of the theme songs like dean malenkos james bond inspired songthe slams and such sound nice
theres no grunts that i hear and the weapons had dull thudsgameplayfirst off the one thing i hate about the control is that it doesnt support analog control
to some this is minor but i feel a wrestling game should always support analog controlanyway the control is about the same as the previous smackdown being that square is reverse triangle is run x is to punch or kick and o is to grapple
the other buttons arent really needed until you find yourself in a match featuring more than  wrestlersi really like how smooth the control scheme is in this game and wish they still used this for modern games
the control is super responsivethe games roster is the only gripe i had
it features perry saturn eddie guerrero dean malenko test albert dudley boys edge kurt angle chris jericho chris benoit triple h undertaker kane big show raven the rock stone cold steve austin rikishi and suchim surprised this game didnt feature a better roster being that there were a good amount of wrestlers around then and this was around the invasion angles beginning
sdsym has a better rosterthe caw mode really stinks to be honest
i couldnt even pick a wrestlers theme song and the options are limitedi really dont have much to say bad about the game but it is a good game featuring a decent roster of wrestlers and some cool perks
some things worth noting would be that it has an excellent tlc match you can fight in the crowdbut i felt the wrestlers got up too fast
even after hitting them with a finisher theyd get back upthese smackdown games always make me lmao
get some friends to play with you and you have almost unlimited laughs
reccomended for the non hardcore wrestling fana lot of hype for a game that does not bring a huge amount to the table
dont get me wrong the graphics are great and the wrestling action in nearly unmatched
that said the commentary is horrid the carrerstory mode is pathetic and the wrestler intros are accurate but unimaginative
why add these features if you are not going to make them add value to the gamewrestling fans your cries have been heard
the wrestlinggame gods over at yukes and thq have brought you a wrestling game with more tables ladders and motorcycle ring entrances than ever before
unfortunately they had to leave some important stuff out
just bring it is by far the most ambitious and complete wrestling game in history
over  wrestlers can compete in well over  match types ranging from hardcore to coffin matches to king of the ring
if the rosters not large enough for you you can create your own wrestler with the genres most complete create a superstar mode
the playstation  really does the game justice
the wrestlers grapple and brawl with smooth realism but the action sometimes seems stiff
still smackdowns tvstyle presentation will knock hardcore fans on their buttswith all its strengths the games faults are tempting to ignore
smackdowns ringside commentary calls out moves that neither the player nor the superstar even thought of performing and the music fails too generic rocktype sonic patterns back the action and the smackdown theme is the only other song nearbyunless you count rolling by limp bizkit
move timing seems a little off as well making the simple moves frustrating to pull off
wwf smackdown just bring it packs in a ton of things that wrestling fans have been screaming about since wwf war zone but its weakness lies in the attention to the game not to the details
wrestling maniacs will drool ferociously for this title but nonfans still have no reason to bring itwith the ps getting all the attention these days t hawk  on the psone will probably get overlooked maybe even written off due to the fact that the og
playstation is an older system
big mistakehawk  still packs quite a punch on the original sony system
new levels new tricks fast action etc
all those qualities are heremy only beef is the createaskater option is basically the same as hawk   other than that this game rocks especially the airport level
the music is pretty good toothe third installment of tony hawks pro skater might have better looks in some areas but really its just a copy of tony hawk  i have figured out for almost every pro on this game there is a con so i have created a list of pros and cons for you to tell you what i really think of this gamepros you can choose to skate as tony or  other pro skaterscons you cant play as bob burnquistpros new and more challenging career mode with  massive levels such as canada and tokyo to explorecons some of the goals are so ridiculousy hard to get you are sure to get frustrated after a whilepros create a skater mode is still optionalcons no new hairstyles or anything is available
plus still no option to create female skaterspros skate park editor is back and you can choose new styles for your parkscons no new objects or sizes of parks plus no new premade parkspros twoplayer games still availablecons no new twoplayer gamesi have read about a lot of people disliking this memory card but my husband loves it
it holds twice as much as the ps cards do and its cheaper
whats not to like
aside from having to load the card everytime you put a new game in the machine or turn it on its not that bothersome
its very easy to use and it works greatwell i hope this can be useful to someone but i just recently purchased a ps and with the lack of memory cards on the market i became easily frustrated just trying to find one regardless of the company
all the stores pointed me to the internet so i looked and i saw all the negative reviews on the interact  mb card and i imidiately grew wary about purchasing it
but after countless hours searching online and in stores for a memory card i broke down and figured i would at least try the product and hope for the best since i couldnt save my games anyway
well i brought it home and being apprehensive i tried it out and it works fine
all my games are saved and i have not had a problem
everyone keeps saying that it doesnt work
well it states very clearly in the directions that you must load the software prior to loading a game
this is quite simple
insert the disk and let it start up
once the menu has loaded about  seconds to a minute take the disk back out and put in your game
then press start and follow the directions
once that is done it works just like every other memory card and the compression function is a plus as well
also for those saying the card does not work on their system it states very clearly that the card only works on us systems
so if you follow the directions you should not have a problem unless you have a nonus system
the only reason i gave this product  stars instead of  is because it can get rather monotonous having to load the disk everytime you start the system up but since sony has been slacking on their production i will deal and it is sonys loss of business
well i hope this was useful for you and if you really need a memory card and have a us system just read the simple directions and this card will work finethis is not a childish game
people 
this is another great racing game 
nothing much to say  buy itthis was quite a step from the original wrestlemania game for snes
this offered far better graphics music sound effects finishers and maneuvers
a nice broad pallet of superstars bret hart ric flair razor ramon hbk mr perfect and more each has their own unique finishing maneuver however they all have the same moves
this was also the first game to incorporate the wwfs  man over the top rope royal rumble but they did not include many more modes
a nice game but it is not as good as wwf raw for the snesi loved this game when it was the best a wrestling game could be in its day
it was released sometime in the early s on the snes
originaly it was to have hulk hogan in it but he left the wwf to join wcw and was taken out of the game before its releaseit was like its predoecsser wf wresltemaniasnes in the graphics department but the last game had little options and button mashing game play
this game however worked pretty much the same way but you had a special move
all the specials where preformed by using the shoulder r button but it depended on where you where situated
like the undertaker had to do it in a grapple to do the tombstone piledriver and guys like bret hart and ric flair had to do them on the ground at the feet
the hardest is lex lugers you have to whip him into the rope and run into the rope yourself and hit that r button when there close enough to elbow them in the facethe game was a lot of fun there was one on one tag and royal rumble
every charactor pretty much was the same with a different look but it was great fun the next version raw changed the moves around a bit and added some new moves but it wasnt as fun as this version
this is the best wrestling game on the snes
next to wrestlmania arcadewow what a gamea lot of wrestlers like ric flaircrushmacho man randy savage and orthersyou get royal rumbles and one on one challengersps buy it and have funthis game is classic buttonmashing at its best
darn fun and amusing as heck
it will make you laugh out loud
definitely worth a rental although theres not much to it
just punch and kick your opponent until he gets tired and goes down
then do a special move just for kicks
also since the hip toss out of the ring is so brutal you might want to try that too
and knock the referee down whenever you get the chance
lots of fun for the whole familythis game was quite good
the voice acting like the previous one was great and the story was good also perhaps better than the first games
the graphics were well not necessarily better just different
the enemies were rather good but not quite as good as the ones in part  plus this game was quite a bit more difficult than the first one with more difficult levels to complete and more complicated puzzles
there are only a couple of things about this game that im still a bit unsure and confused about  what ever happened to the beetle
he was never captured along with hammerhead the shocker or electro
he just gave the bionexus device to the sandman who later gave it to electro and then he brought hammerhead and his gangsters to electros hideout
after that he didnt appear anymore
hmmmm i wonder will he appear in the next game as the main bad guy
  did the sandman die after spiderman washed him down a storm drain or is he just waiting for another moment to strike at spiderman
oh well i guess those questions will be answered in the next gameif youre a big fan of spiderman youll probably like this game
either buy it or rent it
but just you wait till you see the game based on the movieits a good sequel to the first game
like the first game the controls are easy to master especially if you have played the first game
there are a couple puzzles to solve which can be challenging but its still a fun game to play over and oversome of the crimanals can be a little corny so you serious types may groan a bitthis is a great game i wish i could find the rare aug  version over the rereleased oct  they pulled the aug version do to the last level deal with the twin towers
the oct version has you fight on a bridge for the last levl
if any one every finds the aug version its rare so i would hold on to it
it might be worth money
the game is great but i only gave it a  because till i play the aug  version i can not say for sure witch i like better i like to play it the way it was intended to be played with the real last levelspideys back and this time hes going  stop electrothis game is the continue of the latest psone game spidermanthis game dos not cover ever thing that was annoying but that dosent mean that its like the old onethe game play is really simple and shortprosnew boss  electrohammerheadsandmanthe lizard and shockerthe gameplay is simple with a different story new web attacks new fighting moves new costumes consthe graphics are the same as the last gamethe cameras are low and is hard  look aroundthe game is  shortyou cant read the comics you collectthat all you need but dont buy the game even when its really easyrent the game but dont buy it its not worth youre moneythe first sm game for ps took everyone by surprise
who would have guessed that some game company would create a video game based on a comic book character could be this good
sadly the sequel just doesnt live up to the original
first of all youll notice that the game is made by vicarious visions not neversoft who made all of  the thps games for those of you who dont know and shame on you for not knowing
that may or may not seem like a big deal at first but once the game starts you can really tell it just doesnt put you over and put together well like the first one
the control doesnt feel as tight as it used to and the missions arent nearly as fun as before
the worst part is that it seems like all the good sm villans were used up and they hired backups for this one
theres no bad guys on par with venom and doc ock instead spidey must now battle secondgrade criminals like sandman and hammerhead who
this game could have been one of the last great ps games
as it stands its just a wasted opportunity
heres hoping  spiderman the movie game is betterthis is truly a great game and will be awesome for those who have boughten tony for gba the reason are because the levels are much more expansive and if your like me you memorized the tony levels pretty easily
the game however has a much different setup from any of the other ones such as you cant buy decks but unlock them in levels then find them in level
you can buy stats  we found out that was way to easy in tony but rather you find them in the levels
the hidden tapes are much harder to get to as well as doing certain moves on over or  in certain things
guess what its a game where one thing effects another
for example once you find the four earthquake challenges an earthquake errepts and thats the only way to get the hidden tape
let me tell you about the other aspect of the game
the camera angle is the same os tony for gba as well as the controls
you can make your  own player
 every stat he has starts out at at the same level which i like there are people and cars in this game such as find the five pickpockets one of your quests if you will
choppy graphics for people but very fluent for eveything else
the reason i gave it four stars is the player graphic i mean come on you see him all the time right
good game buy it pleasethis game is off the chain
the graphics are some of the best i have seen on gba the sound is tight and there are tons of tricks to bustthe controls take a little time to get wired but once you do its all good beefs thoughsome of the levels are too cluttered and you find yourself bouncing off rails ledges staircases etc like a pinball
also you cant choose your specialsover the past three years activisions tony hawk franchise has consistently proven to be one of the best action sports series on every platform it has appeared on which currently tallies up to eight and each sequel has been different enough and fun enough to keep bringing players back for more
tony hawks pro skater  is no exception and is probably the only game boy advance game to truly usurp tony hawk  tony hawks pro skater  plays just how youd expect tony hawks pro skater  to play albeit from an isometric perspective
in the singleplayer mode youll skate around different locations completing various objectives to progress to the next level
youre given a choice of  reallife pro skaters and there is also a createaskater option which lets you alter the skin tone shirt pants shoes and tattoos of your skater
the objectives youll have to complete include three different score objectives as well as collect letters to spell the word quotskatequot find a hidden tape and meet a slew of levelspecific goals that range from delivering airline tickets to a family in the airport level to grinding specific rails in the la level which triggers an earthquake and changes the terrain of the level
theres actually a fair amount of level interaction like this in tony hawk  though it isnt quite as deep as that found in the console versions of tony hawk  what it does offer makes the gameplay experience a bit more enjoyable
out of the six levels in the game two of them are competition levels in which the objective is to score as many points as you can with as few bails as possible in the allotted time limit
the gameplay is essentially identical to that of tony hawk  for the gba though there have been a few noteworthy changes
the default control configuration assigns nollies and flip tricks to the left shoulder button grinds to the a button jumps to the b button and grab tricks and the revert to the right shoulder button but it can be customized to your liking
yes tony hawk  features the revert a handy maneuver used to integrate vert tricks into the middle of combos
unlike tony hawk  for the gba tony hawk  has four different multiplayer modes
horse the game in which each player attempts to match the previous players trick can be played with up to four players using a single gba
the three link cable modes are trick attack tag and king of the hill
trick attack is a simple scorebased competition while tag and king of the hill are essentially reversed versions of the same game in which players either try to stay away from the skater whos quotitquot or take the crown away from the skater whos the quotkingquot multiplayer games have always been a staple of the tony hawk franchise and the modes included here are just as fun and playable as in any other incarnations of tony hawktony hawk  still stands as one of the sharpestlooking games for the gba and tony hawk  improves upon it
the game is viewed from an isometric perspective giving you a wide overview of the level around you
the skaters are d polygonal models that are expertly animated and represent their console counterparts beautifully
and while the skater models in tony hawk  were textured with flat colors in tony hawk  they have simple but effective textures that bring them just a bit closer to replicating the real thing
the levels also look great though the isometric perspective can still sometimes be cumbersome
vicarious visions has smoothed out the formula a bit since tony hawk  so the view doesnt create quite as many frustrating moments
vicarious visions has also done a great job of recreating the sounds of tony hawk on the game boy advance
all the skate sounds from your trucks grinding a rail to the roll of your wheels over concrete have been sampled directly from the console versions and all the effects sound sharp
the game features a soundtrack of digital renditions of numerous songs from the tony hawk  soundtrack though the selections are almost entirely guitarbased songs making the soundtrack slightly less appealing if you dont like rock
the tracks are surprisingly true to the source material but some get a bit muddled in the translation
with the great impression that tony hawk  for the gba made on many gamers vicarious visions could have easily just thrown the tony hawk  levels into the same exact game and still have a quality title
instead it went the extra mile and included an improved trick system improved graphics multiplayer support and a createaskater mode creating an exceptional game and maintaining the tony hawk tradition of perpetually creating better games
tony hawks pro skater  used to be the mustown action sports game for the game boy advance
meet the new titleholderthis game is way fun
its different than a lot of other strategy games because you can train each unit into something else or just augment it with special powers which is especially revolutionary
i would recomend this game to anyone who likes pc strategy games just because of the new way of playing a strategy game that you encounter
instead of turning the units out cookie cutter style it makes you realize that they are little pseudopeople who require different types of trainingmay favorite units were the werewolves and the master warlocks
i subtracted a star because i thought if couldve been cooler if each unit had an experience level and it could advance into something stronger like for werewolves it couldve been silverback werewolf then bloodfang werewolf or something you knowanyways the game pretty much rocksbattle realms is simply put a classic
its a great game its just sad that it didnt get more recognition having been overshadowed by warcraft  battle realms has four playable factions clans dragon serpent wolf and lotus
even with their similarities liquid managed to make them feel differentthe best thing about battle realms is that the world is a resource
water and rice are required to feed your clan but there is more to it than simple gathering
crops need to be watered regularly in order for them to grow
horses can be collected to be used as pack animals mounts or in the wolf clans case food for wolf pups
terrain also plays a very important role units that are on higher ground will do more damage and see farther
unit production is unique to battle realms in the sense that units arent just made at specific buildings
peasants are sent in and a certain unit comes out
there are a few different combinations that all eventually lead back to one unitin the single player campaign the player takes the role of kenji a serpent clan aristocrat who fled after he was accused of murdering his father
kenji can choose to either revive the ancient traditions of the dragon clan or continue the wicked ways of the serpent clan
you are given the option of which province you want to attack via a map depending on the map you choose youll come across different heroes who will later join you
skirmish mode lets you fight seven ai opponents the great thing about the ai is that you can specifically order them where to attack or send troops
unfortunately the liquid dumbed the ai down with later patches thanks in no small part to a whiners choir of reviewers who didnt know how to play
battle realms use of sounds is excellent and its soundtrack is topnotch
beyond that there isnt much to say about it as far as sounds gobattle realms is not without its flaws however
for one thing the fire effects can cause a lot of lag on older computers even if said computer more than meets the suggested system requirements
there are times when units wont pay attention to their stances ie theyll move even if you tell them to hold position and sometimes theyll ignore your orders and attack instead of move
controlling units in the middle of a battle can also be very difficulteven with its flaws battle realms is a unique game that should have been a success
sadly it didnt get nearly as much of a following as it should haveif you like monsters scaring people or anything monsters inc then you will love this original game
the graphics arent very good but you have to consider that it is a very old game
probably from  as long as you can look past that this game is very interesting and fun
you get to explore and do a lot of crazy things
jumping collecting and scaring just to name a few
i recommend this game fro kids ages  because it can get tricky at a few momentsim not a big fan of platform games but this one is quite enjoyablethe controls are easy to learn the objectives are clear and the puzzles are just hard enough to keep you trying until you succeed but not so hard you fling your game controller across the room in frustrationfilled with characters from the movie though the voices sound like imitations for the most part and interspersed with actual film clips in low resolution this does a good job of feeling like the sort of training mike and sulley would have had to go through to become scarersafter all there could be anything on the other side of that doorgame control is spelled out clearly in a mandatory tutorial section every new game starts with the tutorial but you earn a couple extra lives for the effort and the game responds well to commands
its surprisingly replayable especially if you have a yearold at your elbow imitating mike and sulley but the levels dont really feel like they were designed with the goldsilverbronze schema in mind theres an allornothing aspect to each level that seems to be geared on how many of the powerups youve earned
in other words you fight like mad to win the bronze medal on a level then earn the powerup and go back and breeze your way to a silver and a gold almost effortlesslythe sound work is good but the graphics could have used some helpive been playing this on a ps and flipping back and forth between this game and jak and daxter sharply illustrates the limitations of psx games
the d movement capabilities of this game are almost ps quality its very rare that a camera anglewhich you can controlmakes you miss a move or lose a life but the figures and backgrounds render very harshlya fun game even if your yearold wants to watch you play it for hours and hours
its also the only way youre going to get to see any of this movie on your home system before september
one caveat  if you havent seen the movie you might want to before you play this game
the orso minutes of movie clips your rewards for completing tasks include several from the final act of the movie
yes important clips that give away big plot resolutions
you have been warnedwow i gotta say this game is pretty good
the graphics are nicely done the loads are quick and the mini movies clips are neat
i never saw the movie but when i bought this game i found out a whole lot about it
first of all when i started playing this game i thought oh man this game is boring
well i thought wrong
the game begins with mike or sulley in the training area
yes you do get to choose or switch off between the two characters
later you go to different levels of an area to scare these robot dudes
 of the time you are successful unless you decide not to press any buttons
but why wouldnt you
anyways there arent any boss levels in case youre wondering
the game is easy i beat it  times and you can save up to  files for  memory block
overall the game is neat easy and um i guess quite affordableits  fun    but  not  as  fun    or  addictive  as  heroes  iii  complete  
i  wish  do  was  still  making  more  instead  of  ubisoft  ive been hooked on homm since the very first one go back and play that and youll realize how far the series has come
homm  had a totally different feel from the third installment
some of these new aspects are good while others make you wish theyd kept things the same as before
having your heroes fight in combat is really cool and even if they die you can get them back in various ways
also the new skills and class system adds a ton of depth to the game as you now get to chose what your hero becomes
most of the new creatures are pretty cool although since when is the ballista considered a creature
the game does seem to play a little slower than homm although you can vary the speed at which you and opposing heroes move both on the world map and in combat
i also love the addition of a caravan
no more having to have one hero be the transporter of troops back and forth
also the creatures in the towns grow at a more realistic rate meaning new ones appear each day
growth is still based on weekly totals though so if you buy all the creatures for that week no more will appear till the next weeklots of good stuff but there are some bad aspects
the graphics while d and more realistic seem to have lost something
i cant exactly say what but i prefered the more fantasy looking creatures of homm   the new magic and class system can be confusing at first even to veterans of homm
castle seiges have also been taken down a notch in homm
there are no arrow towers catapults etc in seige battles
there are still walls the drawbridge and a moat and the defenders ranged troops occupy perches inside the castle to give them an advantage but to me seige battles have lost something in this edition
also during combat it can sometimes be hard to tell who youre attacking
i know ive meant to attack one creature stack and ended up just flying next to them or hitting a completely different set of enemies
there is no multiplayer yet it says it will be added for free however but this really doesnt effect me since i prefer to play alone or just have hotseat games w my friends
all in all homm is a welcome albeit somewhat flawed edition to the heroes series
a must buy for heroes fans craving new adventuresheros of might and magic is probably one of the most hyped and delayed games in the past couple years
the wait is finally over
after playing with it for the past few days i found a lot of nice improvements and new features but still wont consider it a revolutionary sequal to homm the graphics is surely nicer and have a good d look although it is still just d perfect for slower computers the heros are more useful these days you can actually using them in battle
but be very careful since they are easy to get killed in battle especially in early levels the map grow much larger even the first level will take a while to finish most creatures are the same following the same level system
one interesting fact is that level  creatures are usually very effective on on level  creaters  now creatures growth are calculated daily or longerdepending on the creature level quick combat will automatically calculate the battle results when you face far inferier opponents creatures may not walk to you and attack so be careful when walking around the mapoverall the game become harder
you really need to think about strategy when building up the army and exploring the mapthe heroes of might and magic series are very addictive games
they draw you in and hours fly by like seconds
your prescious time gets wasted extremely fast
even though the game is very enjoyable the way you get addicted to it makes it lose one starfrom the mightiest pharaoh to the lowliest peasantwho doesnt enjoy a good light gun gametop three reasons why this one is better than mosttime crisis  rewards you for playingearn continuescreditsnew games and moremany arcade to home light gun titiles dont give you squatmini games that look like theyve come from the way cool point blank seriesof course the two player cooperative playforget about doing this game with the cpugrab a friend and play this disc the way its meant to be playedseeing your partner on the screen working with you adds mucho fun to this style of gamei didnt know there was a gun controller for the ps until i started searching around and found the guncon packaged with this game
i couldnt imagine playing this without the gun controller so you really should find the bundled package
unfortunately the unique controller is the only thing interesting about the game
it is fun but by the time i was just getting into the game it was over
there are only three levels and some uninteresting standalone extra games
hopefully the sequel will contain more gameplaythe guncon design leaves a bit to be desired
i hold the gun with two hands and found my left hand constantly bumping the pause button during gameplay
also the a and b buttons are up out of the way not convenient for a standard shooting hold
the actual control of the gun works great though and i hope to find more games that utilize the controllerit is very unfortunate that there are so few shooters out there on the modern video game platforms
things have progressed a lot from the days of duck hunt but i am pleased with the resultstime crisis  is a great game
it is a lot like being in an interactive cop movie and you get to shoot the bad guys
the graphics are pretty good although not the top ps graphics by any means
the ai is weak but it doesnt matter because you dont have time to try and outthink the enemies
its a great game to just pop in the console and play for a while if you dont want to have to thinkthe guncon  itself is sort of bleah to me
as someone who likes using guns in real life i prefer something a little heavier than the guncon  gives me
i end up overcompensating for the weight because i am used to real guns
so the guncon looks a lot like that rope gun batman used in the michael keaton version of the batman movie i dont care because it is functional
i may end up buying another light gun soon so i can play the game with a gun in each handill shut up now and just tell you to go get the game
unless you are expecting a deep thoughtful final fantasy type experience you will not be dissapointedfirst you can use the old guncon but you might as well get the time crisisguncon package for just a little more the guncon seems much more accurate its got a direction pad on the heel where the hammer would be on a gun and an a and b button on either side of the gun
the start and pause buttons are both located on the left sorry lefties
note that the time crisisguncon only comes with a standard hook up with video and left and right audio rca plugs
if you are using svideo or component video you will need to get an adaptor and turn up the brightnesscontrast on your tv to get the best response to your shotsthe game itself is really fast paced and you learn to use that duck button pretty quick to get out of the way of missiles
stages just from the first act have you in a motorboat with enemies motoring literially all around you and you have to avoid hitting your partner
you really get a sense of d movement as the game rotates your viewpoint from time to time
graphics look great and enemies react according to where they get shot fall back if shot in the head fall forward or to the side if shot on the leg well animated and a nice touchas noted by another viewer you get rewarded for playing the minimum being extra tokens to continue your game
the little extra games are great for target practicing and unlocking secret areasgamesif youve played the original time crisis youll love this game for being better in everyway well the storyline is still trite
this is a very well made shooter and loads of fun with a second gun with a friend or you can even try it john woostyle but its hard to duck
blast awayoverall i think agent under fire has great graphics and is wellthought outhowever there are a few things you may find annoying the controls are different for different levels so there is a slight learning curve
the levels tend to be fairly short
as youll see you get a bonus for how quickly you complete a level which is based on a quotsuggestedquot time to complete
to me it should take more than  minutes to complete a level for this type of game
maybe this is just mebut at a few instances i was unsure of what i needed to do
for example while driving a tank i wasnt sure how to switch weapons
during a fight with a major character i didnt know you could steer missles after theyd been firedoverallvery cool game with some baggagethe game itself is only moderately entertaining and that is even being a tad generous considering its age but the true value of this game lies in its use as a way to hack a playstationfirst off i have to say i did not buy this game i rented it first and i love it
i always loved the original goldeneye and perfect dark and this is just as good but that is also why i didnt give it  stars
the graphics are only marginally better than the ns version and so i am beginning to wonder why would i pay  bucks on a system that offers little more for a game like this
but with the graphics aside the game is still great and a lot of fun
i will buy it just so i have the multiplayer since i dont have any of the othersno matter what  goldeneye for n developed by rareware will be the best first person shooter for this classic series
not only because of the high fun factor but also because of the high replay value it has
you can play it again and again not to mention the multiplayer mode which is great
 agent under fire by ea games got close enough
levels have great graphics and details there are different modes including driving the bmw z in the streets multiplayer is fun after you get the hang out of it
to synthesizehighs enemies have high iqs cool graphics nice weapon arsenal very detailed great multiplayer mode two words bond girlslows bodies disappear after you have shot them only  levels in the whole game bonds face is horribleverdictyoull definitely finish the game fast even in agent mode but if you like a good multiplayer game this is the closest youll get to goldeneye
fun factor golden eye  the world is not enough are  of the best bond video games out there
ea doesnt have a great reputation of putting out great james bond games but they were some good games
in this game you have to go after this man named nigel bloch  this woman named malprave who are holding world leaders hostage
you team up with c  i  a agent zoey nightshade
now this game isnt based on any of the movies i dont know if it is based off any of the novels
you get  driving levels  the car has weapons
the weapon selection is good of course you get the classic walther ppk along with assassault weapons
controls are fine the enemy movement is sporadic  it is a problem i wish they couldve fixed that
the gadgets are there  are fun to use
so this is a great game its not up to par with golden eye so if you decide to play it expect some minor flaws
next ill take a look at nightfirei got this at media play today and was very excited to get it
my happiness died a little after playing it
its funsometimes it has impresive graphicsusually and the enemy ai is realisticevery once in awhile
everyone makes a big deal about the games  missions an hour into it im on mission  and with very good ratings in my finished missions
the problem really is simply the length of the missions and their simplicity are far too lowi have not played the multiplayer yet but it could be fun it supports the multitap
interesting mix of st person shooter driving sim covert missions and a kind of virtua cop missions in single player
but the game is soooo short and soooo easy
beware its good but it wont last long and what st person shooter ever has much replay value
this one wont have much either
just be carefulagent under fire is the latest james bond video game and although it is not as good as goldeneye the game is still fun filled and exciting to play
although it is very short only twelve missions in all agent under fire is able to set up a decent storyline without the help of a movie this time around and is also able to work in all the necessary weapons for bond to use for his battle against evil
whats really exciting about this game though is the mutliplayer
once again going head to head with your buddies in the eviornments and all the weapons is lots of fun and exceeds the regular gameplay
overall agent under fire is well worth your time and will provide good game play for many hours amongst friendsthis is a pretty solid shootemup from ea not known for their prowess in this type of game
basically if you love bond youll be into this game
its not your traditional modern fps
why
well since bond movies are traditionally pg or pg the game stays in that mode
thats one of the few major complaints really
the movement the shooting and the action are all great but theres not a drop of blood here
strictly bond shootemup style
dont expect red faction or half lifetype carnage
nevertheless this game has a very impressive gun selection as well as an extra feature in your other hand the various q devices
these make the game fun and challenging
like the films the game features bonds amazing cel phone which has a laser a decoder an awesome grappling hook called the qclaw etcat first i thought this game was a bit easy but you can adjust the difficulty level and as you make your way through the  missions they certainly get harder but not frustratinga big big bonus is a great player mode
fans of perfect dark made by the same folks that made the incredible goldeneye will love it
there are  modes your basic deathmatch protect the flag and antiterrorist training
deathmatch is simplehunt the other guy down
in protect the flag one player has to hold on to a flag for a fixed amount of time say  minutes in total before the other player does
but the best has to be antiterrorist training
its deathmatch with a great twist there are bombs on the board which must be defused
get to them before your opponent
 point for a player kill  points for a bomb defusal meaning youre constantly moving and hunting
for all multiplayer modes you get to choose what guns appear on the board and there are plenty to choose from
you also determine what powerups appear and you can even play with things like gravity selfinflicted damage etc
its one of the most versatile player modes ive seen yet on psall in all this is a great game
especially if you love bond
all of the characters are here and even though the real actors and actresses dont play them theyre close enough
the bond in the cinema screens here looks enough like brosnan
its a lot of fun period
even if you dont like bond the options alone are worthwhile
the player missions have you running around as well as driving bonds bmw z an aston martin and even has you standing out of a sunroof shooting while someone else drivesmajor complaint again the lack of blood
its unfortunate but it honestly doesnt take away from solid game play control action graphics and sound
oh and on each board there are certain bond moves that you can pull
opening a door with a gadget blowing something up etc
when you do them the bond theme plays just like the movies
again a lot of funthe single player element is ok i guess but im still waiting for these types of games to become more openended
example they give you this great claw that can be used on exactly one tiny surface in an entire mission
what a tease
it is fun to replay some of the missions to beat your score
unfortunately the unlockable stuff isnt really worth unlocking
i dont mind a game that gives you all options up front but if youre gonna bother us with unlockables make em goodif you have some friends the p stuff is really quite good
turn on either the claw or jetpacks to take your fps vertical
the handicap system is quite nice for keeping things going with players of different skill levels
you can change the speed and gravity
if this had bots and morebetter levels it would be a star gameagent under fire is the first playable bond game since the groundbreaking goldeneye
although i like the n  controls much better and i really wish i could make cumstom controls for auf there are several controller settings but none of them are what i would like this game still manages to beat out the laughable games of quotthe world is not enoughquot and quottomarrow never diesquoti have yet to decide if this game is better than timesplitters
mainly because i have not yet had the chance to play multiplayer against anyone other than my  year old brother hes good but not that good
but the single player is deffinately better than timesplitters and although different ranks up there with red factions single playeri just bought this game today thinking it was going to be a sequel to the first
then when i put it in and started to play it was only a beefed up original version
dissapionted i still played it and had fun with it although it was easier than the first i beat it within the first two hours of playing
if you are thinking of buyin this game and you already have the fist ssx game dont get it if you are a fan of ssx and dont have the first ssx this one would be a better choiceits ssx tricky
there really isnt any need for me to say anything more so ill leave it at thatthis is a good game for racing but the tricks are a bit hard and the show off mode is hard to finishi know this game has been out for a while but i picked it up at the bargain price of  bucks
let me just say it is well worth it
the game is a lot of fun
i am not a skater but i always loved the tony hawk games and so i wanted to try out snowboarding
well shaun palmers game was pretty lousy but this game is so over the top it is a blast to play
picking up with friends is easy and fun
i also found that unlocking characters courses and boards is not too tough as you only have to earn a bronz on each level to do so
the controls are a little awkward at first but you can get the hang of it
i would have liked maybe a control modification option because circle and triangle do nothing in the game and i think they could have been better as trick buttons
either way it is not too hard
as for the level difficulty well that ranges depending on what character your using
i started the game with eddie and while i was mean on the race course i had an awful time finishing the showoff levels
but using mac on the showoff levels i got golds with ease
it is important to level up your guys stats appropriately because the game does get very hard
a few gripes i have about the game that make it extremely repetitive is that many of the stunts are extremely difficult to perform
for showoff modes in order to get gold medals you have to score huge amounts of points on very difficult tracks
the courses get harder and harder and there are less chances for big air so rail riding becomes integral to winning
but unlike tony hawk getting on rails is very hard and very annoying
in thps as long as you jumped relatively close to a rail you could grind but in ssx you have to be spot on even if you have a rider who is good at rails
being so precise is difficult because you are flying down a mountain at tremendous speeds and it ishard to gauge how far your jump is gonna be
so often you will jump over or be short of a rail
rails should have been easier since they are important to scoring in most levels
there are often stretches where there are no jumps at all so the only way to score points is to grind but they are set up that if you miss the first part of the rail you cannot get on it at any other point
this is confusing i know but it basically means that if you miss the rail that entire stunt is missed completely and you may have to ride on for about  seconds or so before another stunt comes up meanwhile your special meter is running out
hat leads to another problem with course layout
filling your tricky meter for uber tricks takes some doing but often you will fill it then find that there are no big stunts anywhere in sight to perform it
you need lots of air so you have to plan ahead
this gets annoying at times but thats life
for the most part i really like the game
it does get real hard real fast but if you are reallyinto it you can get through most of it
just be sure to use the right characters for the right events
a create a rider also would have been a nice feature that was left outssx tricky is largely just an updated version of ssx
the courses brought over from the original game are themselves greatly improved for tricks which are now even more important for winning races some courses such as pipedream are significantly different from before
the addition of uumlbertricks is extremely interesting with each character possessing unique uumlbertricks which often defy physics and logicthe main downfall of the game for me is that the new voices used for the characters brought over from ssx are significantly different from before in some cases such as with zoe and jp this drastically alters the characters personalities from the first game to the quotsequelquot  this is the main reason i give ssx tricky a  rating and not a but a very significant bonus to the game is the addition of dvd movie material
along with a pair of ea sports big promos the disc includes numerous quotmaking ofquot clips covering aspects from voice acting to the concept to the music to the tricks and beyond
in fact this is a good place to start especially for those who have not played the original ssx as this provides glimpses of most of the circuits and players and can help in understanding game strategy
also included with the dvd materials is a jukebox allowing players to listen to most of the music used in the gamessx tricky is certainly worth buying for the ps collection
however those who have played and loved the original ssx may feel a little let down at the differences in carriedover characters and may initially feel quite confused at the differences in some of the courseseveryone knows the good stuff about ssx tricky its definitely funbut there are a few things that could have been improved upon to make it a  game
first off some of the tracks get a bit gimmicky especially tokyo megaplexwhat the heck was that
i also think there is too much emphasis on riding railsthe freakin rails are everywhere and i get really tired of hitting the rail posts when all i want to do is snowboard
i mean is this a snowboarding game or a skateboarding game
not to mention the rails are really tough to stay on
lastly the games physics could have been better tootheres nothing more frustrating than when your character falls and then cant get up because he or she keeps banging into random crap
or when youre cruising along and then suddenly your dude bites it for no apparent reason
i guess in the end i just wish there were slightly more openrange freeriding tracks where you can cruise down the mountain to your hearts content without banging into a million stupid rails or fences or trees
i just bought ssx  hoping maybe theyd fixed some of these issues but so far im saddened to see its more gimmicky overthetop courses with tons of obstacles to get in your waywell here it is the long awaited sequel to the mother of all snowboarding games
and there it goes  
this game needs alot of work it seemed a little rushed
first and foremost two words play value
this game has little of it
there is not enough options or tracks
the dialogue gets to be very annoying very soon
once you max out your players stats you are left with  dollars worth of repetition
the addition of the signature and uber tricks are a refreshing change but not worth the money
my advice stick with the first ssx
thats it from me
im outvampire night seems like the ps owners consolation prize for not being able to play house of the dead  but dont worry its just as good as that masterpiecewell almostfirst of all the graphics are fantastic better than arcade contemporaries ninja assault and confidential mission which also have console conversions
the style is best showcased in the first chapter with some superb depictions  of winter sunlight on a frozen lake
luckily even players who stink at the game can get to see this
but the impressive visual style carries on all the way to the end which is refreshing as in some gun games the levels seem to get less interesting
maybe the designers feel that most players will never get any further than the first stage when playing in the arcade so they dont feel its worth the extra effort
the enemies and townsfolk are also realistic and well animated and the design of the vampires castle is fantastic full of grandiose chambers giant towers and lofty walkways all depicted in elaborate detailso what about gameplay
well its all pretty standard and if anything its an easier game than hotd so you could be facing the final showdown after not too many attempts
but the boss battles are better because they display an attack bar as well as a life bar for the boss so you can see how close you are to being lamped and can blast accordingly
some of the bosses especially the first come in more than one stage often morphing into a different shape during the fight
the first boss is a particulary impressive encounter with three entirely seperate phases to play through  a great idea
on the downside there are fewer alternate routes through the game which is a pity
of course the extra modes are usually what makes a lightgun game live or die in the console market and i quite enjoyed those on offer here
the training sesion is as seems to be the standard now horrendously difficult much harder than the game itself so plenty of challenge there
and the mission mode gives you a special objective to look out for each time you play through the story such as finding lost treaure or opening secret doors that do not appear in arcade mode so that can be fun too as there are around  different missions to complete
plusyou trade the special items forund in this mode at a shop and can buy power ups and attachments with money earned
theres even a gallery of artwork and character biographies to browse throughto sum up vampire night is a slick and polished lightgun game that lives up to its expectations and a good alterantive to house of the dead  so fans of the genre will be very happy with it
its just a shame that only dreamcast owners can enjoy the very best of the lotwell whadya know
i finally like a game and now suddenly everyone else hates it
sighthis is a really fun game
the boss fights are awesome
you have to avoid spells and other things while shooting them in unusual places like shooting their face
if that doesnt sound fun well this game is not for you
shooting the boss bat is a lot of fun because you have to keep shooting it
the way the bat swoops down and tries to seriously hurt you is a lot of fun avoidingbut dont avoid this game
just avoid the danger that one bat possessesvampire night for playstation  is a perfect translation of its arcade counterpart
for those who have not played it its a first person guided path shooting game very similar to the house of the dead
unfortunately vampire night also shares the house of the dead series bad dialogue and story
however one must remember that vampire night was an arcade game
that means it is meant to emphasize on quick flashy gameplay and amazing graphicsand it is in that area that vampire night excels
the simple gameplay allows anyone to jump into the game so its great if you dont want to spend alot of time mastering complex controls
although it will only take you about  to  minutes to plow through the game its still fun to play the  player mode over and over
in addition the special and training modes that were added to this home version help provide more replay value also
the dpad and the analog stick work surprisingly well with vampire night so theres no need to blow money on a light gun unless you insist on fully recreating the arcade experience
those who crave fast arcade shooting action will love vampire night
if you are looking for something deeper with an involving story i suggest you get red faction or metal gear solid  insteadi have a lot of respect for this game it is my favorite one but a few others come very closemy uncle gave this to me along with a few other obscure games and it was instantly addictive
my friend and i became obsessed with itcomparing everything to it even random objects not just other gamesthis is definitely worth the moneyit is quite unusual for a plot but one thing i love about this game is the way they do it
they start it off like a story book and continue with the story book feel after the beginning but not in an intrusive way
there is an occasional narrator and the story is technically extremely cliched
it is about a boy winning over a girl with charm and power
however he did not plan for this
it basically happened to him and he had no control over it
he becomes overshadowed by his own shadow and thats often what i say to describe the game
it perfectly explains the games ironyalong the way the boy meets a lot of people and saves a lot more people just like a fairy tale
except this is more of a modern day fairy tale i supposethe people in this game are simply infectiousthey have qualities that are unspeakably outstanding and they all interact very interestingly with each other
the only problem with the characters in this game is that they are so wonderful that i now hold the characters of a game as a very important aspect of it
and no characters have ever been able to live up to the ones in okage in my opinionthe side quests are very intricate and fun
they are far from simple but they arent so hard that you would need to use a walkthrough to finish themthe graphics are average for its time but thats not exactly the point of them
they are cute and really fit with the theme of the gamethe fight sequences are turn based and very standard
they are also decently challenging considering im an experienced gamer
the enemies are adorable and the attacks weapons and magic abilities are pretty normal
the fighting is not outstanding basically
and this would not be a problem for me if they werent so inescapable
you will fight a lot more enemies than you need to and you cant avoid it
that is my only complaint about this game
but sometimes stan your shadow will save you from another repetitive battle by instantly annihilating all of the enemies oh and that part is really fun when it happens to occur during a boss battle
the game has surprisingly unexpected plot twists and i say this because of how innocent the game is and how predictable the overall plot isin addition to stan killing all of the enemies in a battle in one fell swoop this game is stuffed with little quirks that make it all the more praiseworthy
for example you get to react to what people say and establish friendships that change the way certain things happen
they are a little out of the way and very subtle but its cute nonetheless
and there are a handful of random noteworthy things like that in the gameoverall this is not my favorite game because its graphics are surreal
its not my favorite because the battles are cool and interesting
and definitely not because its perfect
but in my opinion the flaws in this game other than the frequency of the battles which i really dont mind personally combine so well with the strengths of it that they dont seem like flaws at all
bottom line this game isnt something that people who are more mainstream fps players would be into
but if youre reading these reviews you probably dont fall into that category anyway
it is a bit difficult to put into words exactly why i love this game so much but i believe that it is beyond incredible
i very highly recommend it to all of my friendsand i have never once heard a single complaint from themthis game really leaves you w a sense of accomplishment the more you figure out and the farther you get
you grow stronger and pick up new friends
i did happen to get stuck and miss something important not have the guide look online realize i had to go back got lost and i really didnt want to restart the dungeon and retravel the ghost roads
i rerented this game  or  times and i really liked it but i got frusterated and never bought it
i reccommend it if you do everything in order and follow the guide
then its so much funa completely strange and completely boring rpg that has abseloutely no redeeming value
i highly suggest you avoid it
it may bite youokage shadow king is a terrific game in that it breaks the usual boy saves the world  girl from evil formula weve been seeing for the past few years in console rpgs
it also boasts some of the most impressive visual styling paying more than a little homage to tim burtons the nightmare before christmas and funniest dialog in any rpg within memory
still there are a few problemsthe story is that you are an average boy who gets trapped into becoming the host of an evil being from the past in order to save your spoiled sister from the dreaded pig latin curse
anyways this evil being who is named stan takes possession of your shadow and orders you out into the world with dreams of conquest
this may not seem like the setup for a comedic rpg but okage is very lighthearted and has more than its share of funny moments
you meet some very colorful characters along the way and the way they react to stan leads to some very interesting situationsthe problem with okage lies with its battle system
it is very simple and battles themselves are not all that entertaining
it makes me wonder why the developer chose to make an rpg out of this game instead of an actionadventure
a dungeon crawler like dark cloud or zelda seems more appropriate
also the load times are unacceptable given the graphical complexity of this game
despite being very visually inventive the polygon counts are low so there is no excuse for  second load times
this is especially noticeable in towns when you have to explore houses and even going from one room to another incurs a massive wait for loadingif youre looking for something different okage will provide you with a fun experience but expect a little tedium to accompany itgreat gamebetter story than mostgreat graphics for the time
arrived in less than  days and was a reasonable pricethought it was going to be a new copy and it ended being a little bit usedcd is pristine thoughi bought this game to complete my halo collection
the game is great for the price
i would recommend it to allthis game is really good but it kinda gets oldfor inctance all of the levels are very different and unique but they take too long and so the uniqueness is lost because you end up spending an hour on the same levelgraphics really great grahics  mostly any picture is screen shot worthyreplayability gets old as i saidplayability great controls gets boring thoughrestraints great how you can go all over the planet but the levels make it less open ended but this is a hard categorystory pretty basic aliens vs humans but they beef it up with robots and suchsubtoalbonus multiplayer setable difficultytotalthis is the game i bought xbox for and the first few days of having it in the console was pure gaming joy
the quotfeelquot of moving around in halo is fantastic the controls are easy to use and comfortable
the scenery is fascinating with wellrendered if not diverse aliens and weapons to be found throughout the environment
capping off the whole experience is the best vehicle driving interface ive experienced in a first person shooter
all that being said i want only one improvement in halo  one which would have garnered this game  stars  dont fill the middle of the story sequence with repetitive mission environments
there comes a point halfway perhaps a bit further through halo where you spend countless moments traversing the same damn hallway again and again
it seems a lazy oversight by the designer given the time this game took in production and the other overall general excellence that they couldnt muster a few different settings
an unfortunate blemish on what should have been a solid gema must have in the collection
great campaign missions
however once you beat the highest level i doubt if you will want to continue to play the campaings
but it is the best multiplayer shooting game yet
you will fall out laughing every time you hit one of your friends in the back of the head with your unit
the only reason i did not rate this game with  stars is that one player cannot play the computer in the multiplayer environment
if you you could it would be the best game ever made this is an average fps
graphics and sound are top notch but the weapons gameplay and storyline are nothing too interesting
this game does draw heavily from many scifi classics while playing youll be reminded of aliens predator stargate and the master cheifs suit looks a little too halflife
but on a technical standpoint this game puts all other fpss to shametheres no better shooter out there that even compares to this game
all the elements music game play graphics come together in this game like no other
this game is the main reason to have an xbox
to make things better
as of april st  the price of xbox will be dropped to 
plus halo  will be coming out this year amp its live
 of people have broadband
for  for the live kit
includes headset amp  year of live gaming experience takes on a whole new level
try it
you wont regret ita lot of people would disagree with me on this subject but halo is not a perfect game
there are problems with the level design and the graphics are far inferior to what they should be
however this game is still a truck load of fundo i really need to tell the story
sure why not
earth is at war with the covenant a bunch of bad alien dudes like there are ever friendly aliens in video games
after reach outpost falls to them and most of the spartans superhuman battle cyborgs are destroyed the covenant is at earths doorstep
desperate to draw them off the pillar of autum along with the last surviving spartan jump blindly into deep space and come out near the world halo
after a crash landing its up to master chief the player to help lead the guerilla war against the covenant and find out what halo isthis is in the end an elaborate excuse to kick some serious alien but
and kick it you will
the idea of only being able to carry two weapons at once was genius and makes the player think about what theyre likely to need in a certain part of the level
the weapons are all nifty
none really stand out except the needler but they all get the job done and the ability to use covenant weapons provides some cool varietyhowever the graphics really disappoint which is sad considering all their hype
for a system that is touted as the strongest in the current console war of which there has yet to be definite proof this game sure doesnt impress
the animation runs at a mere  frames per second and sometimes dips below that
the textures though used well are far to few especially for what the xbox is capable of
however things like this happen when a game is switched from one medium to another during development halo was originally going to launch on the pc
the visuals arent bad per say but they arent anywhere near what the system can and should handle
luckily bungie has learned from their mistake
check out the videos from halo  and youll see what im talking about
still there are certainly some great animations in here and the lighting is really goodunfortunately the level design gets repetitious especially past the halfway point of the game where you essentially play the first half of the game again in reverse order as you try to escape from the facility on halo
its still fun but it would have been nice to switch pace from heres another room full of aliens to kill every once in a while although the vehicular levels almost make up for it
it doesnt kill the gameplay but its kind of a let down after all the praise the game has been receivinghowever halo truly shines in its gameplay
it controls like a pc game and the xbox pad provided you have the smaller version not the buildingsized original works very well
it takes some getting used to if youre more used to goldeneyestyle settings but it really is the best it could be on a console
the aiming is easy and the weapons all have secondary functions
the ability to use vehicles was a nice touch and adds a nice layer to the experience
and the ai really is impressive
your fellow soldiers will lay down covering fire for you accompany you in vehicles and even dive for cover when grenades are thrown
the covenant troops will hide behind shields rockstrees or other troops throw grenades back at you and even imitate the death screams of the marines
listening to the grunts will provide some of the best laughs of the game ahh theyre everywhere
were all gonna die
little people first
there are some truly great moments to be had just from watching your opponentshalos second and arguably greater feat is the multiplayer
the maps are huge and the game modes are many
not only that but the vehicles are all available in multi as well adding all the more to the carnage you can inflict on your friends
however it would have been nice to see some bots added using the excellent ai from the game
sure the multi is fun but deathmatch can get old after long enough and it would be fun to sit down with four friends and just wage war against a squad of covenant troops
luckily for gamers who actually have friends there is a great coop mode with the entire game available to play through with a buddy
its a nice touch and adds a feel of being part of a team to the gameplay and a human will be an infinitely better backup man than your unfortunately human marinesall in all anyone who enjoys shooters should already own this game
if you dont go pick it up and you wont be sorryhail to the chiefyes its  and my wait is over
i had this game sitting on a shelf for almost a year and finally i took the time to fully enjoy itusually the first games that come out with the launch of a new game console are  there to show off its capabilities but they fade away into obscurity very quickly
halo is one of the very few exceptions to the rule and this is without a doubt the game that built xboxs reputation into what it is today hands downin my opinion the main factor in keeping me coming back to this game was pure playability
i didnt admire so much the landscapes the weapons the ai or even the great vehicles available for combat
what i really admired was the ease of playing and i mean playing not actually winning
the controls are comfortable the movements are smooth the feel is just perfectall games have room for improvement for me halo has its major flaw with the automatic checkpoint saves  the program automatically saves your progress at specific i call arbitrary spots during the game
i found myself going way back to a previous checkpoint after spending almost an hour of tough combat
this situation also brought another gripe sometimes i felt that certain parts were supposed to be completed in a seemingly specific way with no room for improvisation
a slight deviation in tactics and you ended up flying in the air and back to the last checkpoint
also if you did something wrong such as wasting ammo or grenades you had no way to backtrack into a more comfortable position
a couple of times i had to restart a level after finding myself in an exceedingly frustrating impossible checkpoint because of the lack of weapons and ammosound settings wouldve been a nice addition to the game
i often noticed that the music and sound effects volume didnt allow you to listen the game dialog clearly enough
dialog is important to succedd in more than a few missionsafter several days i was able to complete all the campaign missions in normal mode
i recommend a new player to start with easy
i believe normal mode is still a bit difficult for the average playerin the end halo for xbox is a truly exciting action game with many different combat options that will keep you hooked until the end
a must havei dont get what all the hype is about seriously
i dont
halo is a very good make that great game and i still play it a lot but from what ive read and heard about it i was expecting to be blown away
the tornado i was bracing for turned out to be a nice gentle breeze
throughout the entire game i was hoping and hoping but it never reached the state of being the greatest fps of all time or the best game for the xbox ever that i had been led to believe it would become
however thats not saying halo is a gigantic disappointment in any respect
i know people are going to start telling that when it was made halo was way ahead of its time
be that as it may i hear people saying that its still the greatest game ever made when in reality it isntall the levels except the moronic the library are large and designed nicely and arent as linear as in a lot of other games
the graphics are excellent even by todays standards
the weapons are realistic except the pistol which kicks the assault rifles butt somehow and the enemies are original intelligent and challenging
coop mode and multiplayer are both great
the vehicles are powerful although needlessly difficult to drive it would be much better if buttons were used for acceleration and braking and the thumbstick was used for steering
the storyline is interesting and the game is very welldesigned overall
but unfortunatley i dont seem to be able to find that certain spark that captured so many other players attention and made them fall in love with this game no matter how hard i try
many people seem to worship halo but i dont see what the big deal is
it might be my own fault or maybe im just confused but i dont think halo is as wonderful as its made out to be
seriously though dont get me wrong
halo is a great firstperson shooter just not the greatesti know very little about video gamesbut i love playingthis game with friends
its an exciting shoot em up game thatll provide hours of funwe picked up halo combat evolved right after we got our xbox  because my son wanted to start at the beginning of the halo series
this is a fairly fun shooter that has spawned at least five additional games and even a fairly well written series of books halo books  the flood first strike the fall of reach which were actually fairly good and follow this games plot line closelyyou are controlling the master chief a heavily armored and physically augmented spartan super soldier
the various missions range rescuing a computer artificial intelligence to destroying important ancient relics all the while battling hordes of covenent soldiers a large variety of species and the creepy flood very menacing opponents indeedafter many hours of game play here are my observationsgreat storyline very involved and engagingintuitive controls easy to learn and well thought outok replay value changing the difficulty settings provides increased challengesgraphics good but not great by newer game standardstwo player mode very fun but the splitscreen is a little confusing for me followwhile not critical to the enjoyment of the later games it does provide the events that they build on and it is also fun to playrecommendedcfhfirst let me get this out of the way the hype for this game is too much
the only way bungie the games makers could have met the hype is if god was on their support staff and the main character rolled around on a segway personal transportation unitthat said halo is an excellent firstperson console shooter
the controls take a little while to master but youll quickly learn to appreciate the beautiful graphics and wonderful sound effects and voices
probably the quotepiphany momentquot for me was discovering that all the ingame cutscenes the parts that advance the story were done with the games engine and not prerendered graphics
the fact it took so long for me to figure this out is indiciative of the polish put into the gamedefinitely a rental if not a purchasegreat great game
best shooting game i have ever played
incredible graphics great interactive game play
great story
makes you wish halo  was out alreadythe only thing that was not that great in my opinion were the zombie like characters later in the game
i think they detracted from a game that had incredible beutiful graphics and scenes
i hope halo  dumps the stupid zombiesi loved the game beat it twice with my friend nic
but there was one thing that really stankthe weapon selection was thin as was the vehical selection
and i think the master chief had just a little to much ability  to resist enemy fire
i was hoping for more of a battle filled game with more veriaty of weapons and power ups
but i did like the grenades
in other fpss you have to hav ethe grenade as a weapon
in halo you can shoot then throw a grenade when needed
this game also only has four main enemies with one other type
the flood
but each type of allian race has about two or three different levels of itdo not buy this game wait for the second onewith graphics that are comparable to james bond agent under fire with slightly better textures and cheesy often childish sound effects its a wonder this game is a popular as it is
i am not a fan of first person shooters and here is why control
this game needs to be on a pc
it has a very mouse and keyboard feel to its control set up a set up that does not work well with a control paddle
still despite these quips halo manages to be a very good story with a lot of possibilities
i have not finished the game but despite my complaints i will probably have to at some point buy it
maybe when the price goes down
for future installments it is my hope that microsoft will remember that the xbox is a console not a pc and will develop more console userfriendly controls in the vein of goldeneye in the future
they may also want to consider not having than baddies laughing maniacally as youre blasting them into tiny pieces
i will probably buy the pc version so i can use the mouse and keyboard
it will feel less awkward to meexcellent
i would give it  stars but it angered methat i couldnt control my character with the dpad
using the sticks just isnt the sametoo touchy and jerkyim mostly into racing games and i just cant get into thesticks for shooter gamesbut on the plus side the game itselfwas so insanei had no choice but to play itwhether i likedthe controls or noti was damn well gonna play ittired if you ask me
bought it sold it within a weekhalo is absolutly  the worst game on any system
the graphics are terrible and the plot line is horendous
the multieplayer mode adds extra stuff and it is crummy also
here is the truth about halo
graphics yuk
it moves  sec
per frame instead of  but still they are amazing
gameplayi think ill be sick it didnt win that title the best ever for a reason and this is whyit is super short and a pain in the but to beat
fun factor very very dull
it is a shooting thriller and thats about it
it is incredibly stupidoverall it is a must buy
badjob by microsfotwe expect betterdang i really really wish this game would come out on gamecubeoh wellthis game looks awesome
sadly for me i cant play it on a count of my owning a gamecube and not an xbox
i mean dont get me wrong gamecube is the best darn system i have ever played
but this gamefrom what i have heard it is the best shooter there is and i have read a lot of reviews on all the new games for all the new systems and this is probly my number  on the list of games i wish were on gamecube
speaking of which i think ill just go ahead and list thoes gameshaloxboxfinal fantsy xpsoddworld munchs oddeseyxboxgrand theft auto psmetal gear solid psactually thats about itso anyway this game looks like one of the best and definatly the best for xboxas my ending note xbox and ps are great but gamecube rocks the housegreat fun and good enough to convert all those nonfps fansi didnt like fpss until i played halo
i had played quake and red faction both of which had average graphics and game play
but halo is a game that is so addictive it could take over your spare time and convert you into a fpsloving fanatic
the graphics are often breathtaking  there is so much detail that without exception everything looks better up close
the bark on the trees looks so real that you feel like stripping it off and making a bonfire whilst singing kumbaya and toasting marshmallows with your fellow marines
when a grenade explodes dirt fountains up in the air in a spectacular fashion giving you a new appreciation of soil
the waterfalls look so good that you wish you had a camera
rocks look like rocks
the list is endless
the game play is great fun with some awesome weapons and vehicles  the scorpion tank ranks as one of the best vehicles ever in a video game  as well as an incredible cooperative mode that is five times more fun than playing alone
all the weapons have their uses and despite being limited to carrying two at a time there are so many weapons littered about the levels that it hardly mattershalo is basically divided up into two halves  the first five levels you battle the covenant whilst in the last five levels you battle both the flood and covenant
the covenant is an amusing bunch of aliens whilst the flood are mutantzombies who overtake the bodies of their victims
occasionally youll come across flood and covenant forces engaged in epic battles and it is up to you whether you want to help sway the outcome of the battle wipe everyone out with guns blazing or simply stand back and watch the outcome
fighting the covenant is fun since they are welldesigned and seemingly have a lot of personality  the grunts especially will cry out sayings such as  die devil die
  run away
  hes going to kill us all
  theres two of them
whilst fighting the covenant i felt some joy at massacring large numbers of an alien civilization
they cried they grunted they shouted with rage as i continuously pummeled them with gunfirethe first five levels are the best particularly levels three four and five
its in the first half of the game that you mostly fight on battlefields with your other marines enjoying the intensity of war
halo really shines when the action takes place on an open battlefield with covenant aircraft and hovercraft zooming around  that is until you whip out your rocket launcher and destroy them
even better is the fun that can be had with the sniper rifle taking out covenant elite or gun emplacements before they even see you
shooting your own men is also a hoot especially blowing them up with plasma grades
i love watching a marine waving his arms wildly in the air whilst running around in circles and shouting oh god oh god oh god
 just before he blows up and another marine turns to me and says you killed him man
if you kill too many of your own men they turn on you and thats about the only time in the game when cursing is heard
the oaths arent anything that you wouldnt hear on an episode of friends
your marines will also compliment you on your fighting ability saying things such as nice shot
or hes unstoppable
they also say mildly amusing things
one marine will say see
theyre not so tough and another will reply i hear some of them are wearing skirts
my favorite level is number five with some amazing snow effects and a large variety of vehicles and weapons
level four is the exact same as the demo level
the demo level was on normal difficulty
halo is an entirely different experience when you play it on the legendary difficulty level
on legendary you have to play very defensively and the tension as you duck constant barrages of plasma bolts is palpable
several times i found myself with sweaty hands
other levels include settings such as alien ships beaches cliff faces swamps and seemingly endless corridors
levels   and  are repeats of levels   and  respectively which is a slight letdownoverall a great game and the best i have played on either xbox or ps
definitely worth a purchaseits a lot like turok  and halflife
i think it actually had more dinosaurs than turok  though
the multiplayer is fun especially coop missions but  players arent enough for good multiplayer
the storyline is derivative and that makes me tune out and care less
there are many dull moments in mazes of corridors where the areas are repetitive and that contributes to getting lost andor bored
level design is bland technocrap though sometimes perfectly epiclooking
you essentially open locked doors and search in between enemies and thats just not good gameplay
its best when there are many vehicles and enemies around with friends playing with you open areas are numerous and dry
single player is  somewhat tedious coop multi can be great but the graphics are smaller and enemies harder to hit i wont praise the game just for multi
multiplayer vs isnt worth it unless you have  or  people and controllers on
i think controlling the warthog should be easier and more weapons should have a scope
i liked how the marines would speak to you during the game but they just say goofy stuff
you cant use your own music ingame either
i wish there was one weapon w infinite bullets
overall this is a pretty good shooter but rent to see if its for you or not first i wish it had more battles in larger outdoor levels and better gameplay surrounding them
what really bothers me is that people say this is the xboxs answer to rares masterpiece goldeneye  when it isnt
ultimately its just so overratedthis game has a great storyline and i have enjoyed the character development as well as gameplay but the thing that kept me from giving this game  stars was the controlsmy biggest pet peeve is a game with controls so complicated that you spend more time learning the controls than you do defeating the gamethat said this game isnt quite that bad
the only difficult thing is using the two thumbsticks for movement see an xbox controller if youre not familiar
the left thumbstick is all movement
up and down moves you forward and backward while left and right strafe move sideways without turning
the right thumbstick is for head movements
up and down look up and down while right and left look right and left
if you want to go around a left corner and actually be facing any enemies there you have to press forward with the left thumbstick and left with the right thumbstick
the reason it is annoying is this if you accidentally find yourself pressing the slightest bit forward or backward when you are turning left or right you will be staring at the sky or ground instead of your enemies
until i learned the controls well i kept dyingdang this game is good
it looks good better than nearly any console game ive seen
it sounds good having nice effects and a good soundtrack
it feels good with nice controls and the xboxs amazing controller
it just is good
the story is engrossing and the gameplay is great
i havent had this much prolonged fun with a single nonrpg console game in a long time
why didnt i give it  stars
because im not a huge fan of firstperson shooters in general
and thats the only reasonas far as i can tell theres only a couple very minor problems with the game
you cant use a keyboard and mouse which isnt much of a problem because of the good controller setup
also the game doesnt support xboxs soundtracking feature
it would be great to blast a bunch of covenant forces with metallica roaring through my stereo as part of the gameif you have an xbox and you dont completely hate firstperson shooters you should get this game
if you have an xbox and you like fps you absolutely must get this game
if you dont have an xbox and like the genre you should definitely consider picking the console and game upin case you needed a road map this is the launch title to own
remember how you felt the first time you layed your hands on metal gear
tekken
mk
doom
sonic
mario
 anyone remember space invaders
you get the point now get the gameit is great to go back and play some of these games and see how far the games have goneif you are into scifi and shooters then this is for you
i played it through to the end but it didnt capture me as much as other games do
i would beat a level here and there and eventually beat the game
those dang warthogs are a pain to drive though
geesh
but the graphics and cutscenes are wonderful
recommendedthis game so far is the best first person game ever created for xbox
simply go around blasting the heck out of mutated aliens that have landed on earth
a wide range of weapons you can choose from and the multiplayer coooperative play and split screen is beeeeeeeeeeeyond aweeeeeesome
you can also enter vehicles like the night goast which hoveres over the ground or a wide range of onland vehicles
the other reason i like it is because you can run people over with the onland vehicles like the jeep
the reason why i give this game  stars is because the graphics could be improved and there could be a little more weapons plus i whish that the missions were a little easier to beat and you could actually create your own player and set its attributes like how fast it moves the limit of weapons it can carry etcin all get this game
it is great if you dont like this feed yourself to max paynealthough games are beyond the original halo now i dont think there will be any that will draw so many people in this game in my opinion is what made xbox succeed
system link with  friends was the greatest thing i had seen a game be able to do
multiplayer was hours upon hours of funhalo is a tricky game to review
on one hand its an fps on a console which any gamer knows is typically a bad combination
on the other hand the production value of the game is very highthat said i give the game  stars for fun and  stars overall
if it werent for the incredible attention to detail great cinematics sound story etc the gameplay alone would certainly not warrant  starsi am a huge fan of fps games
aside from espns football series and a few other miscellaneous titles i dont even use my xbox much because i spend my game time on my pc
thats not to say that pcs are better than consoles blah blah blah im saying that pcs and consoles lend themselves well to certain types of games
for instance youll never see me playing madden or tiger woods on my computer
likewise youll rarely see me playing an fps game on my consolehalo almost succeeded where most have miserably failed creating an fps that is viable on the console
what impresses me most about halo is not the graphics its the fact that its the first fps game ive played on the console that is actually easy to control
unfortunately easy to control doesnt always equate to fun
i know im going against the tide but i just didnt get attached to halo the way some people seem to
the graphics may have been great a few years ago when the xbox launched but today i dont see any level of detail that cant be found in other games
in some respects theyre even a little subpar
now with limited ram and a limited gpu by todays standards one could very easily argue that these graphical limitations are the result of hardware limitations
for instance to its praise halo offers expansive environments with a lot happening onscreen all at once
obviously thats resource intensive and other games that look better def jams fight for ny and espns nfl come to mind were probably able to achieve better graphical quality because the environments were significantly smaller
so understand that im not placing my disappointment in the graphics on the shoulders of the developers but rather on the shoulders of hardware that doesnt permit superior graphical quality and wide open environments all at oncethis is one reason why i believe fps games are better suited for the pc
ive been spoiled by pc fps games that have had far superior graphics such as rainbow six raven shield and ut
the developers of these games were able to take advantage of a much larger pool of memory cpu and much more advanced gpusso ive been harping on the graphics a bit but we all know that gameplay is perceived as the bottomline though i would argue that good graphics lend themselves to better gameplay since they help you to immerse yourself in the experience
i mentioned that the controls were easy to handle very easy in fact
well i found the gameplay a little boring
i cant quite put my finger on why i felt that way  especially since the games gameplay mechanics have been praised so much by others  but i think its based on the fact that its almost too easy to target your enemies very large hitboxes
the problem goes back to this being an fps on a console you cant make targeting too difficult by shrinking the hitboxes because aiming your crosshair with a thumbstick is inherently awkward to begin with
its a catch and in my opinion is a big reason why consoles just dont lend themselves well to fpsim sure this is going to be seen as some sort of insult to consoles and console gamers but you folks will just have to get over that
its not an insult its an observation
like i said earlier  i own a pc and i own a console
each has its own job to do
the pc runs the shooters and the console runs the sports driving and fighting gamesthats what each does bestmy son loved this game
however he loves anything halo
it seems he plays this halo version less than he plays the othersgreat game for a great console
some of the stages get a tad bit convoluted and might turn out to be a bit frustrating
overall an excellent first person kind of game
worth the moneythink starwars meets aliens and thats halo
this game is a science fiction fans dream come true
if you get any game for xbox get halo youll have a hell of time
warning this game is addictivei havent purchased this i rented it from the video store but i may get this just to do the multiplayeri beat this game in two days but it was because i was addicted to it
it has a good story it and is a very good first person shooterdownsidessaves could be a little better
you can quotsave amp quitquot at any time but it doesnt necessarily mean you will leave where you left offyou can only two weapons at a time
i wish i could carry the rifle shotgun and the alien pistolother than that this game is awesomei have played this game quite a lot and i have found that it is the greatest game ever
before playing halo i wasnt a big fan of the fps games but this one is great
the graphics are amazing with rich and detailed levels and the sound is great with gunfire and aliens screaming and your marines cheering you on when you do something well
i think the best part of this game is not the one player mode but the cooperative mode
my friend and i played for hours because it was so much fun
although the game is difficult even on normal you get better at it as you go along
one nice feature is that you can play your single player games in coop and vice versa
this is great for when there is a level you cant beat by yourself but then do it with a friend and beat it
antoher fun aspect of the game is that you get to use a jeep warthog a tank a small aircraft ghost and at one point a larger aircraft banshee
these are very useful and are integrated nicely into the game
one last fun thing is that you have marines along with you to help you you arent the only one out there
i would reccomend this game to everyone that has an xbox except for young kids under  and people who hate shooting gamesive played most of halo i by now
it reminds me of the metroid i had in the super nintendo
only that ms made it d
think about it a guy in an astronaut suit and killing weird aliens in other planets
the music is mysterious metroid like too
im sure the metroid in d in nintendo gc offers more variety with monster at the end of a level etc
anyway halo i also has quake ii stuff the walls and futuristic things are reminiscent of quake
nothing original about halo i however it shines in the control precision and smoothness
the game is  years old now
nothing better than playing a game after many years to see if it got rotten like an egg or aged like a fine wine
the graphics look primitive but its the controls and the shooting experienced where the game really stands out and stood the test of time
all in all the game feels too empty and boring to be fun but the controls are the best ive seenall i can say is this game is awesome
it has a nice story line beautiful graphics and awesome multiplayer
multiplayer includes vehicles and several fun maps some are almost too big though
what i say as lacking though is the fact that you can only carry  weapons at a time and the fact that multiplayer unlike unreal tournament does not have comp opponents you must play with others
the weapons are well balanced with human and alien weapons and a variety of vehicles from a dune buggy to a bike and tanks
multiplayer does have the problem of it is hard to see people and the radar is not very far stretching since the maps are really big it may be impossible to see who shoots you at times
the single player is fun though the missions are very different and involve teams and vehicles as well as fixed emplacements
you can also get deep into this game
other than a few small complaints though this game is fantastic for multiplayer and pretty good single but mainly it is a  player dreamhalo is truly spectacular on a widescreen tv and  dolby digital sound system
i am at a lost for wordshalo combat evolved was the best xbox game ever in my opinion when it was still relatively new
first time i ever played it was at my friends house and i had such a blast
it was fun playing story mode with a friend and the multiplayer maps were awesome
i favored the maps that held vehicles sidewinder blood gulchthe story mode was and still is great to play though since i have beaten it numerous times in the past years its not as exciting mainly because i know what to expect now
thats why when i do play it i try and find funnyinteresting things to do
i like playing around with the hunters one of my favorite baddies and the armless flood that follow you around and cant hurt you
its fun to see how many of them you can get to follow you
i think the most ive gotten was three or twothis version of halo would be considered outdated since most people are playing halo  or  the newer versions
but this game is what started it all
without combat evolved there probably wouldnt be a  or  neither sequels have a better story line i think and the spartan armor is cool and better looking than the armor in the second halofew things i dislike about this game is that you cant be an elite
 and you cant fight against bots which would be very awesome if you could
every game that has multiplayer should have a bot optionhalo for the records is a good firstperson shooter but not a greatly exceeding one
halo uses fine sound incredible graphics and extraordinary game play that leaves you breathless in your first five minutes of action
the hype did live up and halo is funbut there is the con to it
there are only four kinds of alien enemies and they are more cute and dangerous
the weapons are very well created but there isnt a variety of them only a pistol shotgun rocketlauncher and rifle
you can use your enemys weapon and find out they are much better
the use of vehicles in the game add a little more and makes the game good
its fun and will delight the child in all of us but theres just not as much to choose from what you start with in the level youll end with making the overall experience blandwhat more could i say about this game that hasnt been said
if you like shooting games you will like this gamehalo  circa good balanced gameplay make or edited your own multiple player matches considered classic to many video gamers today ai
is challenging but not overpoweringbad some story mode levels feel a little empty sometimes gameplay feels a little repetitive lack of real variety in enemies liner level design story seems a little lacking you have to fill in a lot of your own impetration small amount of multiple player mapsif it fits your taste scifi military fps where you fight off an alien race who wants you dead similar to starship troopers aliens alien  only get to carry  weapons at a time drive vehicles such as tanks jeeps and alien spacecraft no online play so system link seems the way to go coop play only on system link or spilt screen availablegame its most assocated too halo  doom  perfect darkadditional notes there is a funny online show called red vs blue which loosely based on halo this is the second console tile for bungie who released in association with rockstar who is know for grand theft auto oni on ps ps
oni was not that good this game is also for pc
and it has more maps online play and new weaponsi came very late to the halo experience mostly because i didnt have the capabilities of investing in xbox live
my tv and xbox is upstairs my cable is downstairs and plugging the xbox into the cable box downstairs would require me to drill holes in the floor yadda yaddawell along came wireless networks
i finally decided to convert my computer tivo and xbox to wireless thereby skipping the awkward problem of cables between floors
my wife surprised me the halo collection one day i love my wife and just like that i was playing halo  online
but this review is about the campaign which i just finished yesterdayhalo follows the story of master chief steve downes a cyborg awakened for the sole purpose of kicking alien butt
he is ordered around by captain jacob keyes pete stacker and the sassy artificial intelligence hologram cortana jen taylor
we never get to see what master chief looks like because he always wears a helmet
this makes him alternately customizable that could be you under that helmet
and strangely impersonalmaster chief is part of an ongoing war against the aliens known as the covenant
who exactly theyve made a covenant with is uncertain
these aliens range from squat comical grunts to the doglike jackals from the predatory elites to the behemoth hunters
the covenant ambushes master chiefs ship the pillar of autumn and it ultimately crash lands on the ancient ring world known as halo
but that ring is there for more than decoration and both the covenant and the human forces are in for a nasty surprisehalo has it all from a veritable geekgasm of detailed human weapons torn right from the aliens space marine playbook to ground and air vehicles that can inflict even more destruction
marines shout orders and follow master chiefs lead just like starship troopers
to paraphrase hell comes to frogtown everyone is there to kick alien posterior and chew bubblegumand theyre all out of bubblegumhalo is drenched with testosterone a product so perfectly targeted to adolescent boys that i actually created master chief as a comic book that i published incidentally long before the xbox even existed
thats right brenkin kree wore a featureless helmet carried a rocket launcher on his shoulder and had a wristwatch computer named babe who bossed him around
just like master chief he was bred specifically for wardid halo rip me off
as much as my ego would like to think otherwise i sincerely doubt it
halo is merely the distilled perfection of every boys dream the biggest badass in town thrust into an aliens flick and armed with all the military might of the futurein retrospect halo is surprisingly mundane
mostly cortana comes up with new missions and tells master chief what to do
theres very few twists but plenty of old standbys kill this target rescue this person flip a switch and kill lots of aliens while doing it
the vehicle missions tweak this paradigm a bit but not by much
mostly i survived by having master chief smash his vehicle into the bad guys jump out and run for his life while spraying the countryside with hellfire
shake well and repeatthe character scripts are well done but good scripts are now standard fare for most firstperson shooters
we expect the marines to act intelligently the bad guys to act even more intelligently and the drones to act like morons
as my wife is fond of pointing out the grunts are funny and stupidlooking so it makes it okay to kill themthe voice acting is passable
taylors voice acting in particular is uneven she ranges from sedately reading her lines to infusing them with far too much enthusiasm sometimes in the same breath
since shes critical to the plot this is a major flaw in the game
because her commentary is only loosely tied to whats actually going on in the game i often had difficulty understanding what she wanted me to do
sorry cortana did you say thats an awfully big pit dont fall in it or thats an awfully big pit jump in it
this led to several frustrating moments where i didnt know what the hell was going on and just ran around until either cortana flat out told me or i figured it out myselftheres a few things that make halo different
for one master chief has a personal shield that regenerates quickly over time
this means that barring a series of sudden attacks master chief will always survive this is a difficult adjustment for someone new to the multiplayertheres no slow sniping its either oneshot onekill or nothing
master chief can apparently leap tall buildings in a single bound but the jumping mechanism isnt particularly precisewhich can be deadly in the wrong situation
finally the same mechanics that give air vehicles a weightless feeling also applies to ground vehicles making them maneuver more like gliding hovercraft than actually  ton road hogscompared to todays standards halos merely a good game
but back when it first debuted it was a great game
i enjoyed experiencing a bit of gaming history
well see how halo s campaign stacks upits time for an honest opinion of the game that xbox owners tout constantly without pause halo
first things first there is next to nothing original about this game
rather it seems more an experiment in refinement
everything in this game has a very strong level of balance to it and it doesnt seem that besides graphics and in some cases sound that bungie took really big risks with this game
there arent any bots to speak of networked play has been around for years either on the pc or playstation  there are few weapons to really speak of enemy variety is also hurting and the ai is fantastic but merely represents one of the best around not a higher echelon in enemy intelligence
multiplayer alas i havent been able to play much of and though it does show a lot of promise especially with the vehicles and options is pretty much as extravagant as perfect dark the last game to define this genre and really push boundaries
people have also said that this takes the narrative of fps to a new level
you cant really claim theyre the first to go to this depth with the story however as both nintendo and sierravalve have pushed the envelope on fps stories with their respective pefect dark and halflife
control is nearperfect save the clunky movement for vehicles but doesnt make any leaps over other console fpss then again if it aint brokethis brings me to the only two advancements that halo makes in the way of shooters graphics and sound
these are merely aesthetic details too but i will give halo credit as it is the best looking game i have ever played barnone
while it doesnt have the graphical variety of later gamecube games like metroid and wind waker everything has a gritty look to it here and bumpmapping does make for some great eyecandy
physics are terrific as well and the shadows cannot be matched by any other game
reflections are also superb and the people in the game are modeled with painstaking detail
your jaw will drop at the opening cinema when you see the captains facialm movements and expressions
everything just seems to have its proper place in the game and that really helps in drawing you into the admittedly wellcrafted starship troopersesque storyline
sound alas is also pretty friggin good
ricchochets of bullets and the roars of the covenant as you bring them down are pleasing to the ear as well as other ambient effects
the music while sparse becomes heartpoundingly intense at just the right times
the voice acting throughout is also wellcast
it does manage to set a bar for shooter audio that will be hard to matchthese things being said i have no doubt in my mind that halo isnt one of the greatest games to come out in awhile
yet my friends its just one game on a system that really doesnt offer much besides that one game
munchs oddysee is about the only other game that acheives anything noteworthy or memorable unless you count doaebvs bouncinguhvolleyball but beyond that the waters pretty tepid in xbox country
im guessing thats why this is all xbox owners have to talk about its the only thing thats still keeping them entertained
really guys if you want things to be excited about get a gamecube or at least a ps
its been almost a year and a half now calm down alreadyfor the firstperson shooter fps fan halo will seem like a dream come true
it has one of the best ais ever awesome graphics terrific length and great controls
also the mulitplayer modes are what make halo so great
between capture the flag and slayer on a system link a group of kids will have a blast playing halo if they are fortunate enough to have two halos two xboxs two tvs and a system link cable
another element which makes halo so great is the variety of weaponry and vehicles
you can throw two different types of grenades
shoot from a number of different guns and drivefly in four different vehicleshowever even though many people will hate me for this halo is not perfect
all of the maps in each level are very similar
meaning although each level is unique individually inside of each level everything looks the same
also in many of the levels the scenary is dark very dark
many times you will need to pause the game and raise the brightness level on your tv just to see your oponents
also at many times during a specific level halo can get boring because it can get repetitive
dont get me wrong most of the levels are so unique and so action packed that it is nonstop fun
on the other hand there are one or two levels where u do the same exact thing the entire level ex in one level you follow a blue monitor fight a group and aliens follow the monitor fight again etc
although there are some downs and ups of halo the average gamer will absolutely love it
it is nonstop action from beginning to end
however the gamer who totally detests firstperson shooters might not like halo that much
because of these reasons i believe that halo is one of the if not the most overrated games of all time
however that doesnt keep it from being a winnerhalo combat evolved one of the best games gamers can get for xbox the game starts in year  earth became over populated and humans needed somewhere to live so people started colonizing other worlds
thats when humans found halo
the covenant  halos aliens religious elders and covenant warriors arranged a holy war upon humanity
can the marines and the crew defeat the covenant and their strong forces or will they need something stronger like a master chief
halo combat evolved the covenant is everywhere grunts jackalselithsand even the big oneshunters
this is more game action than gamers can handle
gamers are the master chiefleading the squald as gamers go through the game and try to stay alive
can gamers defeat the covenant and not die
halo combat evolved is rated m for mature
since this game is rater mature ask your parents for permission before gettingfirst putting it in i was amazed
was amazed
after beating the game  about  hrs  i found it to get boring but the multi play for with your friends is where the hidden jem is for this game
this game was clearly made for when xbox goes online
so make sure you dust this off after  months and give it a trythere were some monotonous parts the library and has two control mechanisms i hated crouching by constantly holding the joystick button down and driving vehicles should have been like gta it would be simpler but otherwise i couldnt put it down
especially worth it now that you can get it used for  buckshalo is still the main reason to get an xbox
it has garnered much praise for its excellent graphics incredible ai and good story
however a few things hold this shooter back from being truly revolutionaryprosgreat graphicsgreat pricesmart aifour difficulty levelsyou can play coop
awesome multiplayeryou can ride around in vehicles such as tanks and jeepsgood voice acting and storyconsthe single player levels all seem the same
many textures environments and settings are used over and over again
it gets insanely repetitive to go through the similar looking areas over and over again this is why the game gets  starsthere needs to be more weapons
i believe there is something like  of them in the game
while they are excellently balanced more would have been niceall in all halo is still a must buy
it is fun and if you have a bunch of friends over is a blast
the repetive environments are the only bad thing in the game
buy this game immediatly invite over  friends and let the party beginhalo played in sinlge player is a pretty average scifi fps compared to similar pc games not really any better than quake  or  in the cooperative mode it becomes a great two man game
as a multiplayer game halo is nothing short of a social phenomenon
eight on eight fighting parties take place every weekend in every dorm room in americahalo is by far one of the best shooters of all time
it has a great campaign mode
the only thing i dont like about the halo is the multiplayer modesthey are just really not that fun
the only multiplayer level i really enjoy is bloodgulch
it is great to play if you have  person over or if you have  people over
but overall halo is a really great gamei thoroughly enjoyed this game
very deep plot and loved the jeep driving ending
even though the middle parts of the game was repetitive and the jeep was hard to drive a great game overall in its timei have this game for xbox 
i have beat it on single player and cooperative mode with a buddie 
its a good game but i beat the game in three days 
its a long game but it doesnt take long to get through it 
the game is fun battling the covenant 
but it gets better later on when the flood comes in to the game 
then its a real challange as you battle them both 
the levels are big and are fun but sometimes the indoor levels get boring at times
the funnist part of the game is that you get to drive awsome stuff like the warthog  ghost and banshee 
also your marines will help you when driving the warthog they will jump in the side and in the back to gun down the covenant
if you want a good combat game and something to play with your buddies then get haloi remember gttin this game last christmas w the xbox an man every day after school i would play this forever with my friend on coop
the story takes place where you a spartan ii awake in the middle of a war against an alien race known as the covanent and you are forced to evacuate and end up on the ring world of halo then u can figure out the rest for yourself
or sometimes my friends and i will go against each other usaully sidewinder for the glitch
get this game an go coop with your friends vs your frinds in multiplayer supports lan or take on halo by yourself with choosing one of the four difficulties easyno gernade using required jus shoot da covanent down an feel like the terminator as you watch the covanent fall before you
normalgettin more serious
some gernade using required and you mjay die here or there even on coop but funner than easy
heroicthis is almost insane but my friend and i got thru it me alone playing i can only beat it on easy an normalalot of gernade using here
plenty more blood this time
legendary bumm bumm bumm bummmmmm
this is suicide
heres halo at its max
get ready
me an my other friend beat the first and last i was eager to see the secret ending
youll run out gernades for sure
blood baths everywhere
i suggest u bring a buddy along so it wont be immpossible and not as stressing
get this game if you havent already cause not only are there spoilers spoilers
 levels of action packed gameplay and its only  at gamestop the game is over  worth
if you just cant get an xbox no need to fear
theres always halo for pcand look for halo  coming soon
cyaupdate ugh i wanted to rate this a  not a 
error on my part sry psince growing up playing on my atari oddysey prenes i have rarely come across a game which excels in every aspect the way halo does
in everything from gameplay amp replay value to graphics story amp soundtrack every facet of the game is superb
this game is a musthave for anyone with an xbox amp for those that dont have one it is a reason to get onethe whole halo bandwagon fanboy fag crap and all this other halo crap is really getting boring
now they got books and halo  is getting more hype then san andreas ever did
so why do people like this game so much
because you shoot aliensthis game is so basic i could of invented it
it is the best shooter on xbox but it is nowhere near what goldeneye was on the n
sure everybody loves halo because it was the best game on xbox and some kids still think it is
goldeneye started shooters and no game will ever be better
i am not just saying this because you shoot aliens but a simple alien storyline gets pretty boring after a while
halo was fun but now it is out of control
i am not like that other guy but i would rather shoot real people then shoot aliens
the plotline in goldeneye was so much better and the guns were betterthe storyline is that you are a magical thing that is a captain of a spaceship and you are sent down to kill aliens
now the game is impossible and your health meter refills automatically
this is good but it was invented because they made it hard
the guns are subpar and not as good as goldeneye which had real guns instead of little play guns that shoot green crap out of them
the game has its ups because you can drive and has a great multiplayer but it is not as good as driving a tank in goldeneye running over somebody
goldeneye has a better storyline and better levels sad that goldeneye came out in the late s and halo came out for xboxbut it is fun thats why it has  stars
but the game is not as good as goldeneye because goldeneye had better guns a realistic plot bad n graphixs and it started the shooter genre
so halo fans hate me and give me  negative votes but you all know which game is better and its not thisalrightthis is gonna be a review thats gonna say it all this is also gonna be different from my other reviewsthis game is overrated because of one thingtheve never saw a great fps for along timefor example goldeneye or perfectdark
or possably they never even enjoyed a great fps game before
not like those crapped up onesthis solves the wayyyy over rated problemthe graphic engine sometimes gets to peoples nerves cause its  frame per second
right correct it is  frameratebut people that play goldeneye or those other fps fans will not even notice it
in shortthis is the best framerate everbut people that watch closely will experience a tiny slowratebut in truth this games graphic has possably one of the best graphics for an fps gamesund people of those fantasy will love this music junk
its not like one of those rockhiphop and rap like gunit
people that like fantasy music not like the lonly ffx music will enjoy this
but for the people that enjoy gunitcwatever will not enjoy this
but as for the assualt rifle or any sound like that captures itotherwordsflawlessdislikers its true that this is from the alien covernant or some idiotic terms like that
in other words this is why i rated it a  in the first place
i dont like the fact that im versing uhhhummm  inch alien that screams at the top of his lungs
and aliens that slap you silly
hh and dont forget the parasite that looks like popcornif your not of scifi or dont even like aliens but like fps gamesits best to rent it firstactually its best to rent everygame you thinking of buying b you buy ittruly if your a ps fan than tell mewhat fps is better than halo for ps ehh
ehhh
red faction o common its too short
and has bosseshalflife yahright
it doesnt stand a chanceredfaction woahits in xboxso thats ur answervery nice first person shooter once you get the control down pat its a fun ride and extremely entertaining only small gripe i have is that some of the human characters look so bad its almost funny
its really wierd cause everyhting else in this world is gorgeous
is it a system seller i dont think so but i do think its a must have if you already own the system
its got some replay value as wellhalo was one of my first games for xbox and it is my brothers favorite
it is long but very fun
it isnt too hard either to complete a level and the controls are fairly easy to learn
it is great if you have a friend to play with because then you can help each other get through all of the levelspros great graphics great multiplayer or single player game large amount of items just plain fun fun vehicles such as warthog car with guns tank realistic for example if you throw a grenade and go near it you die
if you friend uses a melee attack on you get hurt
if you vehicle is shot at many times it dieshovercrafts and ships that actually flycons quite violent for younger children fairly long levels and in multiplayer mode you cannot saveas you can see a great game
if you have a friend you better be careful because they can hurt you ever if it is cooperative
 ive had my brother abandon me a bunch of times because he felt like it or so he says then hed take off with the only car in the game
however i completely recommend this gamethis game is one of the reasons why you should by an x box from its impressive visuals to its excellent sound shows how powerfulthex box isthe ai is excellent the wepons you get and the vehicles you get to ride is greatbut what makes this game the best is its gameplay and its story line it is going to suck you in and not let you go until you are done and still you would want to check out the multiplayer options from coop mode to the head to head such as capture the flagorignal death match etcthere is one problem the game ocassionaly hiccups in two player coop modethis game alone is worth buying xbox itselfif you have an xbox and dont have this game you should run to the store right now dont walk but runbeing new to the xbox  i had been wanting to try out the halo franchise that garners so much praise and hype
however never owning an original xbox instead having both a playstation  and a gamecube i figured it would be best to start off with the first game of the series
so i recently purchased halo combat evolved for the xbox
the game plays quite well on the xbox  with the exception of minor framerate drops everytime multiple enemies occupy the screen at one time
this is a minor problem but the framerate is still smooth enough to allow for fluid gameplaythe story is quite compelling and quite unique as well and does a great job of grabbing the players attention
the story takes place in the distant future where space travel and planet colonization is standard practice by humans
humans have colonized a planet known as reach and use this planet to genetically alter humans into cyborgs known as spartans
this practice has infuriated an alien race known as the covenant
the covenant has begun attacking the planet reach and destroying spartans and humans
one ship manages to escape with a spartan on board
the ship is known as the autumn pillar and the spartan is master chief petty office john better known as simply master chief
covenant begin boarding the autumn pillar and leave captain keyes with no choice but to release master chief and other marines in escape pods
before launching the pods master chief picks up the central control of the ship known as cortana and fuses her connection to his own cybernetic suit
the two crash land and must find and gather any humans who have survived
the two must then go on to rescue captain keyes who has been captured by the covenant and imprisoned on their ship
keyes issues a command to master chief to locate the control panel of the covenants main weapon halo
halo is a giant ringlike structure that contains massive energy and could cause serious extermination if activated
along the way to the control panel master chief discovers that the covenant have woken a dormant alien race known as the flood
now the fight between humanity includes a new enemy as the flood continue to spread rapidly
master chief is left facing some difficult decisions as the story progresses furtherthe gameplay consists of run and gun shooting that occurs at a fast pace
enemies are very intelligent on the higher difficulty levels and even the inclusion of an automatically regenerating shield is sometimes not enough to survive the enemy onslaught
the lands are very detailed but sometimes can become extremely repetitive
many of the levels consist of the same room design repeated over and over again making it feel like you arent really getting anywhere and are simply running in circles
some levels become tedious at times and the feeling of repetition begins to grow as the level progresses
this rule definitely applies to the later levels where it feels as if you are simply reentering the same two rooms over and over again in some sort of infinite loop each time the rooms contain the same enemies as well making the level feel even more repetitive
stages that arent so repetitive are quite compelling and fun to play in but these are limited to the first few stages as the game progresses the level designs lose their luster becoming mundane and boring
the graphics hold up quite nicely for a last gen game and the gameplay is smooth and addictive
the weapons the player picks up from the enemies are very effective and with enemies appearing by massive quantities its always easy to find another weapon to replace your current one upon running out of ammunitionanother complaint i have regarding the original halo combat evolved is in regards to the controls of the vehicles
some vehicles such as the ghost and banshee pilot beautifully giving the player amazing control over the vehicles
however the warthog can be unruly and almost impossible to control and navigate especially in tight corridors where obstacles are abundant
this is what makes the last level of the game almost impossible to beat since the warthog has such a hard time maneuvering properly without hitting obstacles
the steering of the warthog has greatly been corrected in the later games though but in combat evolved it is a vehicle i like to try to avoid drivingcoop is a great mode and adding multiple users really makes the game even more exciting especially on the higher difficulty levels
the ability of players to respawn their allies when not in combat allows you to continue the level without excess dying
had the levels been more unique and less repetitive i would have given this game a perfect score but with the repeating rooms and lengthy stages this games flaws are too drastic to go unnoticed
i enjoyed the game and i can definitely see why people love this franchise
the game is not as good as its sequels due to poor level design awkward warthog steering and fewer weapons but it truly innovated shooters on many levels and has quickly become one of my favorite franchises ever
if you want to follow the complete halo storyline then you should start with combat evolved but if you want to simply get the feel for halo for the first time i say skip combat evolved and start with halo unlike  of the other xbox users i did not buy my xbox for halo
infact when halo came out i didnt even like it
its true that this game has received way too much hype for what it really is
it is not true that this game is the best fps game ever made infact it doesnt even come closehalo is basicly quake iii red faction aliens vs pred  and halflife all rolled into one game
the big difference is that for the video gaming industry halo was the best thing people had ever seen before but for the pc gaming industry halo was just another space firstperson shooterif i were to rate this game on the basis of the pc it would only get  stars but from the xbox perspective its an ok
game
infact its pretty damn fun once you get into playing it in multiplayer mode
even single player mode deserves praise with a somewhat interactive environment
cooperative play is by far the most fun however if you only have  or  people playing the game
adversal multiplay doesnt really pick up until you have atleast  playersone thing that is a big plus but also a minus is that you get to drive vehicles such as vs tanks and a small handful of hover craft in this game
the bad part is that the driving physics for half the vehicles are questionable at the very least
the v is by far the worst handling of all and takes skill luck and patience to get the hang of
but if you have  human players in the v at the same time you feel like a teamthe graphics for this game are beautiful and the sounds are rich and clear
some of the missions are a little pointless and annoying but if you get past them its fun again
the controls are fairly easy to get the hang of once you play for awhile but the double control stick way of moving and looking around is a bit of a strugle to get the hang ofgame atmosphere and level design are both high scoring with all types of level formats and styles
the atmosphere runs higher when playing higher difficulties but its fun either waybottom line halo is still an over rated game but it is a fair bet and if you like fps games of the quakered faction era you should enjoy this game
i havent yet played halo on xbox live but simple multiplayer is quite fun if you have the controlers and the timethis is a very fun game that is revolutionary for the fps genre
i waited for this to come out for the pc for about a year the horror when i heard it was xbox only
but it was worth waiting forthe negatives are this game is way too easy not any difficulty setting
add the fact that you can play coop and with a sibling or friend you can truely fly through the game
its a fun ride though and the killerapp for the xbox
the controls could have been morethe graphics are stunning as well as the story
it is amazing deep and some parts it ventures off course with completely unbelievable tasks and missions it makes the game all the more enjoyablewhile i expected this to be a more realistic shooter and more difficult
it is worth buying and seeing the story truly take off the last two levelsthis game is the reason why so many of own an xbox
every person i know that has xbox at least has this game
ive played this game for hours and hours and i still never get bored of it
its that fun
the graphics are great all though they could have better vehicals and weapons but thats what halo  is for
this game doesnt even come close to timesplitters  but dont get me wrong that game is fun as well
the controls are also easy to get use to
if you dont have this game for xbox you shouldnt own one for shame
and another thing for some reason halo is never there at blockbustercoinsedince
i think nothalo raises the bar on fps solid game but its too short i rented it and beat it in  daysthe reason to own this game is for the multiplayer
i wish all fps woud use halos game design im sure halo  will raise the bar againlets hope
if you liked goldeneye   this game is a mustlet me explain my title
im am a huge fps fan
i own red faction  xiii tribes unreal tournament and alot more
those are all great games and anyone should try them out
but back to halo
lets start with the story
pretty basic you fight aliens with your team of humans which by the way you cant command in any way
the aliens are attacking you and you attack the aliens the aliens are some of the best ive seen since half life the grunts are so funny and the elites are so coolnow to the gameplay
its the normal first person shooter stuff
you run and gun nothing much more than any other gamei have to say the voicing is good
there are really no corny lines
it is some of the best ive ever seen toonow to master chiefs abilities
hes a super cyborg guy that can only hold  guns at a time
he cant jump very high and cant land large falls without hurting himself
but he can take alot of hits and keep on killingnow how about i go onto the so called best aspect of the game the multiplayer
the multiplayer is very defined
it is some of the best i have seen in a while
the levels are rich in design and character
the only real complaints i have on it are that there are no bots only  vehicle levels and not many levels
by the way hand em high is the best
finally to the thing that makes up every good fps the weapons
i have to admit this is one aspect i hope they fix in halo  yeah weve seen it all before pistol shotgun assault rifle rocket launcher im tired of the ordinary
bungie give us something new
or at least add  types of assault rifles and like  kinds of rocket launchers ect
but all in all halo is a great shoot em up and it has a fun mulitplayer and an average single player
oh by the way i forgot to mention the coop mode
it is fun and i like it but why only two player
hello microsoft the xbox has  control ports how about we use them all
but if you have an xbox you should by all means pick this title upfusion frenzy is best as a party game
you know when you got mulitple people and you want to play a game
the games take mili seconds to learn and almost impossible to perfect
which makes it better than most other party games where the person who owns it runs the table
the graphics arent world shakers but face it this game isnt about mind boggling graphics its about good beats making fun of the onein last place and generally getting mad at your friend until he passes the chipsthe game is funi especially like quottwisted systemquot
most of the games are fun but some of  them are too much alikethis game is extremely fun to play especially with friends
the variety of mini games is quite vast and the replay value of this game is terrific
all of my friends loved playing it
the graphics arent superb but its focus is on gameplay which makes up for the graphicssince i mastered this game and no one can beat me
i dont play this game anymore but it gave me years of entertainment
even my wife enjoyed it
i enjoy this game much better than mario party because the ai doesnt cheat like mpit is like an olympic style game in which you compete in  different games for orbs
after the  games are completed you take your orbs to the final event for that area in a game called fusion frenzy
before the fusion frenzy game starts you can either elect to play your orbs or trade some or all of them for points
the goal of ff is to put orbs in goals scattered along the ground
the only catch is you can only pick or orbs of your own color or the neutral white color
meaning if you are the red player samson no other player can pick up red orbs
you can also pick up and score with many orbs at one time for even more points
but watch out other players can attack and take your orbs at anytime for themselves
after completing all the areas the player with the most points is declared the winnerthere are  areas in this game all which have games that are relevant to that area
you can elect to play through all  areas or just  or   the six areas are coliseum downtown outlands military base power station and waterfront
the amount of orbs you get depend on how you place in each gamein total there are  minigames not including the fusion frenzy matches
while a couple of games are corny and outright boring most are pretty fun with a few of my favorites beingblast man standningjet streamroller ruckusrollmentumrubble alliancesumotank trackstwisted systemwater gate scramblethe graphics in this game are pretty basic but that doesnt bother me one bit
id take fun game play and ok graphics over superb graphics and terrible game play ie
pgr any daythe sound in this game is pretty basic but does seem to fit the game very well
you can also import your own tracks if you like but i think the music provided matches the game play sufficiently enoughmy only gripe about this game is that you are limited to playing against the people in your room
there is no xbox live support which definitely decreases the lasting appeal of this game greatly
after playing hundreds of times with the same people you will eventually get tired of the game even though the cpu does fill in the two unoccupied human slots with ai controlled players
xbox live would have increased the lasting appeal of this game infinitesimally because you will always have new people to play withi would like to see a sequel keeping the same concept but with possibly more characters and even more mini games
also even though i cancelled my subscription i would also like to see a sequel have xbox live supportthis game is a lot of fun with a big group of people
the games are easy to pick up but fun enough to play lots of times
there is also a good variety in the games from tron lightcycles type games to more dance dance revolution type games
the players are given plenty of opportunity to learn the controls of the game and to practice although some of them end up being a little difficult to figure outone drawback is that you end up having to do the quotfusion frenzyquot game after every third minigame
it can get a bit oldif you have a lot of friends who dont like video games let them play this a few times and they are hooked
it is extremely easy to catch on bc the controls are simple as can get and there are  games within this this discgreat game for groups of  players
i play this one with my kids age  and  a lot  and they play it with their friends
everytime we play we end up either laughing with each other or yelling at each other in a loving wayit actually is a collection of about  futuristic arena games  so it has a lot of replay value
there is no bad language or sexual innuendos and the violence is mild comical
so its okay for young childrensome of the magazines and users have given it negative reviews mostly because it doesnt fully use the xbox consoles graphical capabilitiesif you like to spend time with friendsfamily playing on your xbox then this is a great game for your collection
if you mostly play games alone andor only like games that leverage the xbox capabilities to the max then youll be disappointed with this onethis game is great if you have a few friends over but its a bit boring by yourself
it has great graphics and sound and you can also play your own soundtrack on it
most of the minigames are great but just a few are stupid and boring personally i think they put to many games on the same subject like sqaushing bugs or something
but overall its a great game and definitly worth your moneyif you have all four controllers and  other friends you should get this game
i just bought this game along with three extra controllers
my family and i were going nuts
i have played this game before with others and for the most part it doesnt get old
if you like to go head to head with other gamers and talk trash this is the game for you
there are over  different mini games to choose from
many of the games are really alike but it doesnt really matter because  are all fun
it is not for all tastes but once you get into it its nonstop
pretty soon you will be whooping and hollering with your buddies over simple little games
its a pretty funny sighti recently started playing games on the xbox and having this game to test out was certainly a nice surprise
i found the game to run without flaw and i was able to play the first time right out of the boxthe game has several games in it and the more players you have the more fun youll have
i found the competitiveness of each game to be both fun and exhilarating certainly a refreshing change from most games out there todaythe violence level is moderate although you may want to keep the really young player from playing
the graphics are outstanding almost to life like in some casesi think that is certainly one game that can and should be ported over the pc world
overall with the holidays coming up you would do well to get a copy of the game for just about everyone on the listwell i really enjoy playing this game
i recommend that you play it with more than just you
it is like a joust game where you have to beat the other players in about  different game settings
it is a blastall you need for a great party game there are  minigames you battle your experiencedornot opponents in
fast action and hard to put down
doesnt push the console to its true potential but doesnt need to its a a party gamefusion frenzy was one of the first games to come out on xbox and it is still a great game to have around
it is a collection of minigames based on individual or on occasion team competition
each minigame has a different objective and lasts on the order of a minute
you score points by having a strong finish in the minigames which ultimately may lead to an overall winfusion frenzy contains  minigames and although many of them are just different variations of a theme there is enough variety to give the game plenty of play value
levels include things like collecting orbs knocking pucks on ice human cage sumo matches smashing bugs jumping or ducking over obstacles etcthis game is great to bring out during parties or when company is over such as after the thanksgiving meal
while the game can only accommodate a maximum of four players i have played with as much as eight by rotating controllers
the minigames move along fast enough that no has a chance to get boardof course this game is not for everyone
if you are a hardcore gamer who spends more time with your xbox than sleeping and attending school combined or if you were thinking about purchasing this as a gift for said gamer this probable isnt the game for you
but if your video games are more for entertainment rather than a way of life of if you have a household of kids who want to have lighthearted fun fusion frenzy is a good betthis is a stunning game and one that i enjoyed immensely
graphics this good have not been seen on any system to date and there is quite a bit of technique and things to unlock
project gotham does not lack variety and youll be challenged to keep improving your times and abilities to move on or to unlock new things like new cars and helmets
the game takes advantage of the xbox internal clock so after x amount of hours played or miles driven you are rewarded with a new helmet or a new track
most cool
the only fault i can find with this game is that it truly requires an investment of the players time and patience
each car handles slightly differently and the ultimate trick is knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each cars powersliding ability which is a big part of the kudos scoring system
to fully unlock every level and to earn all golds it will require masterlevel skill and technique which many casual gamers do not possess and will quickly grow tired of failing or bored of the various stages
definitely not for someone prone to throwing controllers in frustrationif you want to get a sense of the xbox can do get this game
if you like your racing game to give you a variety of tasksstages and you enjoy chipping away at your games via unlocking and gradual learning project gotham is for you
if you are a casual gamer and not someone who enjoys the thought of replaying the same scene over and over again to get that elusive passing score then project gotham is not for you
get a straightforward racing game like nascar or x evolution  insteadi happen to like project gothamthe xbox has been on store shelves and in my living room for twoandahalf months
during that time i have played some of the best games ive seen in my long tenure as a video game guru including star wars obiwan halo and amped
being distracted by such wonderful examples of gaming genius like the ones above and about a half dozen others my wandering blockbuster eye always passed over project gotham racing
boy was that a mistakenow that ive had a good  days behind the wheel of pgr i can honestly say that it is my favorite car racing game to date
pgr combines the best aspects of gran turismo  ps with the pure fun of beatle adventure racing the underappreciated racing game for the nlike gt the graphics gameplay and physics are excellent
in fact graphically speaking pgr edges out gt due mainly to the attention to detail
the way the light reflects off of your shiny silver audi tt makes you drool as your highly polished windshield glistens in the sun
you watch as your driver yes there is actually a person in the car in pgr leans with the turns and takes his hand off the wheel to shift a nice touch if you ask megameplay is well thought out and highly customizable
there are six main racing options three of which ill talk about quick race arcade and kudos challenge
no the latter isnt sponsored by an early player in the energy bar market kudos is a point system
you earn kudos as bonuses for placing in certain races pulling off stylish moves or just generally kicking butt
in order to progress and earn new cars you have to race in each of the  modes
the quick race mode pits you against  other cars in a classic battle for rd nd or st
you progress through various cities and try to get at least a bronze to advance from say nyc to sanfran
the arcade mode is purely for kudos
yes you have to get very good at going through cones and pulling off cool slides and s to earn at least a bronze
the kudos challenge is my favorite mode
you work your way through an array of different races including the good ol me vs  other cars one on one overtake challenge pass x number of cars before time runs out speed challenge and several other creative and challenging ways of putting your driving skills to the testthe kudos point system is very customizable
by raising or lowering the difficulty level for each race you determine how many kudos will be awarded
the more difficulty the higher the reward and vice versa
getting that bronze medal is not necessarily dependent on whether you place rd but how many kudos you have earned
it may be a little confusing but just think of it as a great way to keep scoredespite the warning to the contrary driving in real life like you drive in pgr will in fact probably work for you because the physics and feel of the game is phenomenal
you almost feel a couple of gs as you blast around a corner doing  in a nissan skyline gtr
the controller only adds to the complete immersion in this game
not only does it vibrate in sync with whatever youre doing but the weight of the controller itself gives you the feel that youre controlling something with power
i dont know how this game would feel with a puny gamecube controller in my hand
you almost need the size to harness the power
speaking of the controller the default button and control layout leaves a little to be desired so i switched it up a little and made the trigger buttons be my up and down shift and a my gas
this works well enough except for the fact that my right thumb is red and shiny from constantly pushing on the a button
i know i know i could use the right analog stick for that but im just not that type of guyunlike gt this game is not so big that you get lost in it
there are not hundreds of cars with a plethora of confusing upgrades that youd have to be an auto mechanic or listen to an absurd amount of car talk to understand
its very straightforward win this circuitget new car
beautiful
new car faster now must go back to quick race and see if i can win that damn london race
see its completely manageable thus giving it that feel of beatle adventure racing
pure funlets not forget that pgr is soundtrack enabled which means you can listen to your own cds that youve put on your xbox
i cant tell you how nice it is to have my personal playlist of  songs
ohcool feature radio djs announce your music and break in on your songs with contest winners and request hotlinesi hope you get the feeling that this is a well thought out and highly polished game because it is
and all that thought has helped make project gotham racing the best combination possible both fun and challengingok for those of you out there that have been fortunate enough to either own or play several different systems or are hardcore enough to know whats hot or whats not you probably know that the biggest baddest racing game on the market is gt for ps which is the newest installment of the grand turismo series
while i wasnt as addicted to gt as some get ive got to admit that it deserves almost all of the hype its received
when buying project gotham there could be only one comparison one game to beat gtwhile far superior in some aspects i like to knock out complaints early my biggest complaint about gotham especially compared to gt is the lack of cars especially in the beginning
you only start with three cars none of which are ubercool or exciting
there should at least be more cars for multiplayer as its a drag to pull the game out of the box all hyped to play with friends and have to choose from a minicooper and a mr
with gt there was a huge selection of cars right out of the package for arcade or multiplayer games
i was so annoyed by this that im almost tempted to knock gotham down a star but the good things are so revolutionary that it survives wellsome people will be annoyed with the lack of a quotcampaignquot style game where you can buy and customize cars
i didnt find this too disheartening as thats really a gt thing and not something i expect with every racing game i buy
gotham is much more of an arcade style game than a simulator
its easy to overlook this oneok whats good about project gotham
everything else
if this is an example of things to come we can expect some incredible racing games for the xbox in the future
what pgr lacks in cars it makes up for in some of the most detailed circuits imaginable
the incredible ram and video ram capacity of the xbox means all the tracks consist of d models with d statues hurling by at an impressive framerate
buildings boast real signs and posters and landmarks down to the barest details
gts cardboard cut out people and environments sometimes bordered on cheesy
living in japan ive been to asakusa shibuya and shinjuku and theyve captured the landmarks and buildings perfectly
all that ram also allows pgr to do something that always bothered me about gt show damage to the cars
that was always irritating
winner pgrthe dolby digital sound is incredible
i only recently got the advanced av hookups and this game roars on my surround sound system
while it has an impressive song collection already on the disk pgr is the first xbox game ive owned that allows you to use your own music copied onto the harddrive
for another cool twist you can choose to listen to the radio presets which include authentic radio stations from the various cities including real djs
super cool
pgr has it all over gt in the sound categoryfun
this game is extremely fun and addictive
the game play is strong for any racer but the addition of a kudos system rewarding players for cool skids two wheels overtaking racers etc
adds a new dimension
while i thought it was cheesy at first the arcade game which allows you to run through a track solo strictly to collect kudos is a lot of fun
trying to do outrageous turns and combos becomes addictive
i dont think i can honestly say that pgr is more fun than gt but i can say its at least as funin the end while i really wanted to be able to declare one the undisputed victor over the other i really cant
pgr is far more sophisticated which is to be expected
gt has a depth and garage that pgr lacks
theyre both a lot of fun
if you can afford it theres only one true solution buy them both
if not im a big fan of better faster stronger so id have to go with project gotham
with new features and advancements not seen in other racing games project gotham has set a new standard that will certainly improve all games in the years to comeproject gotham racing is visually stunning
the vehicle detail is only matched by the exceptional detail given to the surroundings as you speed through ny sf london and tokyowhile i found the gameplay somewhat unique as unique as you can get while driving a car most people i have had over to my house to play it found gameplay rather difficult to get a handle onstill once mastered the game is rather fun to playalthough project gotham racing was an original launch title for xbox it doesnt disappoint
lots of gameplay modes and tracks divided over  cities san francisco new york tokyo and london as well as weather effects and car damage keep this games replay value and challenge factor high
the later stages and achieving golds start getting a bit overwhelming even for the veteran gamer but it still maintains a decent ai
where the game falls short on realism it gains an exceptional edge in arcadestyle s and jumps that not many racing games offer
sim games may be amazing in reality but lets all get back to our roots and remember the reason we started playing video games was arcade platformers and racers
a solid game with lots of great and useful my only complaint about gt dream cars you wont be disappointedi think that this game pgr is good because of the lap racing the graphics everything but most of all the tracks you can race in japan america london and i laso like that you have to earn the cars and tracks so that it isnt at all an easy cakewalk
the cool thing is when you docool things it adds up your kudos kudos are like money in the gamethis game has a nice feel
its one of those games that doesnt make you sick of it after you play for three hours
nice graphics and its fun to skid around the courses for style pointsbefore i begin i should note that i despise racing games and tend to have general dislike for games remotely in their genre
i would also like to note that pgr is not a racing game
though it has many instances where you do race the core gameplay centers on a combo system not unlike a fighting games that makes the game extremely addictive
it is not how fast you drive but how you drive fast
though the game can get very frustrating at times always making you strive for perfection pgr is a highly rewarding experience and gives you much to work for and look forward to
the cars albeit small in number are beautifully rendered and the overall presentation of the game is very well done
playing your own music is also a welcome option though you tend to not hear much of the songs because you are constantly restarting the level in order to reach the perfection that the game demands
like me you do not have to like cars or racing games at all to enjoy the splendor of pgr
you simply need perfectionproject gotham is like a highperformance sports car
it looks absolutely gorgeous dishing up thrills and giggles in generous portions
but be warned if you want this as your daily driver there are plenty of frustruations to live witheven though it was launched nearly two years ago the game still has some of the best graphics for an xbox driver out there topping newer releases like burnout  and midnight club  the only one that comes close is segas gt  but that title is hampered by repetitive tracks
project gotham has dozens of routes through four cities and youll never get bored of the scenerythere is a wide selection of cars ranging from sporty compacts like the mini cooper to muscle cars like the camaro and highend luxury sports cars from ferrari and porsche
there is no option to upgrade the cars though new ones are unlocked as you progress though the levelsthe gameplay is really tight and the cars behave more like a simulator than an arcade game
forget just gunning it all the way youll have to learn to apply the brake and watch the speedo going into corners
but there is a payoff for learning the ropes  the kudos system that awards points for tricks like slides and catching airhowever
there is a big drawback to project gotham and that is the difficulty
i admit im not great with driving games but certain races are nearly impossible without complete mastery of every trick in the book
this puts a good number of cars out of reach
i basically got stuck after unlocking a third to a half of the cars
because you need faster cars to compete better in the more difficult races if you get stuck on one or two races you will be out of luck as far as the single player mode goes
fortunately there is a widely known code that lets you unlock all the cars but that robs you of the feeling of accomplishment for doing it yourself
an adjustable difficulty setting could have solved thisall in all project gotham is a musthave driving title for the xbox and gets perfect scores for graphics cars and overall feel of the game
but the headpounding difficulty keeps it out of reach of the checkered flagso many people were desperate for project gotham racing to be the quotgran turismo killerquot  well it isnt the first to be saddled with that hope and wont be the last
my advice dont try to compare the two
both are successes in their own right and both are quality titles
but if i were forced i must give the edge to the pss gran turismo the best thing about project gotham is the variety
turismo has a marked tendency to get stale after awhile but both games require a lot from the gamer to get full enjoyment
this is not a game for those with short attention spans
its all about style in project gotham and after awhile you will be wishing you had some because chances are your best aint quite good enoughthere are relatively few quotlevelsquot in gotham but each is sectioned off into different portions depending on what the object of the race is
sometimes your objective is to finish first sometimes to finish a lap under a certain time other times it is to get above a certain kudos level
kudos are achieved by utilizing impressive driving techniques during your run like long power slides around corners overtaking other cars riding on  wheels turning s etc
the tough part is being able to show off enough style to rack up kudos while still finishing the race in a reasonable amount of timeand this game is not easy
you start out with relatively small unimpressive measly cars which can get you to the bronze level of the various challenges
from there the more challenges you complete the more cars you unlock
people have complained about the lack of quotcoolquot cars at the start but lets not forget that turismo limits your initial spending  to the range of mazda miata or plymouth pt cruiser
but it will take some time before you get around to unlocking the mean machinespersonally i like this game
anyone can smell a poorquality game coming a mile away this is not a poorquality game
it does demand a lot and i think that is where many will criticize it for not being userfriendly enough
and lets not forget that this is simply an updated version of bizarre creations old sega dreamcast game metropolis street racer
gotham is leaps amp bounds better than msr but some of the old gameplay gripes still existso dont judge msr on the turismo scale and have some patience with it
it is a rewarding experience eventually
its just a shame that many will trash it in frustration before reaching that pointproject gotham has endured the inevitable comparison to sonys gt franchise and in my opinion has fared rather well
as a gamer who has experienced both i would not rate either one higher than the other
each game has its own unique characteristics and features to provide adequate replay value
the licensing agreement with ferrari and porsche was a real coup for the gotham team but it is not enough to put it over the top when comparing it to the legend of gt
the kudos point system in gotham makes it a bit too arcadelike rather than a true sim
it is still a solid car game experience and i would recommend it to anyone with an xbox who enjoys gt or other similar sim gamesthis game is very easy to get into
its a totally different racing game
this may be the racing game for people who dont necessarily like racing games
there may not be too many cars to customize or too many locations but if you are just interested in the simulation then this game is everything you need
you dont just race to beat the clock or to win first
its more of a justhowwellcanyoudrivereallyfast game
but you know what
that is whats so cool about it
it feels like really driving at high speeds
even the controls are set up that way left top button to brake right top button for gas
in this game you get points for driving well
if you pass drivers up you get points
you make a hard turn perfectly you get points
you go through cones at blazing speeds you get points
imagine driving over  mph and trying not to crash
this is what the game feels like
for some it may be frustrating
it is easy to make points but it is also very easy to miss out on them
if you crash into something you lose those points
you can get point rich combos too
but if you accidently hit something like a wall or a cone you lose them on that turn yeah it sucks but it makes the game pretty exciting
youll find yourself shouting out loud and you will want to restart the race just to get those points
the graphics are cool the music is cool and the game play is cool
much like other racing games the more you race the more you unlock
if you dont give up easily youll find yourself playing this one for a very long time
the game is well worth its current cost but you may want to consider just buying the sequel
it looks about the same but has more goodies like online play way more cars and way more tracks
but for less than twenty bucks this game is greatno this is not a batman game as some people thought
its even better not that i liked batman gamesproject gotham easily has over  real cars like the f and viper models even has the new mini cooperthis game uses the soundtrack feature of the xbox which lets you play your own music from your cds during the gamein multiplayer mode you can race up to four people at once in over  different locationsand with excellent graphics this game deserves  stars if not better you decide that partfor the first time i entirely agree with the editorial reviewthis game is amazing but at the same time amazingly hardi have played racing games all the way back to ataris nightdriver and this game just blows my mindthe computer is a bit ruthless and never makes an erroreven with the poor handling cars
oh yeah the cars
wellthere are some really spiffy ones i doubt ill ever drive
tounlock most of them requires perfect scores on impossibletracks
the cover should just have a mini cooper on the frontbecause thats what you will be driving most in this gameif you feel yourself ready to throw the controller against thewall just remind yourself it isnt real
or is itas stated in the title i bought it to complete the series of the games
for its age its not a bad game at all
it shows damage on the cars just like the modern ones just a bit more pixelated but overall its a pretty cool game to playchad steingraberparadigminfogrameslevel designergame designerd artist on the terminator dawn of fatethe game is odd but then it is called quotoddworldquot after allso dont be shocked when you find yourself saying quotthats oddquot
but the real question should be quotis it funquot
that completely depends on your perspectivedo you like slower paced games where you run around and collect things to solve puzzles
jumping around to hit the next piece of the ladder
telling little baby looking things to attack your enemies
then this is the game for you
i personally enjoyed playing it but i couldnt play it for a long amounts of timeid get a little boredbut thats meone thing that did bug me was some of the music after a few hours i couldnt stand listening to iti had to turn the volume down just so i could keep playing
younger kids will love this game adults might shy awayi liked this game so much
not loved but liked liked enough to keep on playing it
the guys are such a blast to play especially munch
he may not have much going for him but i love the radar zapper he has
drink a can of zapp and hes leathal
great fun
and it improves your communication skills
quothey
its abequotthe original oddworld game abes oddysee was pretty challenging
i never got around to playing abes exxodus
it was definitely a thinking mans game
it appeared to be a platformer but in truth it was a puzzle game through and through
the controls and character animations were not geared towards true platforming action
it was about figuring out what precise series of steps you had to take to reach areas and how to guidehelpmanipulate npc characters to reach areas
for the most part munchs oddysee is the same sort of game
arbitrary edit by one of amazons faceless editors
i never encountered any puzzle that was as tough to crack as the toughest puzzles in abes oddysee
i dont object to the few levels in which you send a squad of allies to attack enemies
when you spend so much time in the game sneaking around and fearing for your life turning the tables on the bad guys once in a while feels great
one thing that hurts the challenge level is that you can literally save anywhere
anywhere
in the original if you had to run a long gaunlet of several tough manuvers you just had to keep trying over and over until you were able to perform them all in one go
in this game if youre faced with a series of  demanding jumps you can make the first jump save make the second jump save etc
if you miss the final jump rather than have to start back at the beginning you can just reload your last quicksave and try that final jump until you get itive always been a big fan of the oddworld series ever since abe underwent his first oddysee back in the glory days of the psone
i think the real hook for me with that first game was realizing there was a button entirely dedicated to forcing your onscreen character to fart
id never seen anything like it before and its one of the major reasons i went ahead and bought my first playstation along with oddworld episode i as my first game
it had inspired gameplay an offbeat sense of humor that hit all the right notes great voice acting and incredible replay valuefortunately enough many of those qualities have remained intact beyond abes second game and now into oddworlds third chapter
my one major qualm about abes exoddus the second game the change in voice actors for abe himself has now been repaired
with the old feel back again a new character a stunning jump to d and a continuation of the old story there should be nothing holding this game back from perfection right
well not entirely sodespite everything its got going for it there are a few little factors about this game which serve to do nothing more than irritate
nearly every operation required of your character is performed with one button
the xbox controllers a button is used to jump press buttons pick things up pull switches activate portals climb into a wheelchair operate machinery or grab a drink from one of the games vending machines
the rest of the controllers buttons are used for conversing with nonplayable characters a task which was completed by holding in one of the l or r buttons and pressing another button in earlier games in the series
as a result youll often jump to your doom when youd rather lift something up or something equally as silly
in addition controlling abe in the open field is notably difficult
there are points where precision is an absolute necessity but abes veering left when you want him to go forward
for a game of this magnitude with a control system that was already tweaked to perfection its silly that they muddled things like that
youll eventually get used to the inadequacies of the system but will never get to the point where abe or munch does exactly what you want every single timeanother thing that slightly irked me was the length of the game
though its certainly nothing to sneeze at i completed everything in around eight hours
maybe nostalgia has fogged my mind but i dont remember the first two games as being that short
but as i said its a minor issue and not one ill really take anything away for
just dont go into this expecting an epic on par with final fantasy or grand theft autothe way this game looks is simply amazing
as a firstwave launch title for the box ill admit i had set my expectations a little loftily but munchs oddysee surpassed even my steep hopes and wishes
every step of this world is visually stunning from the soft gradient of the outdoor skies to the brown crusty grime gathered around the toilets in the later stages
the attention to detail is off the charts and id occasionally just set the controller down and take everything in
its that good lookingin addition the prerendered cgis maintain the standard set forth by the previous episodes
the cinemas were always one of my favorite parts of oddworld and the envelope continued its trend of moving forward here
just great great stuff brought full circle with some spoton voice workthe audio tells you everything you need to know when first gaining your surroundings in a new area
with dolby support its possible to locate a lost mudokan with your eyes shut
you can hear the clickclickclick of an enemy slig down the hallway
the music is fresh maintaining a beat in the background but never overpowering the scene
it picks up when youre being assaulted or chased and dips back down when youre just patiently exploring
the cartoony sound effects are occasionally out of place and unnecessary but on the whole dont interfere
my one problem with the audio was more a planning issue than anything else
every once in a while youll run into a spiritual advisor who tells you what you need to be doing in that part of the stage
its pretty important you understand what hes saying yet subtitles arent available in case someone you cant hear him for some reason
a vacuum cleaner was running elsewhere in the house one afternoon and i had to wait for some time before i could continue because i needed to know what he was telling me
subs shouldve at least been an alternative optionthe story is pure oddworld
it kept me intrigued every step of the way even if what i was doing was repetitive
theres an overlying theme of lightheartedness and the same issues of extinction and over industrialization are covered in a new and interesting way
with rumors claiming there are three alternate endings depending on how many innocents you save through the game theres also the promise of enjoyable replay value without identical resultsall in all the series has made a successful albeit rocky jump into the world of d the graphics are very impressive even by todays unrealistic standards the audio isnt flawless though its close the controls need some work and the story has never been better
this is a really fun game to play and though it does get a little easy theres always just enough challenge to keep veteran players occupied without losing interest
its a great way to kick off your xbox collection whether youre young or old new to gaming or hardened from years of battlei received this game for xmas i probably wouldnt have bought in on my own
the game is a lot of fun as it is very different from any other game ive played
the graphics are great and the overall gameplay is very good
if you are tired of the sports games and the typical fighting games try this one outgreat characters sound is great graphics are good control is good game speak is great
this just a test run right
it better be because the xbox is capable of so much more and then some
odd world is a good adventure but it really needs more variety
this the xbox people not gamecube n ps or gameboy advance
use that mhz cpu gpug hard drive  sound channel
rip all that apart and blow us away or some one will be out of a jobthis game is really wierd
but it is fun in the end
i think most people will like it
if you like shrek this ones for you
if you like whacked you will probably like this
if you dont like both of them you may not like this and i suggest you rent itthis is a game for all the family
you get to control  characters quotabequot quotmunchquot
abe is best on land by running fast jumping high mind controling enemies telling friends to help him out and more
munch is small and he can swim use a wheel chair to move faster rescue small fury creatures and more
if you like crash bandicooti thought crash  was best followed by crash then youll like thisprosthe pricenot violentquite originalmake kids laughgreat graphicsinfinity healthno time limit to finish missions of game not hardmy friend with learning dicabilities could play thissave anyweregood cutcenesyou can skip themquite repetetivetakes  days or more to finishsometimes you dont know what to do nexti didnt play the game for months then i got back to it and completed itoddworld first one and a half games were hilarous and innoventivebecause the sequel to oddworldabes oddysee dosent count
the  game in the series has to be the second best of them all because even though this game tops the first one in every way possible but the sad sad truth is its the shortest of them all
munch and abe are like made for each other even though they were made that way
the controls are good but the xbox controller feels like its from a different world because switching is very awkward at very important parts of the game which thus losing a star from me
if you love comedy games like earthworm jim and earthworm jim  this game is made espically for youwhen i first started playing this game i thought oh no i just wasted fifty bucks
but then after i played a while i realized that this isnt just another formula crash bandicoot game
it has a creative plot and interesting characters to interact with
also you switch between the two heroes munch and abe so you dont get tired of them
very nice graphics but a little dark
overall a creatively conceived game all around that makes you want to keep playingthis game and its characters have got so much personality it spills over right into your lap
darn and these were brand new pantsthis game is wicked cool visually it has good sound and an excellent storylineso far a bit on the easy side but if i recall the other oddworld games that wont lastplatformrun amp jump amp shoot type games arent really my style but this combines that genre with a significant amount of problemsolving and interaction with other lifeforms within the gamewhat this game has which is something i prize in books as well as gamesis uniqueness
now i know that sounds like an odd thing to say about a game that is third in a series but the addition of munch and the fact that the game is completely ind make this a truly singular experience
most games of this type are mindless repetition and no story but this series is almost closer to a pixar film than a video game
go get itodd world munchs oddesy is a very underrated xbox title that is being ignored by halo loving fools
this game is the sequal to the ever so loving odd world series for the playstation
this time the story revolves more around munch
this poor lil dude is caught up on the wrong moment at the wrong time
soon our hero is caught up with our previous odd world hero abe
these two guys really make a great duo
they are the ratchet and clank jak and daxter of the xbox
the game is superb with storyline and gameplyoddworld has extreamly awesome gameplay and its a game that i acctually wanted to beat so i can see what happends to poor abe and munch
the game is sort of repetitive but is overall fun filled action adventure
the game is chuck full of really memorable levels and battles with enemies
once again abe is able to possess the baddies and take controll of them
poor munchmost of the time youll have to have em in a weelchair since he only has one foot
the game is a really great game but it fails at lengh and some gameplay elementsthe music is great visuals are awesome but the game can end pretty quickly and is pretty repetitive
there are more then  ending that will keep you playing for awhile but you could easily beat it withen a week
that really doesnt help this underrated classic but ohwellgoodvisuals are fantastic and one of the best on the xboxgreat gameplay elementssome really memorable gameplay sequencesmunch and abe are able to posses thingssome endings to get which will last for awhilebada bit on the short sidecan be repetitivesome parts look exactly like the same levels except new enemiesthe uglymunch in a weelchairewwwwoverall munchs oddesy is an underrated xbox title that no xbox owner should miss out onunless there expecting something like halo then forget itthe visuals are great fantastic voice acting great gameply you can controll the camera which is great but still doesnt help for the repetitive gameplay and some dull levels and overall is a very enjoyable game and that is why im giving it a out of  starslatesa very weird but entertaining plot munchs oddysee starts off with explaining each characters munch and abe story
its up to you the gamer to save oddworld from the evil vykkers greedy bigwigs and the glukkons
you will be playing the game as munch and abe always switching back and forth between levels or in the same level
you will be saving from fuzzles about to fry to muddokins about to die
sound odd so far
munchs oddysee has to be the perfect puzzle game for pretty much anyone w a crazy and funny sense of humor
even parents can get hooked on this great puzzler
with great eye candy and great visuals of camera angles this game did not hold back on graphics and creativity
through the levels you will need to work through some puzzles to move through to later stages
most of the time munch and abe will need to work as a team
although there are some levels that include fighting and violence its pure fun and excitement rather than blood and gore
making it very suitable for young ages
you will also need to save many furry little creatures called fuzzles and abes friends called muddokins
who are pretty brain dead and really needs abes guidance

with great graphics puzzles and characters this game is great for all ages
you may want to rent this game before buying just to make sure this is the game that you can get into
i hope this review helped you in deciding if this games for you
sean barnettmunchs oddysee is the first game in the oddysee franchise that i have played
the first two games in the series were released on playstation formats but munchs oddysee came out on xbox and was one of the launch games of that system
i first played this game at a friends house not long after it came out
i was fascinated by the amazing graphics and having different characters in the world literally follow the main characters around
it wasnt until recently however that i was able to get the game myself and play it all the way throughmunchs oddysee is the third game in the oddworld series
if youre like me and have never played any of the other games in the series thats okay because theres a movie at the beginning of the game that explains abes adventures in the first two games and the connection between abes race the mudokons and gabes race the gabbits
munch is the last living gabbit but is captured by the evil vykkers a race of creatures bent on domination consumerism industrialism and environmental destruction
munch is taken captive and one of the early levels of munchs oddysee involves helping munch escape from the vykkers labs ship
once abe and munch meet up the general storyline of the game involves getting back to the vykkers labs ship to rescue the egg crates full of mudokon young and save the last can of gabbit eggs in existencethe graphics in the game are amazing
it feels and looks like you are playing a movie
this shouldnt come as a surprise because the oddworld series was originally conceived as a set of films
however the company oddworld inhabitants started making video games instead
oddworld inhabitants has gone back to their original plans and the first oddworld movie is apparently in productionas for game play munchs oddysee is simple enough that even most beginning gamers can play along fairly easily yet the game has enough challenges to make it interesting enough for lifelong gamers
the game is fun to play and appeals to children and young adults but has enough humor and oddity to appeal that it appeals to older gamers too
now that ive experienced oddworld im looking forward to the cinematic tales oddworld inhabitants will bringthis is a great game for xboxit might make people want xbox instead of ps or gamecubei played the first oddworld for playstationi loved it i think this is a great game but i wish it was coming for psmy systemi bought this game thinking it would be something like zeldahah
this is like the very basic zelda where you can walk around and use  attack
there is no items menu or weapons menu or any menu besides the pause
this game is sooooo repetative nothing different alllllll the same
hah and hear this
i went to the store a few weeks after i got azirik at the same store
i bought another game blinx which i dont highly reccomend either but its not nearly as bad as this one and when i was buying it the salesman said quotand if for any reason you should not like this gameyou can take it back within  daysquot and i said quoto i wish i knew about that when i bought azurikquot and he sais quotwell technically we shouldnt have even sold you azurikquot
hahaha this game is so badthis is one of those games that even with cheats it is still challenging
the concept of combining elements was cool and different
on this game you have to do a lot of backtracking through the different realms but that makes it even betterthis is a good game
has nice graphics average soundbutawesome gameplay
this is one of the funnest games ive played and if not for the average graphics and sounds it would have got a star rating
it may take a while to get into but finding new places getting new powers unlocking secrets and fighting kicka bossess make it a fair competiter
i believe people dont put enough time into this game
like i said it takes a while but this ends up into a nice box
the story line begins at a tower where the  
realms meet
there are  lore gaurdains left azurik and cant remember namedammit
the lore gaurdian that isnt azurik is possed by the death realm leader and is driven to take the death realm disk and destroy the others
this is a very long game so expect long game time
i think it takes around  hours to beat
wow
i still havt won but im closeone of the flagship titles for xbox and one of the reasons i was so looking forward to xbox to begin witha great looking football game without having to learn all those massive key combinations like madden which can suck the fun out of a game if youre so busy trying to figure out buttonsill leave the pros quite simple since many of the reviews you will read are all positive and i concur for the most part game graphics are absolutely stunning it is relatively easy to learnyou can pretty much master the controls   minutes out of the box and the included tutorial is great tons of plays to chose from some would even say too manyi know i cant possibly go through all the plays within  seconds per down the stadiums are great as well as weather and lighting effects
all the teams are present plus many to unlock and special teams accurate stats on all current players and extensive create playerroster functions highlight real and commentary add more realism great save feature practice feature energetic soundtrack force feedback on controlsthe not so bad cons the manage teams you play the role of manager function is a bit overwhelming for the casual fan
you can literally spend hours building teams from scratch trading players working with salary caps etc
this is micromanagement at its most and really detracts from the game unless you like that sort of control dynasty mode
you play a team for  years and try to make your mark in history
fun but the quarters are limited to  minutes thus really making it hard to make a game without huge plays a big gamble no season mode
why cant i just pick a team and play one season up to superbowl
this is probably my biggest contention with the game for novice players the whole   dime and shotgun plays need better description
with so many plays to choose from its hard to decide on the best strategy with little description
most of the time you will just end up picking the recommended play that the cpu choosesall in all this is a great and fun game to sit down with a buddy and play a regulation game with
i know my friends and i are sitting on the edge of the seats when we play and really get excited with great execution of plays
but the long dynasty and lack of one season modes make this game fall short of  starsthis is one of the best nfl football games ive ever played i think id like blitz just a little bit better but it is great
very good graphics and also has bonus teams bonus levels quottraining campquot and a few different type of real and quotfantasyquot seasons
once you get stared and good at it you will haveget nfl feverthis was the decision i was faced with after getting my xbox
i knew i wanted one football game but i had no clue which one to get
after doing some major research about all three games this is my condensed concise summary of which one you should getunfortunately info and reviews on nfl k were quite limited since it doesnt come out until late january
however k amp  were pretty popular on other consoles and k will definitely have its fanbase
k for the xbox definitely parallels microsofts nfl fever
both of these games are very arcadebased whereas madden is simulationbased
for example fever and k would be more concerned with how quickresponding a player is whereas madden may take longer because it is calculating accurate movements based around player attributes
your halfback who weighs thirty pounds more than your fullback is going to run much slower than your fullback in a simulationbased game than an arcadebased game and you may get frustrated when your tightend cant reach that pass in time
however on the flipside your best players will probably rack up unrealistic stats in an arcadebased game
do you care that your cornerback may get five interceptions in one gamei love sports stats and would find madden much more realistic
however there is definitely something to be said when you can mention nfl fever in the same sentence as madden this is only the first year of nfl fever
how will nfl fever stand up against nfl k if it is an arcade style football game that you want
all three games are very good at the quottypequot of game they offer
but the decision really comes back to you as a gamer
which do you wanteveryone wants to know quothow does nfl fever  compare to madden quot  the answer is that fever compares favorably but is ultimately a different sort of football game
if you always thought madden was quottoo arcadeyquot then you might want to steer clear of this one as it plants itself somewhere between the simulation efforts of madden and segas nfl k and the kamikaze kinetics of the nfl blitz series
fever is actually a very compelling and fun game once you get over the fact that you arent playing maddenfever easily pulls off the best graphics ever in a console football game
from the integration of many different intro shots for each play to the exacting detail which accompanies every hit jump and stiffarm it is fantastically clear that the developers went the extra mile to really draw you in to the game and create an exciting amp colorful world
the players jabber at one another celebrate successful offensive achievements and showboat after a steller defensive effort
it really does make madden look fairly pale and colorless as a resultthe commentary suffers from some uneven choppiness quotfive yard reception by engramquot but does give some timely insight in certain situations quotthe defense is in a  a run would be successful herequot  the muchtouted graphics are indeed a stepup from madden but are not letterperfect
the detailed faces are a very nice addition but disappoint when jerome bettis looks nothing like jerome bettis
hes detailed but looks nothing like the real guy
but it sure beats maddens cheesy kewpiedoll facesthe bottomline really comes down to gameplay and fever tends toward quotthe big playquot  interceptions are more common than in madden big runs big returns long gains freighttrain tackles all of it brings make fever seem a little overthetop and really makes madden seem slow amp pensive in comparison
which is why some wont take to this more reactive arcade style of gameplay
traditional football playcalling amp tactics still apply but the realism factor is purposefully loosened to create a more noholdsbarred atmosphere designed to ramp up the funfactorhonestly it took me a few times before i was ready to accept this type of football not to mention getting used to the xbox controller but once i did i really started to appreciate the flair and style that fever brings
i guess the telling thing is that i tried to go back to madden and really had to mentally shift gears to prepare for a different sort of football experience
nfl fever  is fun easy to pick up and play easy to like great player fun and a lot deeper than your average console football game
and they did an admirable job of injecting some life into a stale genre by pushing the funfactor way up while still retaining the confines of real footballif too many years of madden is gradually putting you to sleep get into the fever and see how much fun a football game can bea little too easy a little too soon
i did exceptionally well on higher levels and if you are somewhat good at madden  you will be great at fevergraphics are jaw dropping and im not really regretfully that i bought fever  but i like the challenges and gameplay that madden offersim back again with a game review on nfl madden  everyone that loves sports games has heard of madden
if you havent then listen up
madden has become worse and worse over the year until now
xboxs nfl madden  has all of the requirements of an xbox game
you can still go in franchise mode season and exibition
and this one has the game famous madden cards with a whole new style
and finally the game has the feature createateam
they also have the expansion team houston texans
in franchise mode you can have an expansion draft as an offseason activity for your team or the houston texans
so check it out
rated e for everyonepretty sweet game
nfl fever is a little better but this ones fun too
the controls are ok i guess
the graphics are mindhealing
i love them
they are like looking at a hott girl in a bikini and then getting to be able to touch her
nd best sports game for the greatest box in the world
th on my mind for best gameif you want to get in depth with a game this is it
great simulation you wont be able to immediatley join a game and have a chance at beating someone who has played a while itll be no competitionmadden  is a very good football game that falls just a little short of five stars
i like the game an awful lot and have played a great deal over  games  minute quarters of course so far and will play a lot more but there are some flaws
in no particular orderthe graphics in madden are really nothing special
they arent terrible and the player animations during the game are nice but the backdrops are dull and all too often you see players walk right through each other in the after play animationsnot nearly enough work was put into the experience of playing defense
madden has a very nice training mode for offensive plays which really carefully explains everything from blocking assignments to reading pass coverage
there is also a sometimes nifty quotask maddenquot feature in offensive playcalling in which the game will reccomend offensive plays when prompted and even provide some reasoning for the choice but there is no such feature for defense
you are pretty much on your own when it comes to calling plays on defense beyond the vague reccomendation in the easy play mode that you run  against the run and nickel or dime against the pass
but that doesnt help explain the subtle differences between and  quotthunderquot and a  quotlightningquot
which is better against short yardage running plays
which is better against play action or screens
you can get some ideas from looking at the small diagram of the play but on the whole there is a lot lacking in defensive play callingit is far too easy to run the football
running blindly wont work but if you pay attention to the way the play is diagramed and follow your blocks it isnt hard to rush for  yards on  to  carries in every game against the hardest difficulty setting all madden with all the defensive ai settings cranked up as high as they go
in contrast it is far too hard to pass the ball
you really must read the defense and go through progressions just throwing to your primary reciever or throwing to the same reciever over and over will not work and thats quite fun but recievers will drop balls way way too often no matter how softly or how hard you throw the ball
and if your reciever does not have the coverage beat by at least two steps the pass will be tipped or intercepted about half the time as defensive backs controlled by the computer seem to be blessed with superhuman closing speedanother minor annoyance is the announcing
madden and summerall are clear and conversational but a lot of their comments are very out of place
for example five minutes into the first quarter you get the ball for the first time down a field goal and you run the ball for your first play
summerall will announce shocked quotthese guys still think they have time to establish the runquot  and madden the sage will respond quotwhen youre down like this its time to put your faith in your quarterbackquot  um yeahfinally it is very hard to play fair realistic football
the first three difficulty levels are so easy once you get the basic controls down that it is no trouble at all to win by anywhere from five to ten touchdownsand thats no fun
the only level that can challenge you at all is all madden and it does that by openly cheating
the opposing defensive line will slice through your pass protection like a battle axe through butter without ever having to blitz their receivers never drop balls and indeed their defensive line has better hands than your best receiver the computers pass protection is near perfect unless you blitz with two extra men
you will be penalized two or three times as often as the other team and after about half of your big plays
i think this could be fixed up some by forcing the computer to play fair instead of cheating in the most blatant of ways but then also teaching it how to play against the run a little better so you cant just run them over every gamedespite what it may sound like so far in the review i really do think madden  is a fantastic game
i really like the momentum based physics system and the game does a better job than any other of capturing the feel of real football with the exception of the poor ai run defense
the game comes with a ton of options in all its formats
in its franchise mode you can create players draft players sign free agents trade progress players from poorly rated rookies to top notch stars over a few seasons etc
in season mode you can even edit the attribues of existing players something i found necessary to make some of the players better match their real life counterparts mike vick running slower than most fullbacks was just wrong for example
this is actually a really neat option as it allows you to play the game youre in the mood for
if you want a real high scorer go in an jack up both teams offenses
if you want a real low scorer go in and pump up the defenses etc
there is a robust practice modes although you cant practice with created or edited teams which is annoying
there is also a nice situation mode and a minigame the  minute drill go in with any team against any team and see how many points you can score in  minutes
another nice feature are the madden cards
you can earn challenge points for scoring in the  minute drill or for completing quotchallengesquot in a regular game ie
throw for  yds etc
and use these points to buy packs of cheat cards that open up hidden teams and stadiums boost current players and bring old ones out of retirement or change other game conditionsin summary if you like football games go ahead and get this one
youll have a lot of fun with it especially against friends but dont expect perfection
i hope i havent turned anyone off of the game with some of my rants but i also hope someone from ea sports reads this and makes the appropriate adjustmentsmadden  is a solid football game but theres no hiding from the fact that it wasnt specifically built to take advantage of the xboxs capabilities
because of this i cant shake the feeling that this game isnt all that it couldve been
the improvements in graphics are definitely noticable but not on par with what we expect from the xboxbut the  dollar question is which game is the best out of nfl k madden  and nfl fever  fever and nfl k are in more direct competition with each other than with madden  theres an obvious arcadeleaning gameplay mechanic in fever and k that madden just does not have
the ea game requires a play style thats been refined learned and accepted over the years that can be pretty unforgiving to the uninitiated but that is its charm
when i look at madden objectively which we try to do here it plays a lot slower than either of the other two games but i also see that its intentional
madden  isnt going to wow you with its speed even if youre running the ball with edgerrin james because youre supposed to be awed by its authentic blocking and defensive aiits nfl substance over style that weve come to expect from madden games and thats what madden nfl  gives usthis is my first football video game and so far im very pleased
i went with madden due to to eas reputation for quality in sporting games
the graphics are very good and the game play is very good as well
the commentary though has something to be desired
im a fan of madden on tv but the commentary on  puts you to sleep
the commentary often repeats itself and the tone of voice is dull
other than that i would recommend the game to any football video game fani play them both i feel madden has better griphic but the game play is not as good i felt i could do less in madden than k for dreamcast madden make me feel that you can not change you type of play or i under stoud k faster than maden all though i only payed two players on maden i see people complaining about how the game looks that is looks just like the ps
i own  system so the ps does not even come into play with how i look at this gamedepth replay and sim like
this is for gamers that like sim sports games not gamers that are looking for a arcade game
the  draw backs that i see with this game are madden and summerall  are old and out dated  have you listen to them do a real game they have gotten really bad just think about how they are in game then  the voice overs are boring and like with most games get old real quickminor draw in problems only on replays  plays walk through other players
no snow 
when was the last time a season went by and there was no snow in at least one game first off let may start off with these words madden is a challenging yet fun game
addictive after getting into a good franchise there are so many good things about it itll keep you entertained forever
however there were a few flawsthe graphics first off are excllent
a clean helmet reflects a beautiful shine a dirty helmet well the tackles look extremely realistic as sometimes youll get pulled down by the leg and sometimes youll get creamed and knocked back a few yards
the sounds of each tackle are awsome and realistic and sometimes when your on defense itll take  or  people to knock a good running back downwhich is quite true in the nfl
the uniforms look very sharp with shadows dirty uniforms and overall smooth figuresthe stadiums look great and its always cool to hear the game attendance
yes they annouce the game attendance like say 
it changes from time to time and big games will get big draw outs small games will get small drawouts
incredibly realisticthe gameplay is decent but not great
its always challenging and something about it makes it too challenging
in past madden games its been too easy to go to the super bowl every year even on the hardest settings
in this game its way to hard on even all pro easy pro all pro madden pro
first off on gameplay if the opposing receiver or running back breaks free hes gone
there is no way too catch up with a receiver even with the tiniest lead
no spead gainer no sprint button
and on offense the cpu defenders seem to be blessed with superhuman speed catching up with a person even with a  yard cushion
your receivers always drop passes even someone like isaac bruce and is nearly impossible for the player to get a sack
all this on the all pro i wonder what its like on madden but if your like me and have been waiting for a challenge in a madden game this will definantly give you a challengeoptions in this game our incredible there are so many things to do
franchise where u start a franchise optional fantasy draft
create a coach salary cap create a team with uniforms logos stadiums everything
its from scratch u start from create a team and the uniforms u can design
season practice training madden cards exibition etc you can create a whole new team from the uniforms logo name yes the people can pronouce the name just like u me like say dallas sharks stadium name capacity of the stadiuma million if u want the type of stadium bowl dome
u can put this team into a season franchise  seasons or even exibition
u can have a fantasy draft salary cap even be the coach of your team
there are so many things to do
youll never get bored of options in this game neverfinally the overall depth
its fun
the commentary unfortunantly hasnt changed since the  version but its still decent the player ratings are pretty good the whole thing plays pretty well
theres a typical person in seat b you have won a lifetime supply of hot dogs from the comentor and the players actually react to what happens
they even shake hands and high five at the end of a victory
the coaches get angry on a bad play clench their fist in satisfaction on a well devised score
u can really c that ea put a lot of thought into madden overall this is an excellent game but if your not up to a huge challenge i wouldnt buy it go for blitz
but if you want a realistic game thats fun has many options great graphics and brings the atmosphere of the nfl into your house
this is the game for youi think to really enjoy this game you need to be into nascar
i rented this game and found it kind of boreing but im not a nascar fan
as a game itself they did a nice job with the graphics and overall game play
i would rather play a formula  type game with more turnsbut be warned this is not a simulation game
if you are looking for an authentic racing simulation look elsewhere
if however you are looking for a great arcade game that is years ahead of the great daytona usa games then this is the one for youit is unfortunate however that their are few hidden extras in the game
while you do get access to many new and exciting cars and car desings the reality is that you are not going to use them because you will have you own car designedthe career mode is long and deep though it gets monotinous after a few seasons
there are alot of tracks but they are much easier to master since well their mostly all ovalsthe bottom line is if youre looking for a solid arcade racing game then choose this one if youre looking for a racing sim game pass on it and await one that is betterever since the first game was featured as part of a pizza hut  playstation demo disc in early  ive been completely and utterly in love with the tony hawks pro skater line
its always been such a perfect formula a flawless mixture of physical sport and mental planning
its one of those few genres that manages to ascend from a lighthearted distraction to a legitimate undeniable skill
youll never see the same twominute run twice in a game of tony hawk there are just so many possibilities so many tiny nuances to alter and  or improve uponright out of the gates the first thing that strikes you in x is the tremendous leap forward the graphics have taken since the last time you saw the game in motion
as a diehard dreamcast enthusiast who played through the original tony hawk  on that platform instead of the standard psone i wasnt expecting to be as blown away by the visuals as i was
this looks every bit like a game that was originally planned designed and formatted for the xbox
walls and ramps no longer look like polygons with simple textures wrapped around them
the colors and contours of that familiar wooden ramp look so good you can almost smell the splintering boards themselvesyoure pressed for time every second you spend immersed in the world of tony hawk x
as the level loads considerably faster on the box than on its older rival youre given a laundry list of tasks to complete
once youve finished browsing the checklist itself the player is asked to press of the quotaquot button and the infamous twominute timer begins to tick your life away
within your first several plays the clock seems like a ferocious enemy something youll never be able to conquer
its relentless a brutal learning curve that forces you to improve upon yourself or fail in an ugly mess
the skaters take an eternity to regain their footing after a long fall and several of the level goals especially the pro and sick scores seem unreachable
but as you play deeper and deeper into x the clock slowly and surely reveals the truth it was on your side all alongas a big fan of the playstations controller i did have a small bit of difficulty adapting to the xboxs larger less dpad centered controller
each skater comes equipped with eight grab eight grind and eight kick tricks one for each direction including diagonals and the player cannot afford the luxury of pressing up on an analog stick and watching their onscreen character perform the trick assigned to upright
so i moved my left thumb down a couple inches to the boxs underdeveloped cylindrical dpad
where the sonys pad contains four distinct directions the boxs various controllers feature a standard dpad sculpted in the middle of a big circle
while this may ease diagonal movement in other games its less than ideal for the kind of detailed precise directional pressing i need here
the a b x and y buttons too are more difficult to reach than the ps controller making a quick pressing of the grind button more difficult than youd expectif you can move past the troubles with the xbox controller the gameplay is every bit as much fun as you might remember from the first release with the exception of a few common highly annoying bugs
most glaring is the change in camera sensitivity
one thing i remember well about this game at the time of its first release was the tight responsive camera that followed your movements like a hawk no pun intended
this is not the case in thpsx
the view lags well behind your skater as he turns jumps and performs tricks
more often than not youll be looking at your skaters chest and the scenery shooting by from right to left behind his back instead of his side and the oncoming territory in front of you
if i didnt already know the levels like the back of my hand id have been incredibly annoyed with the number of times this happened so i can only imagine what it must be like for someone playing the title for the very first timei was a bit let down by the musical depth of tonys xbox debut
rest assured all the songs from the original playstation release of thps are here in their entirety
however one of the unlockable features of this xbox remake is the entire first game of the series as well as five new levels unique to this version
i wouldve assumed that neversoft would have at least incorporated the outstanding soundtrack from the first game here seeing as how they were including every other aspect of that game
it was not to be however perhaps because of licensing issues and what youre left with in the end is an extremely long game and an extremely short repetitive soundtrack
the masters behind this title do get brownie points however for not only utilizing the systems quotcustom soundtrackquot feature but for smoothly incorporating it into the game itself
not only can you quickly and easily listen to the music youve ripped from a collection of personal cds but each song fades out after two minutes in the career mode like all the other songs in the gamewhen its all said and done a few minor gripes do not a bad game make
this wasnt a flawless translation of the incredible original game but it wasnt a bastardizing of its legacy either
if you missed out on this one when it was first released on the psone id advise you grab it while its still around
otherwise id say you should steer clear unless the prospect of custom soundtracks interests you enough to repurchase and replay an old title or twothis game gets to be very fun especially if the people your playing against are pros at the game
the only problem is my game keeps on freezing
it is not the system because all of my other games work nfl feaver cell damage nhl fusion frenzy halo thpsx amped project gotham racing and blood wake
very strangepro skater is a skateboarding game like no other first chose from  pro skaters each with their own tricks stats and special moves or create your own custom made pro skater
then have them skate in eight detailed skate parks several more hidden
the price of this game is so low because it is dated and the graphics are a huge step up from the playstation and n versions such as very detailed textures and even graffiti looks great
the xbox version of this game does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong
this game came out after tony hawk  had come out and could have included several upgrades from the superior tony hawk  game
the makers of the game did not use the xbox to its full capability such as having limitless saves for replays created skaters and created skate parks
there are no custom soundtracks either which is a huge let down with the xboxs hard drive able of keeping music on it
the game really needs to be divided into three parts the tony hawk pro skater  part that has eight courses to skate on where for each course there are a number of goals to accomplish for each such getting high scores by earning points from performing tricks grinds and jumps over gaps like building to building collecting the letters skate grinding three rails jumping over fire hydrants and various other things they vary from level to level
when you complete a goal you get money to gain cash that you can buy new skateboards upgrades to better your skater and you can also buy bigger tricks
the second part comes after you complete the tony hawk  game then it unlocks a new career the tony hawk pro skater x which consists of five all new courses exclusively for the xbox
the levels are a nigh club in london a construction site in texas a skate park in tampa bay the skate park is also in tony hawks underground and two fictional areas the subway and a skatepark with large grinds
there are new goals to do but you do not get money for completing these goals
these courses are very lack luster and look more like they were rejected from tony hawk pro skater  which brings us to the third part of the game
once you go through three of the tony hawk x levels that unlocks the old tony hawk pro skater  levels
you can skate through them pretty quickly even with the upgraded textures there are no other improvements to the tony hawk  levels
the game has twentyfour courses in allthis is a solid game and i recomend this and if you like this game expect to like the next ones
i personally love the game but wished i would have saved my money so i could by  and  right away
i think  it is a good game either wayalthough i cant say this game can top the rogue squadron game line it is still fun
i would definitly recomend this game to anyone who loves airial star wars games
i thought it was greati have an xbox and have had one since the th i love halo pgr doa madden
i was hoping for a little more from lucas
this is a fun game but its does not have all that lucas could be doing for these games
this game should have delivered so much more and is in no way a reflection of the xboxes full potential
yes being a star wars fan i had to have this game yet it has been a small let down
i gave it a four out of five more graphics than playability
it really is about a   but i get tired of seeing all the fake reviews prior to this last week when the game came out
dont beleive half of what you read on these reviews
try this games yourself rent them first if your resistant
but overall xbox is the real thing and i am looking forward to lucasarts to deliver a true xbox game in the futurei loved x evo so naturally i wanted to try version   finally had an opportunity to purchase an xbox and well this game is darn cheap at costco so what the heckthe game hasnt changed too much from the first version
now teams are available which is a nice toucha nd the cars and track list is increasedthe same gripe i had about the first game still applies though
when you purchase an upgrade the computer automatically gets it
if you are winning races and thus earning money shouldnt the computer have to do the same
essentially the rule of thumb is only mod your truck to things you need to be a bit more competative but not to make a monster truck
once you have everything youd want in a truck the computer is sure to beat youwhere this game really shines is in two player mode
computer cant cheat this way and its just you and a buddy beating up a couple of trucks
lets face it its pretty fun to beat up your own suv and not have to worry about repair billsthe fully open courses also make the game very fun
in free drive mode you can practice the courses and plan for the short cuts which are mandatory if you want to win some racesdefinitely worth the price i bought it forsince i bought the xbox halo and madden  have reigned supreme for me so far
x evo is a good game its fun and the graphics are ok  what seems to be lacking is that its to easy to complete it didnt take long to join a team and buy the top vehicles
also it appears that the game tries to keep the races interesting because when you fall behind all the other racers will slow down but if your in first palce they go like bats from hell to pass you
also as a jeep owner i was pleased to see that they included jeep this timelisten the first review is from a kid that doesnt have the game and is basing his opinion on a bad review he read in a magazinethis review is from someone who owns the game
it is awesome
if you like racing or offroading get it
it has a career mode similar to gt and some really fun adventures where you have goals that are all x relatedton of fun
heck with the quotrealquot reviews
this is a game for the peopledont get me wrong
i rated this game highly and i stand by my review score
the game has done many things correctly and being an xbox launch title its amazing that it came out this good
the graphics are unrealyears ago we dreamed about realism like this
everything looks photorealistic with real shadowing
xbox power is truly evident here
the sounds are pretty sparse but get the job done
the control is sosodefinitely go with the advanced controllers set up to enable lateral movement with the triggers but beware this takes some time to get used to
the missions are fun and diverse but therein lies the problem
the game is hard on some levels and if you are unsuccessful in a mission you start back in the shop screen and are forced to buy or switch to a new plane and then you must backtrack to the mission where you failed
thats wouldnt be such a big deal but there are times when you must complete several smaller submissions in order to access the main mission area
the submissions are rather boringtake out a plane or two or some ground targets
dont take any careless damage in these missions because you need all the hit points you can get for the larger missions
after a few tries the game clicks and you begin to progress but the whole restarting and backtracking aspect does begin to try your patience after a while
no mulitplayer either but i really dont care too much about thati love the game and im glad i own it
however once you beat the game if youre skilled enough the incentive to go back and play the game again isnt high enough because of the repetition involvedfor some reason this game is very hard for me but i keep coming back for more
must be thick in the head
all arcade action which is great flexability in aircraft another good thing and arcade graphics
i have played another version of this on the dc and never got through it but was compelled to get it for the xbox because it was hard on the dreamcast but was fun
still is
not for the quoti want an f sim on my xboxquot crowd if such a crowd exists but a good competitor to ac from psthis game has a great presentation and looks awesome
i was in awe of the graphics the wrestlers look very real and the entrances are great to watch
the strong point of the game though is being able to create a wrestler although frustrating at first once you go through it a few times you will find amazing outfits to outfit your wrestler to be with
the game plays well but is at times a bit odd and doesnt have a great flow to it
at first you will struggle with pulling off huge moves but fear not you will after time be pulling huge moves on all the superstars
the major downfall is the lack of modes of play no ladder no cage matches no royal rumble or create a ppv which is sorely missed
i would only recommend this game to a true fan of wrestling its pretty much just something to play until they make another game that improves on this onewhich i believe will happen
otherwise its a must rent and can be lots of fun
if not a wrestling fan i would say its a good game to rent but not to own
you will get tired of the lack of options and the poor gameplay because if your not a fan you will not understand how it plays and will for sure get pissed off and yell at the screen for awhile
i know been there done thati picked up wwf raw because i used to love pro wrestling on the nes
i also liked wrestlemania in the arcade
but i havent followed wrestling since i was  years old
so lets just say im not partial to any recent wrestling gamesthe createaplayer feature makes this game worthwhile
i made edward scissorhands with the robot skin and cannon hands with the robert smithlike face
my other guy has green hair and a big yellow puppet for a hand that he smacks people around with
you can set all the lighting for the intro which is lots of fun
the move configuration is almost like programming with about  different situational moves facing backward running groggy etci do find the fact that you have to choose your opponents in nonsingle player modes annoying
id like to just choose a tag team with a friend and not have to select another  players to fill out the bracket
i also wish you could simulate a match without having to go past the intros and then press start again to get back to the menu and then two more times to get to your next playable matchi think a lot of reviewers didnt quite get the jist of the controls
much like previous wrestling games you have striking attacks to weaken your opponent a bit before you grapple them
you use x blue to strike then with a red you grab and then you can body slam etc
in order to win the battle of the voltage meter you have to mix up your moves kinda like amped or you feed their voltage meter even when youre kicking the stuffing out of them on the ground
the graphics are amazingthe lighting and character models are very well done
if you arent hung up on some previous generation wrestling game and would like a good party game with  controllers itd be a riot give wwf raw a shotwwf is a great game for wrestling fansthe graphics are good but not great lacking some of the textures we see on other gamesbut the gameplay of this game is great
anything is possible which makes this game greatwwf offers a whole lot every match avalable almost every wrestler and even createawrestler which is so awesomebut after awhile of playing the game its starts to get old and boring at times
this game id say whould have to be a rental
but if you really like wrestling this games for youwwf raw has a fantastic wrestling engine which goes a long way towards making this game enjoyable
it looks and feels like youre in control of a wwf match from beginning to end and this is what wrestling games are supposed to give us
i was a huge fan of no mercy and wrestlemania  on n and this feels like a huge next generation leap forward from those games in terms of gameplay
im not sure how wrestlemania x is going to turn out on gamecube but i know long time nintendowrestling fans would definitely want something like rawthe lack of a true career mode hurts this game the same way it hurts sports games that merely pay lip service to this feature
i had lofty expectations for the first xbox wrestling game and i wanted to see complicated interactive chooseyourown adventure type story modes
even though i was being very unrealistic its still disappointing that raw with this title match mode does not even attempt any sort of true careerstory modewith that said raw does a whole lot more good than bad and its still a game that xbox owners need to pick up if they have even the slightest interest in the wwf
im not sure if theres such a thing as casual wwfxbox fan but raw will appeal to them as well with its outstanding wwf realism
the hardcore fans will get plenty of enjoyment out of the difficult ai the awesome multiplayer modes and the super deep createawrestler modei am not a wrestling fan at all
however a friend talked me into buying the game
with no expecatations i think this should be fairthe game is a slower game than other fighting games
however from what i have seen of wwf it represents itself perfectly
wwf is not hongkong fooey fighting it is stage theatrics that have calculated moves to entice ethusiams and support for a particular wrestler
the graphics are outstanding and the sounds are great
personally i have not won a match yet
i have only played about  and i certainly am gettting the hang of itmy advice is to understand what you want from a game then decide if you want raw
think of it this way if you really want a fighting game get dead or alive  if you want the thrill and fantasy of being a member of the wwf get raw
it is fun and mixing it up with a couple of mates over a few pints will only increase that funtheres nothing wrong wit this game
but there are a couple of flaws
 not enough wrestlers not enough match types action  slow  stupid ai the caw mode wrestlers look different from other wrestlers
only  spots  caws event hough xbox has  of free space
thats mainly it the game has ppretty okay graphic but sum wrestler like hhh is absolutely ugly
another thing the items you can put on your head looko like its glued on and the caw boots sux
the game play is alrite theres no career mode but the belt is okayoverall is the first xbox game of course my expectations was high but it is still playablethq has done it againif you buy this gameyoull think you were there sitting in the front rowgraphics were greeeatwellthis game isnt bad but it has some bad qualities that make the game stink sometimes
first off you cant lay people on tables and its hard to actually put people through them either
being unable to climb ladders really sucks and the career mode isnt all that great
other than thatm the game is pretty oki mean the graphics are awesomeentrances characters looks movement makes it seem real
the create a wrestler feature is ok but if you were trying to make a female like i was there wasnt much selection as no mercy
it is weird for a girl to write a wrestling game review but i have been a wrestlingwrestling game fan for a while now and i really like beating my friends up in the game if you are a wrestling fan or actionfighting fan this game is pretty good but it if you hate wrestling or anything to do with the wwf stay away from this
i would probably recomend this game being it the best wrestling game graphics out there but it really isnt as great as everyone is portrayingthis is one of my few gripeswhen your out on the streets in my favorite car the infernus and ur goin about ur own buisness and get attackedthe cops go right by as if nothing is going onif you attack back well the cops are gunna moon you to deaththats my only gripe now im going to be psycho like all the othersthis game kicks
great graphics soooo many cars to get
this doesnt even need the cheats to make it goodyou can have enough fun in the first town without doing any missions to make you grieve that you could plays this all the timei wish this had multiplayerbut what it lacks it makes up in with choicesyou can go onto dump st and still find all the cars u need
this game the bums arent really bums in my thoughtsi mean could a bum afford  fire blast grenades or when u kill them they drop like  bucksonly cheat i always like to have is the improved car handlingbe very careful this thing is so addictive that if a kid had the time and was allowed the time heshe would be on it for  months rarely going to sleepafter you complete the first  cities it gets very easythe ending of this is bad thoughi kind of kick myself for going to rescue the chick in the last mission and then when your walking with her taking her home shes jabbering nonstop and then saying about her hair gunna cost like  bucks to put it back and then you here the gunshot and silencei wasted  days tryen to rescue her and died  times for herpunk teenagerif you dont know them ill put it a few cheatshealthr r l r left down right up left down right upthats all im putting cause its  am and i wanna go to bed
but this game is very confusing at some points like in the beggining you dunno what the heck is going on
well it is kinda fun somtimes to get in the boat and shoot on the road and have cops coming and falling in the watera few twitchesoverallvery good gamewarningnot intended for childs use this game can persuade them to want to do this in their livesshould be at least  to play thisif under this age and u let ur child play id worry about their futureit is an exciting game for me but the characters are often the same boring duplicates and pretty impersonal
i was hoping that the characters would be more realistic for example it would be even more exciting if a character was very physically expressive when talking to another need physical facial expression like moving the mouth when talking or using facial expression physically when expressing emotions such as anger happiness interested or just bored etc
it is not necessarily for the characters to be clones of one another
face it in the real world unless we are twins or triplets we are in fact unique as an individual
other than that love the car chases landscape and the soundwhat a great game
playing on gta on the pc was fun but now they have gta  for ps
if youve played this game on the pc youll have no trouble controlling this game
gta  provides hours of fun
the game and its dialogue is for an adult audience and definitely isnt for kids
every facet of the game is outstanding the graphics control sound and endless replay value
this is one game that you will be playing for quite awhilethis is the funniest game i have played in a long time
the mayhem that this game allows you to create and be a victim of is truly breathtaking
i bought this game a few months ago and have just got around to playing it
i must say it has turned out to be much better than i thought it woulda fun game
while not as fun as gtavc the game has great graphics
if youre ever bored just screw around and shoot some people or go on rampages
violent yet greatthis is a great game as so many other reviews have stated
i love the fact that anything goes in this game you can pick up hookers in your stolen car and watch it creak up and down as your money dwindles you can fight anyone int he game and go practically anywhere
the missions are fun and very challenginghowever there is one flaw and thats the combat
combat in this game is attrocious
you have almost zero control over the character and his weapon
the r button is supposed to lock your weapon on an enemy but often it locks onto the wrong person in critical situations
for example theres a mission in the game where a gang of psychos strapped with bombs run at you kamakazi style so you have to shoot them at a distance to avoid damage
i found my weapon constantly locking on innocent civilians and getting blown to bits over and overthe other major flaw in the combat  is the third person view
its very awkward and makes it very difficult to attack enemies on your flanks or behind you
this is because the game does not allow you to run and look around at the same time
they camera only points in the direction your character is running
in halo and max payne you can swivel the camera as you move to get at enemies in all directions and thats how combat should have been handled here as welli almost wanted to give the game  stars because of these flaws because theyre so aggravating but all the other aspects are so great that i couldnt do that
this definitely is a game thats worth buying and playing but just be ready for a little frustration when you get into gunfightsmy first experience w the gta franchise was at my friends birthday party in dec  he received gta as a gift that night and we all watched him play it for a while
lots of drunken hooting and hollering at the wanton random violence and depravity
running over pedestrians copkilling sprees with countless innocent bystander casualties partaking of a prostitutes services for a health bonus and then beating her to death with a baseball bat to recoup the money paid to her and so forth
i didnt dig that particular aspect too much
i wasnt personally offended per se i love over the top violence in games and movies
but i had something of a political issue with it due to my perspective as a longtime gamer
to wit for two decades up to that point annoying concerned parent groups had been decrying video games as murder simulators that condition and desensitize destroy the moral compass blah blah blah
those groups had always been completely full of crap but it seemed to me that in one fell swoop gta  was going to make them all correct retroactively
i thought weve been in the right all these years
but now youve released the game those nitwits have been waiting for and its finally going to give them the upper hand
good job guys
there was also the simple fact that ive always been more drawn towards fantasy whether its futuristic scifi swords  sorcery supernatural horror a past time period whatever i need something aside from mundane reality
a video game where youre a just some joe schmoe running around a modern city driving contemporary cars that simply wasnt going to satisfy my appetite for escapism
so it felt like around the time i was going gaga over devil may cry ico metal gear solid  final fantasy x and halo everyone else was falling madly in love with gta
especially my aforementioned friend
he would not shut up about how great it was and he was so enthusiastic and positive that id love it too if i gave it a chance that i bought myself a copy
i played it for a few hours long enough to confirm that it definitely wasnt my cup of tea and i put it away in the cabinet under my tv
its been sitting in there ever sincei then watched as gta went on to become one of the most revolutionary and influential video games of all time giving birth to a whole new genre ie
open worldsandbox
naturally i avoided this genre like the plague until assassins creed
i initially dismissed that game as well since a i had never been won over by prince of persiasands of time and b it appeared to be gta set in the th century middle east
but later i heard that it also had some kind of hitech scifi aspect so that piqued my interest and i ended up playing it
flawed as it was that broke the ice and got me past my aversion towards open world games
after three assassins creeds infamous red dead redemption and most recently la noire i was finally ready
i opened that cabinet under my tv fished out gta and started a new game
that was about two weeks ago and now ive finished it
a lot of it was boring theres no getting around the fact that you spend most of your time driving around liberty city
i drive around los angeles every day so this is not exactly exciting to me
bits of it were aggravating in the first  missions or so the gps always indicates precisely where my next goal is and suddenly that is taken away for no apparent reason
im directed to go find a yardie car without any info as to just what in the hell a yardie is or kind of car they drive
yknow the sort of thing that official guide books and the internet were created for
but a lot of it was a hell of a lot of fun and im glad that i can finally appreciate what it did for gaming
thanks to ebay after finishing up gta i cracked open an original sealed copy of vice city and started in on that i can already tell it contains some big improvements and ive got a sealed copy of san andreas waiting in the wings
now my biggest issue with these games is whether or not i can finish them before i burn outedit august   since writing this review ive gone on to enjoy vice city san andreas gta the lost and damned and the ballad of gay tony
i am now a true blue gta fan
whoda thunk it
ive been looking up old articles and interviews about the history of gta and its developer rockstar and i found out something very enlightening when they initially came up with the ideas that were the foundation for the gta series one of the most important goals was to create a new game that would appeal to people who normally werent interested in video games because they thought of them as nerdy
being that i had been playing and loving video games for about  years by the time gta first appeared in  its hardly any wonder that it didnt interest me
i wasnt anywhere near the target demographici purchased grand theft auto  after playing grand theft auto vice city
this game is okay but dont think it is as cool as vice city
i enjoy the missions involved with gta but some of them get repetitive the marty chonks missions
i like that the citizens of liberty city fight back whereas vice city citizens tend to mind their own business
another thing the soundtrack doesnt have many songs and the main character doesnt talk he just nods his head from time to time
the game is crazy mad fun and i enjoy it thouroughly
if you are used to playing vice city you will quickly learn your limitations
you cant jump on cars as easily you cant use bats or guns to breka windows
you may be taking a step back in time playing it now but it is enjoyableif you take this game at its face value and dont spend too much time comparing it to vice city you can enjoy this gamewell this game is great i played it for months and was the reason i baught a ps
but now its old and i ahve other games to play the reason it got old i thought though was that it didnt have enough storyline
i finished the story and got kinda bored of lookign for hidden packages and rampages and whatnot
i would rahter be told to kill this or that guy and steal this than jsut randomly doing itok enough of the bad this game has good graphics and some great stories and lots of neat cars to drive
lovely wreaks and movement of cars as well
sometimes other cars jsut driving along will go crazy and run from you some peopel you pull out of there cars shoot or try to beat you up
its got such a great choas factor in it
i do wish they would of added a two player mode though i fell they could have easilythis is a rare game that seems to utilize the full power of the ps
i am amazed at how far they come since the first gta a groundbreaking game in itself for its time
the graphics are outstanding gameplay is smooth and nonlinear so instead of marching right off to the next mission you can heist some more cars make some jumps steal a taxi and collect fares beat up some unsuspecting pedestrians whatever you want the missions will wait for you
it can be bloody and violent so it has earned its rating but for the mature crowd that knows right from wrong and views this as escapist entertainment it is a fabulous gamei dont think video games can top their  year at least in sales total
this was one of  major hits from rockstar in the  year max payne being the other
i have to say they did a wonderful job on improving over the old ps games which are fun aswell even now they are very fun
this gave us a chance to wonder around three different areas of liberty city nyc
even though the story is lackluster almost just throwing missions at you without reason
but gameplay is amazing almost no limits at least in length you always find something different in the city and can kill anything laughs
while the main character doesnt talk at all finally talks in vice city
overall gta fans and even new fans will loves this megahitthis game represents everything that is wrong with the video game industry on a single shiny disc
it glorifies just about everything that we used to teach our kids not to do
a typical mission involves killing a drug dealer with a baseball bat and stealing his car you can top it all off with a trip to the local bordello to replenish your health and if you dont feel like wasting money on a hooker you can always kill her and take your money back  such wonderful lessons these games teach nowadays
remember when all we had to worry about was blowing up icbms with a trackballnow having said that i want to say that i enjoyed this game a great deal
i like the open ended nature of the gameplay i like the fact that they used real actors for the voice acting instead of the typical friends of the programmers that you get in most games  i even like the different radio stations you can listen to when your driving around in a freshly jacked hummvee
and yes i even like the backdoor commentary about our revolving door legal system that dumps killers and thieves back on the streets once it catches them though it was probably not intentionalbut then im  years old probably too old for video games but thats another argument
furthermore im smart enough to know that the behaviors glorified in the game are beyond reprehensible in the real world
the problem with this game is that there are surely a lot of people playing it who shouldnt be
and not just the under  crowd that shouldnt even be able to look at this game in a store it should be behind the counter like porn at a bookstore let alone buy it
im talking about that percentage of the market that wants more than a murder simulator
i dont believe that this game will turn ordinary peaceable people into cold blooded murderers but i do believe that there are people teetering on the edge and that this game wont exactly help them find the path of righteousnessnow having subjected you to the ranting of my own social conscience let me discuss the technical merits of the game
the graphics are first rate
your character animates well though his sprinting animation is downright comical and the people around him react in realistic ways to his presence
cars all look like what they look like and the streets are amazingly detailed you even see old newspapers floating on the breeze
the weather generator blew my mind
youll get sun fog light rain heavy rain thunder storms complete with lightning forks in the sky and all sorts of atmospheric detailsthe sound is really where this game excels though
youll get snippets of conversations as you walk by people
drivers will shout obscenities at you in various languages when you block traffic or steal their car
car engines sound pretty much all the same but you wont notice with the radio stations on
there are nine of them each representing a different flavor of radio rap reggae classical latin pop oldies and even talk radio are represented complete with djs and original songsthe game control is good but the camera has some problems
on certain missions it can be hard to target the person you want to kill which will result in your untimely demise if youre not fast on your feet
you can pick from a number of camera angles on foot and from another set of angles in vehicles but the default angles are the most usefuldetail can make a game and this game has the detail
everything you do has a consequence everything of course except killing people for that they just make you start over
if you leave a car in the middle of the street it will create a traffic jam where you can hear everyone honking and screaming at the empty car
people fall down when you bump into them
if you sprint too far your character will double over and catch his breath
when you hire a prostitute the car rocks and squeaks as you ahem recharge
aiming a gun at passersby will get a variety of reactions
some will put up their hands and scream
others will take out their own guns and shoot you and who said that concealed carriers dont stop crime
your car leaves tiremarks on the road when you use the handbrake
your car takes damage exactly as you would expect it to
doors dent windows smash fenders crumple and hoods buckle just as you would expect them to after hitting a fire hydrant doing  mph
in fact hitting a fire hydrant produces the requisite geyser from where the hydrant wassumming up there are things called guilty pleasures and this is certainly one of them
if i could change one thing in the game industry it would probably be to stop this game and even the two prequels from ever being made
but i cant and its here
i may as well enjoy it
and i do this game is a lot of funand if you can handle it youll probably think so too
just remember the next time you hear about some riot in seattle killing people and destroying property games like this promoted it
its not cause and effect but its an environmental factor that we cant afford to ignore
go back and read the first clause in that last sentence again in case you want to characterize me as a disciple of tipper gore
so have fun but thinkthis game is exactly what you have heard it is
its wild out of control fun
you are a desperate guy out on the streets of a rough city looking to get paid for doing mob bosses dirty work
you steal cars start fights in the street launch rockets into peoples driver side windows and even hit old ladies over the head with a baseball bat
and the best part of all
its now in d if you loved gta and  on ps your gonna think this is the best game you have ever played fun wise
you can either play the missions which are fun or go around causing hell
its fun either way you do it
there are also tons of cheat codes available which give you all weapons  health and all the other odds and ends that make cheat codes a perfect compliment for this game
there are the positivesnegatives
not many if your just looking for a fun game
the only thing is it may get old running around blowing things up after a while
its not as story driven as a max payne one of the greatest games in gaming history or metal gear solid but its fun
take it for what its worth
its one of those games you have to have with ps
not the greatest game on the system but probably the most entertaining
enjoythis game is among the best shooting games out there
a long game with some real fun and challenging missions
you should go out and buy it trust me itll be worth your moneywe have had a ton of fun with this one
im still no good at it but it is a blastgrand theft auto  is an amazingly violent game
run out of ammo why not bash a guy to death with a baseball bat or mowdown a couple hundred cops and pedestrians with an uzzi or better yet why not blow them up with a rocket launcherthe game revolves around a main character who happens to be looking for lessthanlegal work in the city and he quickly finds that his special talents are in great demand especially as he moves up the syndicated crime ladder
at first i couldnt see the appeal of a game that allows the character to steal cars just not that fun yet when i played the game and realized the depth that rockstar put into this mayhem projector the appeal was clearsteal a car or better yet steal a cop car ambulance taxi firetruck and you will be able to carryout more missions
the police car opens the vigilante mission surprise while the ambulance challenges you to take someone safely to the nearest hospital with the fewest bumps possiblegta  offers hours of gameplay for the avid gamer that is if heshe doesnt use the cheat codes for itbottom line i saw mothers buying this game for their preteen children and was a little disturbed perhaps they just were unaware or simply too willing to please
this game is playable for the mature teen as the rating would suggest and would be grossly inappropriate for a young gamer
in the end you must decide and if you choose this game it will be fun albeit a little traumatic even for the seasoned gamerjake
mgrand theft auto iii is oldschool gta before character and vehicle mods celebrity voiceovers and next generation graphics
its just intended to be fun and it is thatyou play a goombah in liberty city a cartoonish version of new york whos just trying to make his bones in the mafioso underworld of the time
starting as a neighborhood nobody youre gonna have to lie cheat and steal your way to the top
basically youre an amoral thug and you love every second of it
you push over the police and run down rival gang members
you instigate streetlevel shootouts and firebomb cars
you run drugs and assassinate bad men for big money
well theyre badder than the character you play anyhowin between there are a variety of fun submission like races delivery drops garbage collection jobs and rampages where you need to kill as many people as possible using whatever weapon youre provided with  which is everything from an explosive rc car to a sniper riflethe story is not so serious as the others probably the funniest of the bunch
while poking fun at both the godfather movies and of course goodfellas it also includes a couple unexpected twists like when the main characters own mother sells him out
hilarious sequence to play throughdriving is so smooth you almost dont need the missions
almost
its just fun to drive around causing mayhem
and there are costume changes for the first time like the hockey mask version of tony and new weapons like the chainsaw
san andreas will build on all of this and vice city has a much better story but for its time this was the gta gamenot as great of a soundtrack as the others have but maybe thats just because its dated nowbut as far as fun i cant think of any ps games i enjoyed more  except maybe one or two of the other gta titlesi like it it is a pretty good game so i give it about a  outta gta  is cool very fun game play reduces lots of stress
whether your stealing some cars or sniper shooting people off of roofs this game rocksafter playing gta and gta i must say that the birdseye view got really old
the new thirdpersonfirstperson view brings a much needed face lift to the gta series
gameplay is smooth with the large levels having a ton of detail
the storyline is a good progression and its nice not to have to be limited to only one storyline
if you like working for a certain boss do all of his missions or do none
the game isnt dependant upon which missions you complete some exceptions
the ability to get in a boat car tank etc makes the monotony of just driving around go away
there are numerous secrets to discover in all of the cities
overall i would recommend this game as a stressreliever hello flamethrower and bazooka
or a good rpggrand theft auto  is one of the most highest grossing ps game ever and remains as rockstars greatest achievement in gaming
this game is a classic and is a must own for any ps owneryou play the role of a criminal who got an early bust out and now is on the road to revenge and mayhem
you start out with easy to do missions but then start to get harder like asassinating the worlds biggest mafia all the way to destroying planes
the game acctually has a really good mafia type storline
the main character doesnt talk but im glad cause that lets us imagine
the game has its pros and cons and thats why i didnt give it a big  out of   the game has some really memorable parts and really great missionsthe missions in the game are superb but if youre in the mood on doing some mayhem and exploring you can acctually leave the missions aside and do em when ever you want just as long as youre not doing anymayhem after youve just triggered a mission
the game takes place in liberty citythen south central but with more of an attitude and much more semisafer with loads of crooked cops yakuza gangs and columbian cartells not to mention the triads
and yes the main character has to go through all of these punks in order to survive and get revenge to the woman who put him through all of this messthe best part about grand theft auto  is the memorable characters that youll adore but the only con i had with the characters is that most of them dont end with and ending like you wont take em to some house and get a good bye once youve finished there missions its over and youll never see em again though there is one person you work for that acctually has an ending for him
the game overall has really great memorable characters
i really enjoyed this game back when it first came out i was a few to get the game when it first came out and i hear stupid rumors that if you get the very first version of the game that was released some were in  youll see spider man and batman
i dont believe that thoughthe game consists of many missions to do and but loads of arsenals of weapons like the shotgun machine gun and the bat
the game has great controll
very easy to use and will get use to it withen  minutes
the games music is fantastic and has a great selection of them and i loved the radio station with lazlo that was really great
rockstar tried to make this as real as possible even though it is abit cartoony then again it doesnt try to be too realistic
overall the music and controlls is a plus one
the game really had one major flaw and that is that the game becomes very tedious later and that the visuals arnt as great as many has said to be
the visuals could have bin better like saymax payne  better ohwellthe violence in this game is not graphic nor disturbing but cartoonybloody violent and this games profanity isnt as hardcore as manhunt or max payne  which are worse  the game does deserve its mature rating because well lets face it the game is really violent
the game is from my opinion not recommended for kids under the age of at least 
now lets get to itgoodmany missions to do and lots of places to exploremany cool aray of weapons including the flamethrowerlots of memorible characters also most of these characters are seen in san andreas like catalina and the gta character alsolots of cool fast paced action to keep you on the edge of your seatgreat level desighn on liberty citywhen bored youll have a blast just doing mayhem to the people on liberty citygreat selection of musicbadit was a bit shortif you do the missions that trigger storyline missions only you could beatthis game inless then  hoursgets abit repetitive and frustraiting later onthe visuals wernt that greatcould have bin betterthe uglykilling salvetore leoneheheheoverall this is a fast paced action adventure of crime and vengence with buttloads of missions to do and great voice acting by some really great actors like micheal madesonkill bill resivour dogs species i and iiand has some really memorable missions and great weapons of choiceoverall this ps classic gets a out of  starslatesgta  is crazy
i enjoyed roaming around and doing some of the missions
however i dont recommend this game for children due to the violent themesgta  is a pretty good game some of the missions are mindless i find the game camera horrible but it is senseless digital violence almost at its best and if you are in to that get thisif not go trade pokemon cards with your friendsoh my god
what a great game
a huge upgrade from gta  and london if your thinking about getting vice city
then dont
why
ill tell you whyfirst of gta  is more realistic its much darker in the streets just like the real place   unlike gta vice city its too colourful like teletubbies mixed with buubaas dancing around the streets together
its pathetic
yeah yeah in gta vice city you can ride moterbikesthats a big wow
more weapons in gta vice city but you can only hold a cirtain amount of them theres like  weapons and you can only hold  of them
what a rip offgta  missions are wicked
about  missions in total  citys to explore loads of cars wicked cars what more would you ask forbuy it dont rent itthis was a great game
i will admit
but somehow many excellent games were overshadowed by it
nevertheless this was the sleeper hit game of the year which prob
wont be outdone by vice city
only time can tell
wait a few weeks for this to go to  bucks too
im sure it will become a greatest hit any week nowi really enjoy grand theft auto  i ended up playing it on a whim my boyfriend was playing it one day and after i asked him a bunch of questions about it he handed over the cds to me
hes never gotten them backone of the things i like about gta is the freedom you have in the game
if you want to run around liberty city just exploring for an hour you can do it and not screw up your game
you can also push and go right through all the scenarios if youd like and skip the extra things like rampages hidden packages and side missions like playing taxi driverive spent hours on this game running people around in the taxi so i can get the borgnine taxi red taxi with a pointy pedestrian guard
ive found all  hidden packages tried to complete all the rampages found all the cars on the lists in portland and shoreside vale and just wandered around and explored
ive also spent hours on the missions themselves taking most of one afternoon and multiple failed attempts to complete the very last missioni think the game is great and it deserves its mature rating
people swear you run people down with your car shoot cops pick up hookers and do a variety of unsavory things
its not a kids game its a game for adults or at the very least teens that can understand why it deserves its mature ratinggta is great but my perception of a good grand theft auto game is tainted by vice city so i an only give this  stars
i would have liked the ability to repeat failed rampages and possibly a few more side missions
i can only run around playing vigilante or taxi driver so long or collect so many cars
marty chonks side missions and people like el burro king courtney and dice give some relief to the basic storyline but not that muchgrand theft auto  is still one of the most innovative and overall fun games available for the playstation   in this review i will reveal some annoying parts of the game and various glitchesthe annoying cannot shoot drivers through car windows cannot shoot tires to cause blowouts only about five buildings can be entered by foot or by vehicle pedestrians walk around city blocks in circles forever not entering buildings or getting in or out of cars the police will only come after you
even if there is a fullscale gang war involving  gang members shooting at each other in the streets the police will do nothing even if they are attacked
there should be active police chases involving other drivers
it would make the game a whole lot more funglitchesfalling throgh the street for no reason into infinity can be annoying but it almost never happens so dont be put offsome cars can be seen stuck in the fabric of matter such as buildings walls etcoverall gta  is a very good game
i just thought id share some of the negative aspectsi do reccomend san andreas and vice city over this one obviously but i still play it to this day so cant be all that bad right
this games super cheap now and well worth it in game timei have never played a game that can be called perfect
grand theft auto is no exception
while the game definately makes my alltime top ten list it has its flaws that cannot be ignored totallylets start with the good stuff first
there is definately more good than bad
this game involves a totally free world around you
go anywhere
do anything
steal any car
any car
you want a police car
you got it
ambulance
got it
the beauty is that with cars such as a police cruiser you can go on extra missions in this case vigilante missions in which you have to hunt down criminals and kill them before time runs out
if you steal a taxi cab you can play a deadly version of quotcrazy taxiquot
you can mug anyone
shoot anyone
beat anyone with a baseball batfolks this game is very violent and is not for anyone who cant tell the difference between right and wrong
i definately would reccomend that you keep this out of the hands of very small children
however it is important to note that everything in the game is done in good fun
it is a dark comedy very dark that is intended to make fun of the criminal life
it definately does not promote killing
its just a game
it is important to remember thatback to the game
once you get sick of going around and doing your own thing you can try your luck at the approx
 missions included in this game
these missions are how you advance in the game and advance the storyline
these missions are definately fun to do but they are where the games flaws come in
to complete some of the missions you must be very patient
many are easy but many are frustrating as well
the solution to the mission is not handed to you on a silver platter it shouldnt be games are supposed to be hardthe graphics are very good but can definately be better
driving around can be pain sometimes as the control is a little offbut im really being picky
these problems are very small
this game is one of the greatest ever and belongs in any mature ps gamers collection
if you dont have a ps this game is worth the purchase of one stars because even though the features are lacking the game was pretty much a launch title for the original xbox seeing how the copyright date says  on the gamestory mode is pretty short but still interesting to playthe fighting is fun but it gets old after a while this could be said about many fighting games i prefer tekkenthe graphics alone deserve a  stars or  stars at least
but rating the entire game gets a  stars
the actuall game play button configuration movements in environments the fighting style is pretty gooddecentetc
but it does get a little repetitive and the story line is a little shakey
if you are a die hare doa fan you should buy it
if you like the doa series id say rent it or try it out for an hour at a friends house or on a demo and then decide if you want to buy it or not
once you beat the game with everyone which doesnt take too long there is nothing much more to do except play a few more times or with a frienddead or alive  is and xbox exclusive installment in the fighting game series that is well known for its style
i had to give it four stars instead of five for a couple reasons
when looking at the collection in its entirety this one seems to offer almost the least
im sure when it was new it offered the most but since then they have rereleased  and  dead or alive  offers the leastand feels different then the rest but they added tons of costumes to dead or alive  ultimate
i picked up all of them up at the same time
so comparing them like that dead or alive  does offer plenty but you will find more in the others with the exception of the first
another thing to point out i played these on my xbox  and the only compatibility issues i had were with dead or alive  some of the ending clips either skip or dont play at all
so that is also something to consider because if i had the option i would only play this on the original xboxit is clear from the opening scenes that this game will provide you with awesome eye candy
the graphics are nothing less than perfect
it is so amazing how the fabric on the characters clothes even moves when they are jumping around
hey even body parts jiggle in this game
i was also impressed by the intricate martial arts movements each character possessed
and many of the awesome movements are simple to key in using your controller
these aspects of the game are truly alivenow for what i consider to be the dead aspects of the game  first the game play is not captivating
i had this game for about two days before i was totally bored with it
everything about this game seems redundant
in an age of dynamic games for dynamic gamers this game is simply to quotstreet fighterlikequot  once you defeat this game a few times does not take very long you are left with a shell without any reusable contentthis game is both dead and alive
i still give it four stars for the attempt at highly intricate movements and graphics
nice to have in your xbox collection for those days when all your video game friends are over and you all want to challenge each otherits too short
i beat it inside of a weekend
its meant to be a multiplayer game
the plot development is a joke there isnt any just some very vague scenes and dialogue that hint towards something
there are many modes which makes it good and there are some cheats but they are really only for different outfits for the characters
the official xbox magazine has said that there is going to be an addon disc for doa that will expand the outifts moves and arenas that should be out soon
but by far the best quality as with all xbox games is the graphics
wow
the action is also terrific
its a great game but i probably wont buy another fighter until later when mortal kombat deadly alliance releaseshowever i must warn you of a few things first though
one the single player made is easy boring a drag and without a good plot to back it up
in other words single player mode stinks
two this game doesnt own you without tag team mode
which means that without at least two controllers this game will not keep your attaintion up
now that weve that out of the way the gameplay is smooth and crisp the graphics are beautiful the girls arenevermind and the mutiplayer is great
however like i said without mutiplayer this game has little to no replay valuedead or alive  is the best fighting game i have ever played
the characters moves and stages are unique
the best part about it is how an opponent can be hit into electric fences kicked off rooftops and smashed through icicles and more
to maximaze the fun play with friends in single and tag battles
youre probally wondering if this game is so good why did you rate it  stars
thats because it is to short in story mode
you only fight  characters before you fight the master
the master is genra and he is a big pain to fight
dont get me wrong theres more than just story mode
you can play  other modes called time attack survival tag battle team battle versus sparring or practice modewatch mode and theater mode i reccomend this game to kids over this game has great graphics almost look like dead or alive for the  in fact the only problem with this game is i beat it in  mins its that easy on single player but good game for the most part the graphics in this game are incrediable
i played this game for hours
the movement of the characters is very good
sometimes it looks like you hit the person but it doesnt do anything
once you learn the controls
it is a good game to purchaselike a kid in a candy store i just cant have enough of doa
the game looks so sweet it makes my eyes ache
doa has established itself as a formidable contender in the fighting game genre along side with other great titles like tekken virtua fighter and street fighter
this installment on the xbox is the best looking fighter game currently availablegraphics tecmos team ninja has really showed off xbox graphics power with doa
i dont want to be repetitive just let me say every graphical aspects of this game ie
character models background lighting shadows different effects etc are perfect
everything runs smoothly and beautifully
one thing worth mentioning is that xbox has great builtin antialias function
most of other xbox games quotlookquot and quotfeelquot dull and blend because antialias blurs out sharp edges so the d models dont quotstand outquot as much
miraculously team ninja utilizes this antialias technology discretely and make the proper things look quotstands outquot and others properly blended into the backgroudsound music and sound effects are well done
i cannnot say i am impressed with the soundtrack or that any of the sound effects are special
the game sounds good i dont believe team ninja put too much emphasis on the sound departmentgameplay button mashing
skills
i do not think it is relevent
like many other games you can invest a fraction of you life and perfect those  chained combos and whatnot or you can just button mash
the game does provide those  options
which ever way you choose to play your game most importantly is that its funvalue not as many features to be unlocked like other installments but it still has extra goodies to keep you interested in discovering the whole game
the tag team mode can be a whole new game by itself because the tag attacks are fun and very well done
the recent release of addons discs for north america consumers adds even more costumes quality costumes not chessy ones to the game
when you want some quick fighting action you can always come back to doa or when you are extremely lonely you can always come back for tinaoverall i really like this game
it is fun and beautiful
it is definitely worth purchasing if you own an xbox
i dont usually recommend purchasing a game however this game is so sweet to look at that you should just buy and play the game on quotwatch modequot to show off to yourself and your neighbors 
with what they have accomplished so far with doa i cant wait for the next team ninja title on xboxif you liked the tekken series you love this one even morethis is all about speed  power and the graphics are awesomethis game has a lot going for it and is one of the best fighting games of all times
there couldve been some better options and the story mode couldve been a little less fragmented but overall a musthave for whatever level of gamer you areokay so we all know that halo is the best xbox game out there
but we need more then one game to play on our shiny new xboxs rightdoa is a sheep wrapped in wolfs clothing well a very cool sheep anyways
im not the biggest fan of fighting games but i found this title to be quite entertaining
from a purely gameplay standpoint it certainly holds up
not the best fighting game in the world but a damn solid onethe really exceptional part about doa is the graphics
animation is smooth and fluid with breathtaking effects yes i know its an overused term but the graphics really are amazing
this has to be the most graphically inspired game i have ever played
if your looking for a showpiece title this one qualifies easily
the anime style characters are nice to look at and the level design is borderline obsessive
seriously levels look confined at first until you knock your opponent out of a window and see them fall  feet to the ground and continue to fightif you like d fighting games or if your looking for a showpiece title then by all means pick this one up
however its hardly a must have title
lots of fun sure but not nearly as much replay value as halo
of course nothing in my recent experience has the replay or fun factor of halo but as far as a great looking d fighter goes this game rocksthis game is a very nice fighing game for the xbox
the nice crisp graphics make the characters come to life
also the movements of the fighters look very realistic in every way you could think of a real martial artist moves like
the levels of the game arent just a background it is more interactive than you think in most fighting games
you can punch people out of walls of high buildings or off a cliff into another part of the level
you can also hit people into walls or other objects to make your blow more effective
this is the best fighting game there is on xbox its only  because its been over a year and doa online is coming out january   this is the fighting game that can last you a long timethe games graphics are stunningly beautiful
the different fighting styles of the characters are fun to explore
there is a wide range of moves some quite spectacular that each character can perform
still with all this the gameplay isnt particularly captivating
fun to play yes but not too deep
finally while practice will increase your skill you can go a long way in this game by simple button mashingim back again for nhl hitz  this is a great game to buy
for those of you that are working on a sports collection of games get this one
i have another thing to tell you before we start the review  i will give you info on a game that is coming to xbox soon
the thing
so without further a do lets get dirty
nhl hitz  gives nhl games a diferent point of view
in this game you can pick from any of the teams including the sucky columbus blue jackets
i dont have much more info on it except im getting it 
you can choose from  or  fantasy arena and you can created you own players and teams
i only have the demo but im getting more info as we speak
well have to hold off of the thing until i get more info
after the thing i will talk about bug splating in fusion frenzyim not a big fan of sport games but ive been enjoying this one so far
the action is fast paced and the graphics are great
it takes a while to get use to the controls but you can pick up some skills in the training part of the game which helps you perfect your skillsim not sure what other hockey games are planned for xbox but for a early release this one is worth the priceif youre in the market for a hockey game for your xbox you currently have two choices  blackboxs nhl hitz  and ea sports nhl   the names are confusingly similar but the games couldnt be more differenton the surface the choice is a simple one
if youre not a serious hockey fanbut just want a fast fun gameyoull probably enjoy what blackbox has on offer
if you want a detailed simulation of the actual game international or north american youll doubtlessly choose the latest version ea sports has put outbut if you dig deeper youll realize that neither game has everything you wantgraphically theres really no question which game wins
nhl hitz was created specifically for the xbox and it shows
it fully takes advantage of the system providing all the polygonal joy one could hope forat least for now
it also has a much better spectator engine
the fact that the audience has a grip on whats happening to its home teamcheering booing and even leaving the rink as appropriateenhances the experience of this game noticeably
what really boosts this game though is its fantasy element
rinks arent merely copied from one location to the next with the change of a logo
theres a whole series of unusual match locations like the moon a castle and even an icedover pond
whats more you dont have to play with human players at all
each one of these new locations has a home team of its own ranging from  snowmen to sharks to aliensby contrast nhl  is a mere porting from the pc environment
it doesnt seem to particularly take advantage of the xboxs nvidia chip at all
thats not to say that the graphics arent great
they arefor a pc game
ea just hasnt come up with anything as xbox startling as is found in hitzthis graphical advantage carries through to the matter of incentive play as well
casual players will probably prefer they way hitz gets you to keep playing
each game you win helps you unlock a new rink uniform or species of playeror it adds strength to your custommade teams
the problem is youll eventually unlock everything or create the perfect team
when that happens and its sooner rather than later theres no longer any incentive to keep playing other than your own admiration of the game
nhl  doesnt place the premium on winning so much as improving your skill
for each thing you dobe it winning a face off scoring the first goal or having a certain number of hits in a periodyou win points that you can then apply to buying cards
these cards will then potentially enhance the abilities of a player for a certain length of time
like codes in hitz there are a few of these cards which change certain graphical or gameplay elements of a match
unlike hitz though these cards get increasingly difficult to obtain as you play on
by far the most impressive incentive to continuing to play nhl  though is the same reason you follow real life hockey in the first place  to see a team bob and weave through an entire season survive a playoff and then finally win the stanley cup
while theres a stanley cup feature on hitz its a shadow of the nhl  experience
its not so much a playoff as a goal of beating every other team oncehows game play itself
like all the other elements of the games its a fight between artistic license and faithful reproductionwith hitz you get what you might expect from the title an aggressive style of play jazzed up with a bit of superhero graphical magic
its fast and fluid action that doesnt always have much to do with real life but its so much fun you dont really mind
parents should be aware that usercontrolled fighting with the object being to ko your opponent is a default though optional part of every game and that the game can even award points for successfully beating up opponents
its also way easier to score a goal in hitz than nhl   reason  the games designed that way
much of the secret to scoring is exploiting the onetimer and goalie fatigue
once you figure out how to do this youll be scoring with an almost boring regularity
but the biggest single factor contributing to playing style is the fact that  your team is three players plus a goalie
this more than any other single factor makes hitz an arcade gamenhl  on the other hand is a real simulation
where hitz limits you to six broad attributes  every player in nhl  has at least  different settings each controlling detailed functions  you have a full team divided into changeable lines which can then be coached using real strategies
rulesalmost entirely absent from hitzcan be applied to do everything from simulating an olympic hockey tournament to an american high school match
you can fiddle with the rules to get them to create an environment that doesnt exist but which might
for instance if you like the way olympic hockey is played but want to use your favorite nhl team you can eliminate fighting line passes cut down on icing calls and expand the rink to international proportionsbut otherwise run a normal nhl season
and while you wont see any of your players or the puck suddenly catch on fire as in hitz your players can do more things like skating backwards or deking in a particular directionwith all these differences its easy to see that your choice of hockey game for xbox is going to be a difficult one
neither is best really because neither completely satisfies
maybe with new versions the choice wont be so hard but for the moment i cant recommend anything other than that you get them bothoutside of my old atari tennis paddle pads this is the most comfortable controller ive ever used
the typical complaints  from people are that its heavy its big and the xbox stinksyou can easily disregard the third typical complaint
yes the controller is big but they dont make controllers for  year olds
yes its a tad bit on the heavy size but if youre having trouble picking the controller up please pick some weights up because youre frickin lazy
overall the controller is like everything else for the xbox people who hate it hate microsoft and never owned the xbox
the rest of us lovelike it and do own iti had heard all the hype about the xbox controller and how everyone loved the gamecube controller
so i went into electronics boutique and played halo
i was surprised i like this controller for the most part
its is bulky in the middle but its alot better for me that the gamecube controller which im pretty sure used the dpad from the gameboy advance
i cant imagine trying to pull off moves in dead or alive  with that tiny thing
it must be less than an inch squarewhen i went to walmart the other day i had the chance to feel the xbox controller right there in my hands and it was a lot different from what i had expected it to be
although it was very large much bigger than the dreamcast controller the handles really felt pretty good to your hands and i could imagine playing for a very long time without hand fatigue
the analog sticks are pretty good and i like the dpad on it which is similar to the sidewinder one
the analog triggers are a lot like dreamcast but they gave them a lot more resistance which was a big plus over the dc controller
the only beef i have with this controller is the face buttons the ab etc buttons
they are in a similar layout to the dreamcast controller and all are easy to reach but it would just be hard to press  or  or them at the same time the same problem that the dreamcast had
everything is great except for the face buttons which are a major flaw
but overall its a pretty comfortable controller the analog sticks are great and the trigger buttons are almost as good as the gc onesonly if you have tiny little hands then you probably wont like it but most people can get used to if it they give it a chance
only thing wrong with it is the xyab buttons they are not arranged good but the controller s they are cuz if you are going for y somethins u will hit the clearwhite buttonpersonally i like the xbox controller quite a bit
prior to getting an xbox i read the concerns regarding the size of the controller and found them to not be true in my case
when i first held the controller it did seem large but fit my hands nicelyboth of the analog sticks are nicely positioned and have a good feel to them
the left and right analog triggers are great
they have a long range of motion enabling you to precisely control input
with these the gas pedal of a driving game no longer needs to function like an onoff switchon the downside well is the size
i cant imagine this controller fitting the hands of a child or even a young adult
hopefully aftermarket controllers will be made for those markets
also the black and white buttons on the upper right of the controller are a bit difficult to reach
fortunately the games ive come across dont rely on them for critical gameplaythis is a good controller but a big one
i have to get used to it again
but besides that a good onethe xbox controller is big bulky and it takes getting used to
i have big hands so its pretty comfortable for me but i would not reccomend this controller for little kidsthe controller is a high quality product and was built with the input of hundreds of gamers
the button placement is adequate but people with smaller hands will find themselves stretching to reach some of the buttonsthis is the default controller that comes with the xbox system and is not by any means a bad controller
buti would reccomend the xbox controller s which is great for smaller hands and big hands
its also made by microsoft so you can expect a quality producti was at a local eb and they had an xbox kiosk with fusion frenzy so i played
at first i thought the controller was too big but after about  minutes i forgot about it
it was very comfortable and my hands arent that big
the white and black buttons take a little more effort to reach but it was never a real problem
the triggers are awesome
they have  levels of sensitivity which is sweet for racing games
if the size really concerns you then wait till the japanese controller is released in the us and buy iteveryone seems to complain about these controllers being difficult to use i can see that being true if a person is younger than  i am  and my hands perfectly fit it
oddly enough because it only fits in the hands of older people it is very durable and heavy
so it cannot bend or break easily
as for the controller itself it has six buttons red blue yellow green black and white along with two very unique triggers
rather than an l  r button at the top of the controller which wear out easy these triggers are spring loaded so they should last very long
there are two ports for additional memory cards but with the xbox having a huge memory you should never need a memory card
there are two analog sticks at the top let and bottom right of the controller for shooting games
it also has a normal directional pad at the bottom left for very accurate control
it comes with a rumble function and it works by a usb port and for those of you that are not computer nerds that means that plug it into the xbox and its self powered so you do not need batteries for the rumble functionthe xbox controller is very big but surpirsingly comfertable
i had no problem holding this thing and useing it to play games like dead or alive  and halo im  by the way
i dont know why people are complaining that this thing is the worste thing to happen to a game controller but i think most people have already forgotten about the nintendo  controller
the reason i took away a star is because i cant really see kids playing games with this thing and not having a problem
other then that this is a solid controlleri really like this controller
unless you are a preteen or have unusually small hands this controller is comfortable and ergonomically designed
i like the slightly different button arrangement than the scontroller or ps diamond layout
the problem with this controller is that  there are too many gamers that are used to the ps controller  there are plenty of children that play video game consoles and  third party xbox controllers such as mad catz and the new scontroller use the diamond button configuration
the button configurations are different enough that you can get messed up switching between the twoi think more and more people will migrate to the scontroller or other third party controllers and that this controller style will slowly fade out
unless you have tried these and really like them better than the others and this happens to be the case for me you should consider the scontrolleras long as your hands are big enough for the controller which most of my friends and my hands are the original controller is actually better than the new s controller
about the only good thing that thet s controller has is rearranged a b x and y buttons but the other repositioning is very very bad
the start and back buttons and the black and white buttons are right underneath your hands when you are gripping the controller very awkward to have to bring your thumb back that far when you are trying to play a gamethe xbox memory unit is a simple useful and if you ever plan on transferring data from one xbox to another essential item
plugged into one of the two available slots on an xbox controller the memory unit allows you to transfer saved files from one xbox to another
there are limitations ability to transfer music is nonexistent in my experience and while it could transfer xbox live profiles that doesnt mean much anymore does itwhen you go to your xboxs dashboard with its green simplicity that one can miss so much in the complicated days of the  one listed feature allows you to access memory of games you have played
sometimes game settings characters profiles and such are listed separately sometimes not
it varies from one game to another
but whatever is available you can save that onto the memory card and add it to the memory of another xboxive found the xbox memory unit to be useful and it actually looks pretty good in my book
there are two categories of accessories and games when it comes to an aging lastgeneration console like the xbox
one is the rare and expensive the other is the frequently available and cheap
the xbox memory unit thankfully falls into the second category averaging  excluding shipping last i checked
it isnt the newest most happening thing out there in the video game world anymore
but it is inexpensive and good at what it does
i recommend itsince the xbox unit has a builtin hard drive for saving games and music if you like one may assume that one will never require a memory card an essntial for the ps and gamecube
but if one packs too much info onto the hard drive then load times on most games increases which i have discovered to my regret and games which use the hard drive to preload levels such as halo take even longer
the solution
use a memory card to save games and thus save wear and tear on your hard drive
sure the drive is durable but id rather use a  card than risk damage or wear on a critical xbox component
the card does have a few drawbacks though
for one it will not transfer music files it wouldnt hold many anyway and it will only allow the transfer of character profiles and not saved games which i discovered when trying it with a friends halo saves
ive also found it to be useful when downloading the pitifully few codescheats available for the xbox system though try not to put saves and codes on the same card corruption of the saved games is always a danger when doing this
but the benefits of this unit seem to outweigh its drawbacks and so i recommend it
i do not however recommend any of the offbrand cards available for the xbox
my experiences as both a consumer and a retailer have taught me that the xbox brand card is by far the besti dont know anyone who has an xbox i dont store anything on it i dont customize plays or anything so why exactly did i buy it
well i guess i can still use it some day
i have the capability but not the need
there are better things i could have spent my cash on for my xbox but i chose this as an option
added capability is always a good thing though
better to have it and not need it than need it and not have itok technically you dont need a memory unit thanks to the xboxs hard drive but there is one reason why having one is a very good idea backup
if you xbox hard drive decides to call it quits all of your saved games will likely go with it
if youre into long games such as morrowind that is a large time investment down the drain
spend the cash and keep  copies of your most important savesi bought it to transfer the save games to another xboxthe game in question is knights of the old republic which is a very good game if you have a lot of spare timethe memory module holds around  units which is plenty for most games
kotors save games are  units
which it seems to translate to m
so keep an eye on the memory usage on your xbox to make sure the game you want to move or save will fit megs might not seem like a lot but i was able to fit all my grand theft auto  vice city  thief max payne medal of honour ghost reconfifa  and euro  games no prob
the reason i did this was that my x box laser for some reason stopped picking up the games on time resulting in many games cutting off and a quotdisc is dirty or damagedquot message
i couldnt bear playing gtavc for weeks to get where i was so i bought the card booted my saved games then traded my x box in
when i got the new box the games transferred without fail i was very satisfied
so if any of you all are experiencing problems like above and your x box is still under warranty you might want to try thatwell my dvdvcr combo gave up the ghost
it was almost  years old anyways
also my upstairs dvd player went dead on me about the same time
i had bought it used many moons ago when dvd players where still going for 
i dont really play video games now that im  then it hit me my old xbox works as a dvd player and surprisingly i still remembered you needed this
their was a reason this remote was needed
microsoft was trying to recoup some money on offering dvd playback in its console
for fear off people not wanting to buy the xbox because it lacked this feature they came up with this scheme
at the time dvd players where still going for about  for a cheap one
the kit at the time was  so microsoft made about a  profit on this
of course it was either that or buying a dvd player for 
anyways thankfully you can get this now for under 
as i dont watch many movies as well it will do a job
also i do have another dvd player as well as my main unitwhile i dont see the quotneedquot for this to play dvd movies other than to line microsofts pockets its a nice package with a nice remote and unlike the problems everyone had with sony ps remotes  this one works
athough ill be throwing it in a drawer once my universal is programmed for this
i cant say im surprised though to have to pay extra for this builtin albeit latent feature from microsoftone of the better features offered on the xbox system is its ability to play dvds as well as games an attribute shared by the playstation  but not the gamecube
this handy little kit makes dvd playback a snap
all one has to do is pop the sensor unit in to one of the controller ports port one seems to work best and fire up the remote
the remotes design is userfriendly with big buttons and an ergonomic design that fits nicely into ones hand
among the features offered on the xbox accessed by pressing the display button are x magnification subtitles and audio selectionbut the remote has a downside as well
its range is a little limited go too far to the left or right of the sensor and functionality becomes a little spotty and it lacks a power or eject button
plus it requires you use the display button to access too many functionsthis can be a bit of a hassle as many other dvd players offer remotes with these functions already available through a single button
it also plays region one dvds only so dvds from europe or other regions wont play
then theres the matter of the additional wear and tear dvd playback has on the xbox unit itself
if you play a lot of games and watch a lot of dvds you may end up shortening the life of your xbox system
with dvd players going for as little as forty to fifty dollars these days it may be wiser to just buy a separate dvd player
but if you want to utilize the dvd functions of the xbox system then this little package will serve the purpose wellwhen you need all  controller slots for multiplayer be sure to remember where you left the lettile reviever because it is easily lost
i have not used an actual dvd plaer but im sure you can do everything with this which you can with an actualy player
too bad you cannot turn on the xbox with the remote but america is fat as it is so some second exercize wont kill you
the picture quality is way better than a vhs so if you have an xbox you should really get this unlesss you allready have a dvd playerinitially i was a little bummed that the xbox didnt come ready to play dvd out of the box
so when i was able to pick one of these up for  i decided to give it a shot
i was not disappointedthe dvd playback is nice and the remote although it looks small is very powerful and is laid out flawlesslyall in all im very impressedits simple if you have an xbox you might as well get the dvd playback kitpros the xbox is cooler than my jvc dvd players
the xbox takes up less room than my jvc and xbox together
the kit works with my rca controller so im happy
really clean picture
the xbox is semiportable so you can watch dvds at friends housescons this whole thing is a feature that should really have been included with the xbox
no eject or power buttons which drives me freaking nutsbottom line buy it for petes sake
theres even a mail in rebate from time to time that makes the thing free if you buy an xbox between certain datesoh yeah you might just want to use the plug in part and program your tvs universal remote using rcas codesive enjoyed my xbox dvd player
it is relatively easy to use and functional
i have found it more convenient than my original dvd playerhowever there are two down sides the round button at the top that looks like a power button it isnt
i find myself pressing it at the end of almost every movie but it is a display button to bring up machine settings like sound and segment repeatthere is no volume control so you have to wrestle with an extra remote
i dont mind because i already pipe mine through an external stereo system but if you like to be able to use only one remote this isnt the dvd player for youhow this works is there is a little adapter which plugs into any of the controller ports like an xbox controller then put two aaa batteries into the remote
beware because remember the xbox is more like a computer and less like a dvd player
why do you need to know that
dvd players can play any dvd but computers only play dvds with the country code of 
 is the country code for the dvd which means that it was made for north american dvd players
so look at the back of your dvd cases down near the bottom where it says dolby digital look for a giant 
that means the xbox can play it
pretty much all dvds come with the  but some popular dvds like gladiator and the simpsons boxed set do not have the i was very disappointed when i found out that my xbox did not play dvds fresh out of the box
the growing trend of selling a system in pieces rather than shipping a complete system is one that im not very fond of
as much as these game systems cost they should have everything you need right in the boxwhile i loathed doing so i eventually bought the dvd playback kit because i was going on a trip and wanted to be able to play movies and games during my down time
as it turns out i like the xbox so much as a dvd player that i now use it as my primary dvd player
my previous dvd player was an older model jvc and ive had tons of problems with it
it wont play some dvds and ive had to take it to be repaired three times twice in the first year i owned iti think the compaints in amazons review are valid
the lack of an eject button or power button on the remote makes it less convenient but i have to get up to change dvds anyway so i dont find that much of a bother
i find the inmovie menu easy to use and an improvement over my jvc which basically makes me do the same thign when i want to change subtitles or lanuages
my biggest problem with the xbox and not as big as it may sound for some reason it wont read some disks when you first put them it
this is easily cured by turning the system on and the off again and its only certain disks donnie darko was one shreck was another but i was concerned when it wouldnt read the disk and a bit irritatedthe main reson i replaced my jvc with my xbox is that i think the picture is better and clearer
with the hdtv cables hooked up the picture quality on my sony wega is crystal clear
good transfer dvds like star wars tpm look absolutely incredible
i was really surprised at some of the cool highend features like the ability to zoom
i cant find any documentation to prove that the xbox is a progressive scan dvd player but i do know that when you attach the hdtv cables you are given several options for progressive scan viewing in the video section
my tv is not hdtv compatible although it has component hookups and i could not play the dvds with any of those settings
even though i havent read anything about it it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a progressive scan dvd player with hdtv compatibilitywhile i dont think the sound is any better than my old dvd player its just as good whether playing dolby surround dolby digital  or dtswhile i was originally outrgaed at having to buy the ability to do something that i think the system should already be doing and still do i do feel like i got my moneys worth
the xbox dvd playback far surpasses the other dvd playing game systems and even most mid to low end dvd players
the reviewers that have said they preferred the ps dvd playback boggle my mind
they either dont own an xbox with the full getup or are loyal ps owners and want it to be true
i own a ps and its far inferior when playing dvds
not even in the same league in this particular category
the xbox is still the best deal on the market and is only going to get betterhave to have it to play dvds on your xboxthanks for that microsoft
but it does work well
i never had issue with the range and all the buttons worked fine
its about everything you could expect from a runofthemill remote controla must have for xbox ownersbadno eject button and have to get too close to the unit in order for the dvd controller to workthis is an item ive read lots of mixed reviews about but after taking the plunge im surprised that ive had my xbox this long without this little piece of hardware
while it is true and a legitimate concern that microsoft chose not to include power or eject funtions on the remote hence the  out of  rating the remote is extremely easy to use and wellcontoured to your hands
the buttons are of good quality with excellent spring and good general layout
the onscreen menus and display text are sharp and clear and include topoftheline dvd player features like ab repeat zoom and a killer advancerewind feature of many speeds from xx
plus it also works as a cd and soundtrack feature remote if you plan on using you xbox to play music
totally worth the moneyas far as remotes go this one could have been better
when youre holding the remote the thing falls into your hand so that youre holding it near the back
this makes everything at and below the select button very accessable but you kinda have to reach for the important buttons
no biggie its just a little weird
a power button would have been a good idea and for some reason i want an eject button to
dont know whyon a side note itll be interesting to see if al those people who complained about having to buy a dvd remote for the xbox will whine about having to buy a modembroadband adaptor for the psthis remote control is a very nice product
we bought it for my brotherinlaw for christmas and used it that day
it works very nicely
never did we have trouble with the infrared signal and you can do most of the normal things you can do with any dvd player ie fastforward rewind access the menu etc
overall this is a nice product for the price
nowhere else can you buy a dvd player for this price
assuming of course you already have the xboxas a dvd player the xbox is great
this controller is full of surprises
its comfortable and easy to usei eventually broke down and got a real dvd player even though i already had thisthe xbox would not play my lord of the rings the two towers extended edition dvd
it would play on my computer and it plays on my new dvd player but it would not play on my xbox
ive also had some problems with dvds skippingstuttering that i havent had on my new dedicated dvd playeri think its just that the dvd drive the xbox uses is cheap so you might run into some problemsif you really want to watch a lot of movies i suggest getting a seperate player that was built with dvd viewing in mind
however the xbox will play  of dvds just fine so for this price you wouldnt be amiss to have this for a multitv family where the parents want to watch gone with the wind and the kids would rather watch pretty much anything on the other tvif youre just hoping this will save you some cash dont say i didnt warn you
now and then you might find you rented a movie that your xbox has problems with but a real dvd player wouldnti do not know why this is coming up as a game review when this is a review for the xbox dvd movie playback kit
anyways i bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it
it works like a charmwhat a cute game
if you dont know its a sim game based on creating a zoo that inhabitable for animals and fun for adults
its a little more realistic than the usual park games and not so tedious eitherfirst the good  the graphics arent too bad  theyre just not like quake
the animals are very cute and when they have babies theyre just adorable
you have a number of additions to your zoo to decorate and entertain your audience
speaking of guests thats probably one of the better points of the game
in playing simrollercoaster i got very sick of how repetitious it was to send guards after delinquents almost every  minutes meaning it was just expected after awhile and got very boring
here the guests act more like guests
you dont have mass riots break out unless an animal escapes obviously and the most of you have to worry about is bathrooms and food stands
once thats in place its easier to concentrate on your exhibits rather than the fact that guest  is pissed because there isnt any drink stand within  feet of him although theres one  feet away
this isnt the case at all
the guests roam around take photos and buy stuff without vomiting or getting angry like the system tells it to
its a little more realistic and fun to playon the program itself i was very surprised how well it loaded and how fast
first thing it did was scan my system quickly to make sure i was compatible
usually with games i have to run some type of diagnostic within the game disc but this was different
also it loaded within  seconds
most of the time the games i buy take a full minute such as the sims or american mcgees alice which takes a minutes inbetween boards  i barely have time to grab a drink before it says what do you want to dothe downsides would be some of the glitches
very few mind you but they can be annoying
i find that the keepers have a hard time walking  period
they sometimes walk in place for a second and my exhibits fill up with poo that they neglect to clean up right away
but im expecting a patch which im sure theyll put out sometime soon
otherwise it runs just fine
makes sense though if you think about it heres a software company putting out a game that is directly compatible with their platform
who better to put out a game than a programming companyall in all cute game
very much an artsy type of sim game where the player concentrates on the look and management of the park rather than the rides
pretty funi originally bought zoo tycoon for my wife who tends not to branch out much in variety of computer games
cards and hidden item puzzles are more her thing but i thought that caring for cute animals might appeal to the motherly instinct
in her case that didnt pan out
however i liked the game myself having been a roller coaster tycoon player a few years back making zoos turn a profit was right down my alleyzoo tycoon is a fun game of that type
it played out for me after only a few days but for the rock bottom price i got it for even then something like  in the bargain bin at best buy that few days worth of play more than covered the priceas my title suggested watch your bears
i had two male polar bears and one female in an enclosure and all of a sudden one of the male bears whacked the other across the noggin and i had two polar bears and a pile of polar bear meat
also make sure that you build a double gated entrance for your cleaners and feeders to go through or youll have plenty of animals wandering your walkways right along with the paying customers
figuring out what types of animals can go into one enclosure together is a key to success
it saves on building expense and cleaning and feeding time and you get more animals on display per acre
i even had bears and beaver in the same enclosure but i made sure to give the beaver a little island to retreat to if neededrecommended especially at current pricespeople who love rct should really get into this game altho it does come off as a ripoff of the rct style and enginewho cares makes it easier to play
the one thing myself and my friends did notice right away when playingthis game can be hard
there is a lot of things you need to concentrate on all at once and learning the types of foliage and terrains and the likesdislikes of the many animals is more difficult than a basic knowledge of rollercoasters and gocarts to mehowever it does take the experience of running a theme park like rct to do well in this game
you are responsible for budgets marketing inpark revenue souveigners food etc
 and staff
adjusting prices adjusting attractions shows and so forthone thing that is great about this game i know everyone wished rct had this is the freestyle version
aside from playing several challenge scenerios you can also start with a blank piece of land with terrain and budget of your choosing
and have fun
there are also plenty of free download addins for this game onlineonce you get a handle on this game you will instantly get hooked and love itit just takes a little patience at first
but sooner or later youll be breeding lions just to sell them so you can open a new icecream cartthis game is fun but the reason why i put  starsis because sometimes the guests can be mad and leave the areabut still its fun
enjoy amazoncomwell i own and love rollercoaster tycoon and i just couldnt get enough of it the first month that i owned it
it was just so much fun
the game was so new so cool so free that it sold like crazy
well since then weve seen the birth of dozens of other games like that including mall tycoon train tycoon airport tycoon monopoly tycoon etceven a sequel to the classic roller coaster tycoon rollercoaster tycoon 
yet most of those were okay but didnt capture half of the magic that the first did
but this one i have to admit came extremely close
how
gameplay i loved the theme of the game
you start out with several thousand dollars
with that cash you pick a piece of land youd like to own
an island a desert an ice peak etc  once youve selected your park you are sent there to create a zoo
no help no anything
you are on your own
so you decide to buy an animal
what should you buy
you can buy just about anything from elaphants bears hippos cheetahs ostriges lions seals polar bears buffalo etcits incredibel
now you have to make these animals happy or else theyll just sit in a corner and eventually die
the guests dont want to see that
so you have to build animals large areas to play in and friends to play with you have to add african savana for elaphants trees for goriallas or monkeys water for any animal to drink out ofyou must also build these habitats in a way that your guests can see the animals
meaning no trees blocking the viewing area unless you built the path all the way around so they can see
you must let your guests get the best view possible or else you will fail in your quest to become a great zoo
graphics incredible
a lot of people might think that you put an animal in and it just sits there
wrong
its the complete oppostite
the animals run around play with each other
the seals swim the polar bears have growling fights
the animals lap water you can keep track of your animals happiness and such like roller coaster tycoon
and they all have waste that you have to clean up
for this you hire trainers who do everything the animals need
its cool to watch an animal sick lying on its back
the trainer goes in lies by its side giving it medicine then stands up and watches the animal get back up
this games graphics were awsome
not to mention the occasional humor
can anyone say high santa clause
this xmas sometimes witches or santa or planes fly over the zoo with jingling bells or weird cries
ho ho ho merry chistmas
options a lot
you can name all of your pets watch as they have offspring and name them
build paths food establishments water holes etc  you hire more employees when you have more animals
you must also think in this or compromise to fit as many animals as possible in the place
some animals get along some dont
and if one gets loose because of a faulty fencenever put a low wooden fence around an animal like an elaphant buffalo lion cheetah
if they break loose your zoo will be in a mania
its kind of fun to save and try this every once and awhile very funmahaha
overall this game had most of what the original had
but now its in a zoo
not to mention once you get bored if ever this happens there are at least  or  expansion packs
can you say jurassic zoo dinosaur expansion pack or waterpark melee aqua expansion pack
i love tycoon and u should 
dont miss out on all the fun this game is fun great and though a little strechted huge places for eating that in my opinion look like farmhouses this game is a blast
a mustownthxbasically rollercoaster tycoon is the best sim game ever
zoo tycoon is a great sim yet differentwhile rollercoaster tycoon is somewhat quickpaced zoo tycoon takes patience
screaming rollercoasters arent quite the same as keeping quiet pandas happy
however despite the slow pace zoo tycoon can keep you glued to the screen for hoursmy favorite mode is free mode where you simply design a zoo with a given amount of money
implementing your zoo scenery and landscaping with your exhibits is an interesting and difficult taskthere are over  animals tons of exhibit foliage fences and toys as well as three different staff members to hire
the result
a game big enough to keep you entertained
if you enjoyed rollercoaster tycoon this is worth a shot
if you loved rct buy this nowin zoo tycoon you get to run your own zoo
im sure you could have guessed that
you set up animal exhibits roadpaths in your zoo and tourist facilities
when you set up the animal exhibits the creatures you put in those cages are really picky
some want this while others want that and it is difficult to please all the animals in a single exhibit
they usually agree better if theyre the same species of animal
this game is fun for the first few hours but soon gets boring
i suggest playing a demo of this game before purchasei liked this game very much
it wasnt to challenging but not to easy either
good graphics considering the fact that it was a cartoon
its also really fun for a party or just a few friends
the characters are really funny and they each have their own special weapon sinder is my favorite
so this game is definitely worth your money but i do suggest you rent it first just in case you dont think like i doto make this short and sweet for youcell damage was an xbox launch game and was an exclusive for quiet some time
it showed some really impressive cell shading
but hey if this was the first cell shaded i prolly would have givin it a  for its originality
the game is pretty funthe graphics are just awesome and deserves a star for thatgameplay is really fun but gets a lil old later but still goodsound is greatblahthis game is great and i really cant say much about it except that it is greatduhi just said thatsome reviews i give a short and sweet meaning i just wanna make this short and some of my reviews youll see is pretty damn short
i cant say much about this game and that is why its gonna be shortwell from excellent visuals to some great gameplay and good sound i guess i just had to give it a out of  starsand there you have it ladies and gentslatesif youre looking for a game as unique as the xbox itself this is it
 human players compete in a variety of demolition derby matches with a graphic style straight out of that roger rabbit movie
amazing vehicles characters weapons and arenas make this a highly addictive party game
lots of quotable lines too
the action is so fast and furious that itll take a few plays to catch upsimpsons road rage is about how mr burns buys springfield transit services and replaces the buses with nuclear power so to save springfield you must start your own taxi service drive people where they want to go make money to buy transit services back and avoid running out of time during your moneymaking excursions
the games overall quality is decent but unfortunately there are issues that must be addressed
first off the graphics
the characters dont really look like cartoons rather ugly character models that didnt take full use of the consoles power
next is repetition
sometimes the game gets repetitive during taxi missions and the environments are somewhat bland
next is the destruction
seriously ea the destruction in the game isnt very impressive
this game has some overall good value to it if you dont have anything new to play when it comes to driving or youre just bored waiting for new cooler titles
or if you youre a rabid simpsons fan this is definitely worth a look
i had a good enough time with it but it lacks depth and meat to itthis game is fun
will you learn anything or be moved to tears by the storyline
no
its funits fun to hear what each character says in response to each event that happensjust like playing quotcrazy taxiquotrent it
if you like it buy it
you can replay it over and over againa fun driving game where there is no winner or loser
its not very competitive at all there are no levels therefore it is virtually impossible to get stuck
a great game overalli cant believe this game gets so much heat for ripping off crazy taxi
so what
crazy taxi was a great game and the simpsons  road rage is even better
any simpsons fan will definetly love the tie ins with the show
you can go all around springfield driving various simpsons characters that say hilarious things the leprechan told me to burn things  ralph get out of the way jerk  homer
you can choose from over a dozen characters including the simpson family apu ned and many more
the story mode is also challenging having the player complete different tasks not just taxi driving
the multiplayer mode i play all the time with my friends
you have to compete with other players in order to get customers and make money
dont listen to the critics
simpsons fan or not you will love this game
plus its a bargin at the greatest hits price of only 
go buy itthis game rocks if you are a simpsons fan
if not dont buy it
you can unlock a ton of cars and the voices help the gameplay since they are the real actors
graphics dont do the xbox justice but hey its all about having fun
which this game supplies plenty ofsimpsons rr is a awsome game at first
all the realvoices colorful staying with the story plot
but itis a little  easy the car physics are good
myfavorite part is when you stop the hand at the topturns and you make a wicked spin
there are verryfunny lines like lisa simpson will you marry meall in all a good gamethis is certainly a fun game
however i am a little disappointed at the graphics
by that i mean in comparision to the graphics on the nfl fever yes i know it is not the same sport in is a big dropoff
from all i have seen and read about xbox i guess this is becuase ea doesnt create games for the xbox specifically
i wish they would because with their game play and the graphic potential of the xbox we could have one great nhl gameas for owning it currently its the best out there
i played hitz which is more for younger players who only like certain aspects of the hockey
in this you can really play the game like you would play a football game that is with stragtegythough segas nhl k will not be available on xbox until late early  i think it may be worth waiting for
segas nhl k for dreamcast easily bested eas nhl  in terms of gameplay
eas game is not as fluid or intense as segas effort and i would go with a waitandsee attitude unless you are dieing for an xbox hockey title today
somewhat recommended  a good game but youd be better off waiting for segas nhl k to surface on xboxim not really that much of a basketball fan but nba live  is a very exciting game
great graphics and just pure fun make this game a bball fans mustquotnirvana rulesquotif you have played the  and  versions of nba live and played this version you will find that they are pretty much the same
especially the  players all look pretty much the same and there are not any new moves at all
nba live  made some improvement but some of the ai is not tolerable
this game has great ai and great game play with alot of flashy dunks
sure some of the guys faces doesnt look as good as the  or  and sure michael jordan still plays in this game and yeh nba live  has that option where you can choose your favorite team and their colors and players will be showing int he menu but so what
arent these sport games all about gameplay
petty features should be ignored and we should not encourage ea to make a sport game every year if the roster is the only thing to be changed
this is definitely a cheaper but more worth your money nba livegameplaysound graphics replay value overall first things first this game was a blast with excellent gameplay options and overall depth
heres what i thought of the xbox version of nba live  by ea sports gameplay excellent in almost every way
unlike in the older versions now when you play a good team like the lakers its a lot more difficult to win then when you play someone like the bulls
ive played a season so far in franchise mode and i have to admit it was very addicting
anyone remember playing the old versions of live and finding it so easy on the hardest mode to go  to begin a season
not the case here
after probably  hours or more of gameplay i still lose  or  out of every  games
and in the big games playoffs or against a team like the mavs lakers kinds etcyou really feel the pressure to win
the ai plays smart the players and bench react and the crowd cheers with you on big plays suddenly goes mute when the other team goes on a run
the reason i love this game nba lives gameplay rocks anything weve seen so farthe graphics very good but not superb
its really cool to see a pointer swish threw the net once then rattle around and go in the next
the ball goes in or out different ways now
example in past versions the ball would just clank off the rim or swish if it went in
no other animation
now i never know if its going to go in or out and it rattles around a different way every time
the dunks in this game are simply put awsome
you never see the same dunk twice and the twists and spins are incredible to watch
the players as well now look great
you can now clearly tell the difference between big ole shaq and a much smaller kobe bryant
the graphics bring this game to life
where the graphics fail you may ask
there isnt any differnce between one pass or steal and another
no behind the back no diving for lose balls no jaw dropping blocks
it gets the job done but nothing else
i guess were just spoiled in todays time but parts of the game are just too simple
options once again very good but not great
you can do the usual  on  exibition season franchise  on   theres still create a player
but unlike in nba k you cant do anything but  on   no  on   on   in streetball only one court
in franchise mode this really killed me no fantasy draft
ahhhhhhhh
i used to love that and it always seemed to create a new challenge
but for some reason no fantasy draft in the  version
why
who knows
oh one more thing no real cash
its a points system
if you want to resign your star you offer him what points
just make it regular cash like everybody else
i hate the points systemoverall though this game rocked
i have probably played it for close to  hours and i still cant put it down
if you want a good basketball game with the best graphics gameplay and overall realism of the nba
nba live  is for youthxnba live  is a great game
with sick dunks that willmake your head spin awsome layups and good play by playactioni got an idea that might help you on your seasonwhen you start a season and you get to the season settingsput trade resrictions off and you can bring the bulls orwhoever you want back from the deadfun fun funi think nba live  is the best basketball game ever
the game play is very smoothplayers look very realisticand all players have their respected shoesbut this games does have some faultsplayers get offensive rebounds very easilyautomatic keep the score close features  leaving no room to keep a comfortable leaveeasy to score in the paint even the sorry players can score double digits if they get the ball in the paintbut this game is a must have for all nba live fansarctic thunder is an arcade game plain and simple
it can be a lot of fun if you are playing with  or  others
aim for the green turbo icons at all costs or you probably will never win
it is a blast when you hit these because your snowmobile takes off like a rocketgameplay easy controls fun multiplayer and stuff to unlockgraphics it is arcadestyle all the way so they are not that bad when you consider that
could have been betterreplay very fun when playing with others and can be fun for a single player if you are into unlocking stuff
will bore you after you have completed everythingoverall i would love to give this one  stars but since i cannot i chose to round up because of the multiplayer funi know im a bit late but im in love
generally speaking im a sucker for anything that has experience points incorporated into the gameplay but my enjoyment of this game goes far beyond that
the plot is a bit predictable at times and the musicsound effects make me turn the volume off sometimes but the graphics are lush and the gameplay really worksthis is what the junction and gf systems in ffviii should have been
a large part of the gameplay hinges on djinns or elemental spirits which you must collect as you progress through the game
once you collect a djinn you must set it to a character think of it as junctioning
this will affect what sort of special abilities the character has the characters stats their class and of course what they get to summon in battlethe most interesting thing about the djinns is the fact that you can combine different elemental djinns on one person to produce some interesting special abilities
admittedly some djinns do not do this when in certain combinations but the idea is simply fascinating and opens up a very interesting avenue in character developmentanyway the upshot of this is if you are an rpg fan with a gba you need this gamefans of squaresoft rpgs chrono trigger especially will love this game and even those who are not big on rpgs will get a kick out of it
it is an actionbased rpg with a battle and magic systems very similar to that of secret of mana chrono trigger and the various final fantasy gameshere are the pros the graphics and sound make you understand the true power of this little system
the fights are fast paced and characters are colorful and well animated
the music is classic rpg material similar to the squaresoft games
the story albeit cliched by rpg standards is engrossing and will require a lot of reading and attention
this is a major plus because the time flies by as you are playing so a long bus ride or flight wont seem so long when you are playing thishere are the cons there are very few
but the one problem that i often experience is that the hours of gameplay required takes its toll on your batteries
as well though quotgolden sunquot can be considered goundbreaking by handheld standards the story gives the player a real dejavu feeling
a more fresh and original storyline would have helped
but a standard rpg story is always engrossing you just sometimes get that quotbeen there done thatquot feelingquotgolden sunquot is a game for the more intellegent and attentative gamer and a great way to pass time on the road
you will be impressed by the graphics and sound but youll stay for the fun and adventureive played some of the great titles in rpg history  final fantasy  xenogears chrono trigger lunar  and  star ocean  along with many others
this game definately is up there as one of the more well made rpgs
with an amazing battle system that pushes the limits of the gba this games graphics quality is amazing
its music is well done could be better but overall not bad
the character designs are well done and the world design is pretty darn straight forward
the only problem with golden sun is that it has no character development the characters pretty much just fall into your lap with little development or setup for who the characters really are other than just another addition to your team
one other minor problem is that golden sun is set up to be a trilogy if you want a game with a straight beginning middle end dont buy this game however if youre looking to the setup of what could be an amazing epic adventure than this rpg is definately for youill make this short
its like final fantasy only better generic no
im not a real fan of fantasysetting rpgs but ive made my exception
getting a gba
are you a rpg junkie
look no more
my only complaint is that the battle system is a lot like final fantasy two sides you and the enemy your characters just stand there until its their turn to fight
yea they juststand theregolden sun was a nice surprise after i got a few hours into it
it really turned out to be a solid and well made rpghowever the intro is slow and i do mean slowthe introduction is almost an hour long of continuous dialogueim knocking off half a star due to the beginning and the rest of the games tedious dialogue
there is a ton of reading to be done in this game and none of it is worthy of a novelanother bad part of this game is how easy it is
i went through the entire game without using one healing item like potions and such
the synergys and pokemon are way too strong and get you through every battle without a sweatstill this game was lots of fun and had many unique puzzles and situations thanks to its psynergy system
so if youre in need of a fun well made and lengthy portable rpg than you dont have to look any further than golden sunthis game is pretty fun to play in between classes and during my astronomy lectures
it has really good graphics and spells for a game boythe story seems to be overused and predictable
and the dialogue is too long for such a linear game
my favorite rpgs are planescape torment fallout  and arcanum for the computer
these have lots of dialogue but there are tons of choices to define your character and stuff
this is just too linear to make us press b for all of the text
and the yes and no in the text is pretty pointless too
it all leads to the samethingmonster encounters happen to often imho and it can get really difficult
but all in all it is a pretty good game for gbafinaly passed the game within a month since i started totaling about  hours of gameplay for me
had to use some hints along the way to figure out some of the puzzles so it wasnt too bad
the puzzles werent too hard to figure out since if you mess up you can always walk out of a room and the puzzle resets
there are however a few puzzles that require backtracking several screens making you wonder what the clickslevers were for but mostly it isnt something that would stop you in your tracks in playing the gamethe sound is realy bad very repetitive with perhaps  tracks that plays for the entire lenght of the game
however since it is a gba game then its onpare with the other gba games
the sound however isnt something that would keep you from playing this old classic that must be very cheap by nowthe game play utilizes the old style rpg gameplay where you attack in a turn based mode
however they added a few more options to this style by adding special djinn that you can use to boost your stats or use them directly as a summon
then the melee fight was augmented with the additions of weapons that uses magic the way a caster would
this adds a degree of magic to your boring brutes that you use at the front lines giving them a new dememsion
golden sun took what is traditional and added a few features to it to keep it interesting but dont look for anything radical
the standard old school rpg is very presentthe linear gameplay is apparent from the start and doesnt change much as you go on
fortunately toward the middle you are allowed to backtrack and go to old regions if you wish to finish all the corners of a dungeon that you left behind for all the rare itemsi enjoyed this game from start to finish
graphics is nothing new and sound isnt much to look for but if you know what youre getting into then golden sun can only please you more with their gameplay
i would recomend all rpg fans to pick this one up especialy if they didnt play the second part yet since the characters can be reused with stats and alli will start right off and say a great and will be classic game for gba
its deffinatly not what it could have been and though i havent played the jap version there is no heavy and dark conversations or exchanges and it sounds like he hasnt played the american version
anyways golden sun is very good for the money but the story is right out of rpg class  in other words very basic very stay inside the lines
can be confusing at times puzzle wise
pros  good old fashiond rpg
visually awesome the graphics kick tail
very final fantasy sevenish combat wise
save anywhere
strategiclly awesome
good magic game
cons  very basic and at times boring rpg
you do get stuck
very hard to find the four wild djinn  the last for djinn you find in the wild once you go forward its hard to go back and do things
very run of the mill dont stray off the beaten path keep right on going with one quest at a time gameall in all fun and exileratingif you have played any final fanasy game and you liked it you will like this
the best gameboy adv
game ever
it has very good graphics and the story is awsome
you need this gameif you buy it and like it then by the sequal to it golden sun  the lost age
coming out april i hope this helped your suggestion to buy this game
tust me its awsomegolden sun is what i would call a good starting rpg for gba
okay there might not be alot out there if at all by now but golden sun should be one title to buy if you are an rpg fan
it has the standard complement of four characters in your party
of course you can customize your characters professions depending on the type of psynergy you equip them with
you also find a whole slew of special items and weapons in the game thatll help you in your quest
storywise its a pretty average tale
young hero sets off to right wrongs
no big deal but its not a boring tale so itll keep you entertained
graphicswise its one of the better looking games out there
the summons are done pretty well for an advance game although like the ff games i got tired of doing summons and opted for just the regular critical atacks
one word though is that the game wont seem complete as you only really finish half of your mission
supposedly therell be a  second part soon
but dont let that stop you from buying this game as it easily takes about  hours to complete
a far cry from some on the newer more quotgood lookingquot games that only last  hours at most
buy it
youll like it and really have time to enjoy itthe graphics on this game are simply great
the story is also very fun and the controls are easy to figure out
even though many say that this is right out of a book or magazine i love the game
i fell in love with it when my brothers friend let me borrow it for a while and it convinced me to buy it
this is a fun game for people of all ages
it reminds me of final fantasy in a way but it may be just me
why only  stars if i like it so much
i only give things i am crazy about  stars
anyway i recommend you playing this game before you get it simply because certain people may not like the style of the game
however i loved it so i suggest just playing it to test it outpros great sound and graphics interesting storyline fun to docons hard to figure out at firstthis makes a great gift and is a great addition to anyones game collectionfun and mildly challenging this game took me  days of intermittent playing to beat but i was never bored
if you rush through the game is challenging but the story isnt bad
do not play it if you dont have golden sun the lost age because it ends in a cliff hangercreated by a little know developer called camelot they made some mario golf and mario tennis games as well as shining force before they joined nintendo golden sun is one of the gbas more exceptional gamesgolden sun has one major achievement it had for the gba
it pushed the limits of the system in terms of graphics
while the visuals for wandering around seem rather easy for the system to create the battles are a spectacular achievement
even though the characters and enemies are shown as animated sprites
the sprites themselves are not much to write home about but regardless they are quite convincing and suit the battle setup more than you might expect
the battle screen is sort of a quasid setup
the background and sprites are d but they are executed in such a manner that they look d
not only that battle effects such as spells and simple attacks add wonderfully to the setup
the only real problem i can see is that some spell effects slow down the framerates how fast or smoothly it runs noticably but its all handled so well that it doesnt even seem like a glitch and out of sheer irony it adds to the effect of some of the spells hence it may have been done that way on purposethe sound is a mixed bag
the music score part is excellent
everything from the main menu music to town themes and the grand world map music is great both technically and melodically
if any songs do get on your nerves they either wont last long or are done in such a way that you can tune them out while playing
sound effects however are very standard
a lot of them are recycled so much that its practically mind numbing
however none of it seems completely out of place and there isnt much that will hurt your ears so thats something to be happy forthe gameplay itself only has one real flaw in my opinion
the battles are too easy
with the exception of most of the boss battles regular battles tend to be so easy that the thought of using the run option will never occur to you they also go so quick that theres not really a time issue involved either
theres also an issue where if you set all of your characters to attack one enemy and that enemy is destroyed the characters that attack him later have their attack wasted
this really isnt too much of an issue though and camelot was smart enough to make the character automatically defend if that should happen which means damage to that character would be halved though i think that only refers to physical damagethe story has gotten a lot of bad press in my opinion
however it should be noted that if you play this game the story alone may persuade you to buy the next game gs the lost age which is already out
while thats not particularly a bad thing as the combination of the two stories is really awesome just be aware of the extra expense that may cost for your wallet
also it should be noted that this game is a bit on the short side roughly  hours but thats still not much of an issue in my view just so you know the second game in the series is roughly  hours long so that one is lengthierall in all the game is quite fun
however there are a few quirks that i mentioned above that may get on some peoples nerves so just know what youre getting intoi have heard so much good thing about this little gem even before i bought my gba
naturally this game became my first game to be playedlets break down this game without spoiling itgraphic  thumbs up way up
i have yet to see any better looking rpg made for gba
it has charming d graphic combined with jaw dropping bit effect
the result is very colorful and graceful scenery inside outstory  nothing new here
it certainly isnt bad but lacks any twist or kick
that makes it rather blend story for experienced playersound  if you liked the sound of star ocean the second story you will like this equally
after all it is done by same composer
did i mention that he also participated in valkyrie profile as well as star ocean  and sequel of golden sunoverall  definately one of better rpg to play
if you want to start rpg but without traveling back to past this is the game
i hope the sequel improves the storywhile there have been a lot of ports of some fantastic snes rpgs on the advance system there hasnt been any original titles to take advantage of the advances powerful specs
enter golden sun which has graphics that probably couldnt have been done on a super nintendo and a storyline that gives breath of fire a punch in the stomach
nothing will come close to this game till final fantasy tacticsif youre looking for a topline classic rpg adventure for the gba this is it
golden sun does a fine job of demonstrating the impressive new capabilities of the bit system and is a great deal of funin terms of gameplay the game is very similar to the snes classics final fantasy ii and iii
you have a party of up to four characters and combat is turn based
the fighting is fully animated and the spells are quite impressive making full use of the nifty new particle and d effects of the console
there are also a good deal of puzzles to solve mainly by pushing switches casting spells on inanimate objects and jumping over pits
a welldrawn world map and backgrounds make the game quite aesthetically appealing and there are all sorts of new things to see and new more powerful weapons to acquireone unique element in golden sun is the use of djinni which you assign to your characters
depending on how many and what sort you give them your characters will gain new spells and attributes
you can also summon them after the fashion of espers in ff iii or guardian forces in ff viii but in addition to doing some sort of beneficial effect say raising everyones defense depending on how many and what sort you use you are able to summon a powerful onetime attack on enemies
its a tradeoff though since summoning will remove whatever benefits the particular djinn gave to the character
this gives you two distinct possible strategies for difficult battles trying to summon them to death or just fighting it out with your bonuses and magic intactmost of the puzzles are related to finding new djinni
you can avoid them and just continue with the main quest but this will net you fewer djinni and therefore reduced powers
there are also sidequests that will give you powerful items or weapons but also arent necessary to completing the game
although some of the puzzles are pretty tough theyre not impossible and none of the ones related to the main quest are that difficultthe level design is well thought out and the mechanics of the game function very well
as i have hinted at earlier the graphics are very impressive better than anything on the snes
the soundtrack is also very well done although not quite as good as nobuo uematsus ff scoresabout the only complaint i have about golden sun is that it was too short
even if you finish up all the subquests the game is only about  hours long more or less depending on how familiar you are with similar rpgs
this is of course because there is a sequel planned
i cant say the game was much of a challenge either but thats probably because some of the other similar rpgs ive played are pretty tough
nevertheless golden sun was a great deal of fun and well worth the cost
i am looking forward to the sequelwoohah
i just finished doom  again on my pc about  or  days back and ive gotta say that i absolutely loved itthe storyline is a simple as possible probably designed to keep you the player focused on the game as a whole rather than being distracted by the story itself
in a nutshell hell has broken loose on earth and the demons have taken the population of earth hostage
you are a marine who has managed to survive the invasion of earth and now it falls upon you to beat back the demon hordes free earths population and destroy the mastermind behind the sinster attack  even if it means going into the heart of hell to do so
its so terribly simplistic that its poetic  its the original storyline that sparked off all fps games after it
today storyline would get  but in  it wouldve gotten graphics wise doom  is not spectacular but unlike doom  you are able to adjust the screen resolution to create smoother looking enemies and environments
levels are cleverly designed however and theres alot of space to shoot enemies with weapons like the rocket launcher
the enemies and characters are all dimensional but theres quite a significant amount of detail that has been put into each and every character and demon
by todays standards the detail is purile
but back then it wouldve been revolutionary
i dunno for me the graphics dont detract from the game itself
i would give the graphics  for today and  if it were sound is alot better in doom  than in doom 
doom  had terribly lame sounds for enemies and i couldnt help but laugh when i shot a zombieman
i mean when the guys die they go hooya
i mean come on thats hilarious
doom  has much scarier sounds but some weapons like the arachnotrons plasma cannons sound dreadfully silly
music is ok at best sounds like something a  year old put together while it was karaoke night at his families place
ill give sound  to be fair and music gameplay  this is where doom  doesnt fail
its an absolute blastfestyou run jump shoot tonnes of rounds off at hordes of angry enemies
unlike doom  you can also look up and down to shoot enemies above or below you
this greatly adds to the enjoyment of the game as the y and zaxes are now considered rather than just the xaxis
battles are frantic on the harder skill levels and i often found myself punching and chainsawing enemies into red oozing piles of their former selves
its always nice to go on a melee assault
ah the good ol days
there are plenty of cool weapons including a chainsaw pistol shotgun and supershotgun chaingun missile launcher plasma gun and of course the almighty bfg  the holy grail of every gun that has ever been created in fps shooters
its so nice to shoot the original bfg and watch your enemies turn to microwaved pigslop
what can i say extreme firepower frenetic action  cant fault gameplay even today
 dont arguedifficulty is fair
not quite as hard as i was originally expecting there were some situations that required some prior planning and even constant replaying but doom  is by no means impossible even on the ultraviolence setting
nightmare can be itensely challenging at times but ive only finished the game on ultraviolence
i dont have the energy to take on nightmare
difficulty gets  for ultraviolence and  for nightmare
the other skills are not challenging enough in my opinioni enjoy the range of enemies  you get zombiemen sargeants chaingunners imps hell knights barons of hell cacodemons arachnotrons spider demons cyber demons pain elementals lost souls demons arch viles revenants mancubus and spectres
not bad for a  game huh
enemies get  from my side  lots to kill  lots of funyou get plenty of powerups and tonnes of secrets to look for
there are more enemies than humanly imaginable to kill and enough weapons to take down  well hell itself i guess
what more do you really need
crack open a brewski and let the demon slaughter beginin short doom  gets   by todays standards
the fun factor and length of the game is enough to get it an aaggregate
this is a classic fps shooter that you have to have finished
i just got the game from a friend and copied it to my hard drive
it takes up minimal space and is great for impressing your friends or a rainy day
play doom  now and you will know pain and pleasure in their purest formsthis game is truly a classic
improvements over the last edition especially in graphics make this game even better
it us a lot of fun to play and the gameplay is quite solid
this is a solid buyi had the old dos installs on this game and it played great under win and win without a problem
i brought this version for windows  and installed it and the game itself runs fine but having to go through a preload screen each time you play is a real drag
the only reason i can see for a menu outside of the games menu is to keep people from having to enter command line parameters when starting the game at the command line
when you get into the game it plays just like the dos version did
you save and load games change volume settings etc
just like in the dos version
its just a bit much to have to go through two sets of menus to start the game
oh and by the way adding a screen resolution item that doesnt change much doesnt helpthis game was once the best one could find in the computer world
those days have passed but this game makes a low cost find for those searching for a way to pass the time on lower end computersi fianlly managed to find a demo site that wasnt going to take odd hours to download a demo even though i have a cable modemthe game looks very good
raven did a good job of tweeking the slightly older quake ii engine so that the graphics are still amazing
the weapons and sound effects thereof are quite good
the enemy ai is very nicely modeled too
you cant just run up and blast someone they will hear youthe all to famous gore is just as advertised
ive seen other games that i thought were pretty neat and sof put them to shamei plan on buying the platinum edition of this game as soon as i can afford it
which will be about another week and a half
i will update my review with a new star rating if needed just as soon as i get my copythe wordofmouth factor for this game was off the charts when it was released due to the supposedly incredible level of violence displayed throughout the game
is it violent
yeah but that sort of gimmickry really only works on the teenagers and washington dc lobbyists
the excessive gore gets old quicker than youll anticipate but thankfully youll still be left with an aboveaverage firstpersonshooterthe developers called it ghoul translated it means the baddies react to wherever they get shot sometimes hopping on one foot sometimes covering their netherregions or simply revealing some blownout intestines
its interesting about the first dozen times but afterwards its just more sameold sameold
this ghoul system isnt defined enough to really provide a wealth of anatomically correct reactions only about  or the gameplay itself is based on the nowclassic quake ii engine and while not providing the depth of rainbow six or the intricate plot of halflife it still manages to give the singleplayer gamer a compelling ride
the story is fairly thin almost nonexistant and the gameplay is linear to the point where any deep thought is rarely called for
just kill everyone you see except the occasional civilian who you most certainly will kill anyway because the targeting cursor is so small that distinguishing green from red is practically impossible in the heat of battlethe platinum edition is nothing more than the gold edition with  extra multiplayer levels a preview of sof and the brady games strategy guide which is provided on disc not in book form
so in short it is worth it and stands on its own as a derivative straightforward yet fun fps
just dont count on the carnage providing any longterm satisfactionas i was installing soldier of fortune platinum a prompt asked me if i wanted to put some limits on the level of blood and gore in the gamequotnahquot i said
quothow bad could it be anywayquotboy was i in for a surprise
ive been shooting things in games ever since i was  and id have to say that soldier of fortune would be  in blood and gore so farshoot any enemy in any place and they react in the proper waya shot in the foot will result in bad guy grabbing his leg or lack thereof
my favorite thing to do when im in an evil mood is to unload a whole clip of smg bullets into a bad guys chest and watch him do that crazy dance of histhe game does have limits but only in story and level design
but when youre in the mood to just walk in and blast away a few hundred bad guys simple story and linear levels can be a good thing
just dont let little kids play sof or even watch you play it without the parental controls onive played magic the gathering on and off for years
the video versions have always been terrible
yugioh dark duel stories is nothing like those
its fun its addictive and youll waste a good portion of any given day playing it
its not just that its a wellpaced game its that its also an intuitive game
i had no idea how to play it when i bought the game the instruction manual is spotty at best ill be purchasing the strategy guide when it comes out but after  or  rounds i had a handle on the play mechanics and the meager instructions that were included started to make sense
im anxious to link up and play against a human but for now theres no shortage of challenging computer opponents to play against
also worth mentioning is the amazing card library thats included more than  individual cardsplus the card construction area that allows you to customize up to  cardsnow the downside the graphics are fairly simplistic and in some cases downright rough theres not a lot of animation and the music is pretty annoying and not one of those things takes away for a minute from the great gameplay
if you can find it buy it you wont be disappointedi specialize in card games and this is one of the best
it doesnt have much of a plot just the card game but i dont consider that to be a drawback
its very valuable for fans of the show because it makes it much easier to understand whats going on
there are a few different rules than in the show however
the higher powered cards can only be played by quotsacrificingquot other cards currently in play so you seldom run into the more popular cards like the dark magician or the blueeyes but it adds a new layer of strategy that i like
you get to play everyone from tristan and little yugi to yami yugi himself he cheats though
it also has a feature where you can design your own cards and trade them with friends
it automatically saves whenever you do anything so you dont have to think about saving it ever
get this game if you can find it its rare and im not giving up my copythis game is awesome
in your quest to get to the final level and the keeper of the magical items you must pass through many levels dueling your favorite tv
characters in yugioh
some of them include triston joey kaiba and even yugioh and yami yugiohalso now instead of lugging your cards everywhere you can now just turn your gameboy on and play to your hearts content
a yugiohs fans mustorigionally when i purchased this game i was expecting to quickly pick up and learn how to master the game
i was wrong this game require well thought out strategy and is not easy to quickly create a good deck
once i read the manuel on how to play the actual card game i realized theat this has the weirdest and most obsurd rules compared to the real game
in dark duel stories there are hardley any trap or magic cards a kuriboh weakest monster in the game is capable to beat the blue eyes white dragonstrongest monster in the game because of a new rule the threw into this game alone
you cant use special abilities of cards you cant use ritual cards you can somehow fuse cards together without polymerization and many other flaws
if you are a new yu gi oh player do not waist your money on this version get eternal duelest sould for game boy advance
if oyu have played it before do not unlearn strategy by geting this gamethe graphics are not up to par with other playstation rpgs
in fact this game would have been more at home on the snes
but as anyone over  will remember good rpgs are not based solely on fmvenhanced graphicsthe story is similar to that of chrono trigger involving young warriors who travel through time to improve the future
but it is not as simple as that there are many pitfalls along the way
tough monsters evil bosses and mindbending puzzles mean that this game will keep you busy for  hours minimum assuming you ignore detours in your quests
for players who liked vandal hearts this game is similar in its graphics and gameplaythe dragon warrior series is the only one that even comes close to rivalling final fantasy not only in the volume of games but the quality of them
players who are less concerned with fancy graphics and more concerned with story characters and challenge this game is a must
but gamers who are concerned with the opposite might not be able to get beyond the poor graphics
the choice is yoursi have before criticized dragon warrior vii for what i thought was monotonous gameplay but had found that what i was required to do was optional and that progressing through the game is actually reasonable in difficulty and it does have the medieval environment and turnbased system one would ask for and there are many classes to choose from
the characters have their own unique personalities and make their own decisions throughout the course of the game which is rare in a lot of rpgs
i can appreciate the monotony of the turnbased battles as a break from always having to have quick reflexes in their actionrpg counterparts
there are also a large variety of spells that your character can learn especially if you change the characters class to cleric and other such classes
you can also have a more powerful warrior if he is under the warrior or fighter class
there is no other rpg that replicates the medieval beauty such as this one that i have found i can only find those kinds of rpgs on the snes or nes
i apologize for the original negative review as the game did not deserve that kind of press from momentary frustration
enjoyyikes myself being no newbie to the rpg scene i felt confident from previews that this game would be a long time addition to my collection
wow
i mean i really really really tried to get into this game
infact i logged more than  hours in the dragonwarrior  world
i think the biggest problem was the linear storyline
it was just too much of a chore
the story in a nutshell is the world has been split in about  sections you then must revive each section in the past so you can save it in the present
hmmmm well alright
i first marveled at this use of time travel but as time went on it was a huge pain
it just wasnt enjoyable as i first thought
it made the game incredibly linear
and because of all the storylines each land had a different one you lose the intimacy with the characters
besides the storyline the battle engine i thought was the second thing that needed the most improvement
yes i know its like everyother traditional dragonwarriordragonquest game
but come on battles shouldnt have to be a chore all the time
overall i knew i was going to have to put up with the less than favorable dragonwarrior menu interface but i was hoping they would make up for it in the storyline
i dunno i was just expecting more from this company
to the same people that gave us amazing titles terranigma and robotrek for the snes get it togetherat first glance when the average gamer starts this game they wonder about this games expectations
it boasts a hundred hours of gameplay so that must mean that the graphics must be really good right
well most gamers take one look at the graphics fiddle around with the game for a little bit and give up completely
i warn you this game is not for those who are only out for the flasy graphics or the gameplay thats so simple any fiveyearold could complete it in their sleep
this game is not simpleminded
no its not final fantasy  its dragon warrior and having a game that just screams quotold schoolquot and boasts about it for a ridiculously long time is absolutely fine with meas i already said at first glance this game is not particularly pretty to stare at
but if anybody spends enough time with the game youll tend to ignore this little minor detail
thats right minor
this is dragon warrior and the focus is on gameplay here not making everything look pretty
the majority of the game focuses strictly on battle where your strategic wits are most needed
instead of todays quotattack heal repeatquot strategy youll have to dig deeper if you want to come out of the battles alive
in other games in which spells that increase your attack and defense are practically useless in dragon warrior vii they are all but requiredas well at first glance the plot seems as linear as it could be
as the heroes of the game you have decided to embark on a quest to recover lands lost due to an unknown evil via time travel
this may seem like a pointless game where it all seems like all you have to keep doing is go back in time and rescue the helpless people then go to the next land save it and do it over and over again
however the more time you spend with the game the more this seemingly linear plot unfolds
the more lands you restore the more you learn about this unknown evil
that seems to be the basis of most video games in general but for some reason this one seems that much different
not to mention there is this one cruel and sadistic plot twist that will leave your jaw dropping and frozen in that position for an indefinite length of time
i will not mention what it is for that would be spoiling thingsone thing that i havent mentioned that should really be noted is of course the musical score
koichi sugiyama is the goto guy and has written the scores for the previous dragon warrior games
while the music for other games has a blatant technonew age appearance sugiyama has decided to stick with a much more traditional orchestralbased sound and to me that creates a really powerful emotional tool during crucial points of the game at times
its really a great score and really adds to the experiencein conclusion all i have to say is to give this game an honest chance
dont dislike it because it isnt final fantasy and it isnt as attractivelooking
because of this misjudgment most gamers are missing out on this remarkable innovative gaming experience
you should play the game to experience what old school is all about and will possibly be as close to an actual journey to rid evil as anything will ever be
dont be one of the several gamers who have turned their backs on this game for trivial reasons
this game is that and much moreyoure missing out
big timefor the quaint graphics the thin dare i say twodimensional
characters the soso plot and the timeintensive job system i still spent most of the journey enjoying myselfthe graphics are a huge leap over previous dragon warrior incarnations at least the previous united states immigrants and a huge leap behind other contemporaneous rpgs but not far enough behind to capture nostalgia value
characters are flat literally meander through a threedimensional world colorful but somewhat blandcertainly nothing close to the meticulously detailed cityscapes et al of the final fantasy series
easier on the eyes than your oldschool nes games to be sure but nothing of any independent attraction
battles are quick too but still text based the enemies in a strange mix between action and screen begin moving only when attackingat other times they appear like pictures in a bookthe plot is gargantuanperhaps tediousa systematic search through myriad islands enlarging the original overworld in the process
each island has its own little conflict to solve some of which are fun on the way one picks up pieces of the overarching problem which i wont give away here
to make new islands appear one must collect shards discovering one gives one a glimmer of satisfaction that proves addictivethat ultimate plot when it emerges doesnt cohere particularly well and its hard to care about the vacuous primary characters much less the interchangeable secondary characters
still ill be damned if there isnt an intensely enjoyable aspect to the constant cycle of discovery and exploration of the rising islands of gaining new abilities through the job system of trying to fulfill one of the sidequeststhe dragon warriors have always been marked by an extremely meritocratic gameplayif you want something you have to earn it
hours must be spent in the field gaining experience before youre set to venture to a new continent or have the necessary funds for subsequent levels of armor and weaponrythat is their and this installations charm which makes itfor all its shortcomings the music is pleasant but simple as well and anachronismsworth recommending
i do soafter all by this late date the game finally might have some of that nostalgic valuedqw and ff series have been good competition to each other until certain point
ff series started taking customer friendly approach while dqw kept its originality
i had almost forgotten what real rpg should be good storyline short and simple battle system joy of increasing levels and inclusion of human drama
dqw  has all of these elementsgameplay is very easy to learn unlike ff junction materia and ability system if you are after fancy magic and summon beasts using superb graphics then this is not your kind of gamedegree turning might make feel ill until you get used to itthere are a few things i found quite annoying
although it states that total playing time is more than hours what takes half that time is building your characters levels and it is necessity in order to get past certain points
another word a player needs to spend enormous amount of hours on mindless battles
if you dont have much time to play you may find it very very long
hardly any events relate to each other
it is almost like begin one event end one event unlike other rpgs you dont ever come back to the same place
there is no sense of freedom a player is very limited to what heshe can do in the game
if you miss one itemevent the story does not progress and no one tells you what to dohowever this is a piece of art and yet it is very challenging for most rpg players
i recommed this for advanced rpg players otherwise you will end up hating itim not a big sprint car person and i didnt know jack about how to set it up to race with a wheel its difficult not to spin out but it is funif you are into sprint cars i think you will love the realism of this gamethe mud flyingthe serious pile upsthis is sprint cars done righti do want to put out a buyer beware thoughif you want to get this game new be very careful who you buy it fromi paid a jacked up price to dvds dvdsdotcom about  dollars to get it new and factory sealed as they advertised itit came with a big white generic security tab on the side where the game opensthe cellophane was all sticking to the game case like it was glued to it to keep it on snugwhen the cellophane was off i saw little pieces of residue and tiny bits of gray tape where the original security strip is normally foundthe game manual also showed signs of usebeware if you buy from alternate vendors on this siteits a common pracitce for many to repack out of print games to jack up the new priceif you dont need to have them new you might as well buy a used copythis way you know what your getting and dont pay another  for the same used game cause they claim it was newdvds is not the only merchant here engaged in this practice but they were the most recent ones who duped meplaying this game ten years after its release and finally writing a review for it should speak volumes about how this game has aged
growing up next to a local dirt track and enjoying simulation racers this game has been the best that i have came across
the pros heavily outweigh the cons
for world of outlaws fanatics the game is licensed and includes all of the major drivers that at least i have heard of in the series along with  real tracks and  fictional ones
the graphics can be tough to look at but you must keep in mind that they were easily passable for their time and do not detract from the racing experience at all in my mind
for gearheads the race cars themselves are extremely customizable
the career mode is standard flairstart off with very limited funds racing your way from the local series up to the more prestigious series
where the game really stands out is the racing itself
just as in real life and groundbreaking at the time it was released the track changes as the races go on forcing you to find the fastest line on the track
another thing that i like about the game is the driving ai
while they sometimes act as if you are not there and hold their lines they do not drive perfectly and make mistakes which i see as a plus
i dont like being the one that is always responsible for the caution flag
where the game lacks for me is the presentation the same tracks and commentary get a little old after youve logged enough laps
collision detection is not true to actual sprint car racing but better than most games that i have played factoring in more recent ps games as well
you can rub tires and not go end up flipping down the track
the game is far from perfect but stands out as the best sprint car racing simulation that i have played to this day
pick it up but be aware that if playing on a ps the game did occasionally freeze on methis is a pretty good game with only a few flaws
i would recomend it
it is fun challenging but not way to hard
the only bad thing is the annoying soundto say i was skeptical about spending  on a surfing game would be the understatement of the year
however the good buzz around the game gave me the confidence i needed to give it a try and i am happy that i did so
transworld surf is not an easy game to pick up in the first couple of hours but enough patience and effort will pay off in a rewarding game experience
some of the goals connected to the career mode could have been left out yet it does add another dimension to the overall gameplay and helps you practice certain tricksmoves
the graphics are exceptional and the difficulty of progressing in career mode is a welcomed challenge
the multiplayer games are also fun except for the tricky king of the wave
forget about the snowboarding and skateboarding games this is the one you need if you want to have a socalled extreme sports game
i rated it  stars but my actual rating if possible would be   stars
it is that good and it is that funyeah its pretty funbut you know what bothers me most about this game
the trick system
most of it is just button combinations like in a fighting game
you dont feel much connection to the buttons you press and what the animations are doing
it feels a little too restricted and just not that thrilling
you can do a back flip but its really slow  impossible to do two of them in one ramp
as far as barrel rolls well there are none
in wave race  they might not have been a big variety of stuff but i was actually maneuvering the watercraft in the air
when i would land a double barrel roll i let out a big fat yessss
i never say yessss when i play this game
but yeah the water is pretty dang pretty to look at
the rider models aint too shabby either although they all look pretty much the same
i wish the game had a freestyle mode where it focused on pulling off tough tricks
even in free ride ive tried to ramp around but everything seems pretty regulated
things were in wave race  too but all you needed was an imagination as well as a little creativity and you could take that game apart lol
but yeah splashdowns water is pretty dang pretty to look atanother thing is the music  it doesnt appeal to my taste particularly  but thats just me  i would have gone with a more generic aquatic sounding music that anyone could get used to
i wouldnt say that the game sucks for its music though
if you like smashmouth and the donnas which i do not then youll be fine
even if you dont just turn it down low and it aint so bad since youre distracted by the pretty wateri dont want to give you the idea that this game sucks with all my nitpicking
there are a suprising amount of tracks good control unlockables and secret shortcuts
its worth getting for the price that its selling at
oh yeah and one more thing  pretty wateratari the great video maker of the s finally returns to next gen gaming with this aquatic journey of pure fun and excitement
i got this game for christmas and i have been playing it since then
it is simply a great game
the first thing that sticks out in my mind about this game is the beautiful visuals
the water effects are stunning and the character and vehicle graphics are quite good as well
the backgrounds are nice and they tend to match the location
greek architecture in greece
the jet skis in the game tend to control very realisticallyexcept for the height of jumps
when you turn your watercraft it bobs around in the water like a real seadoo
the watercrafts also respond to waves and turns just like a real seadoo
the vibration on the ps dual shock is nice as well as it coincides with every bump or ramp that your seadoo hitsnext up is sound and the game has a very good soundtrack
it is a new age mixture of rock punk and hiphop
the sound effects are also very goodthe only problem i have with this game is the difficulty of performing certain tricks
the first level of tricks are relatively easy but then it gets extremely hard
later on tricks require pushing two or three buttons as well as swiveling the joystick perfectly in a certain direction
it is very hard to perform and even when you do figure it out it is hard to be consistent with it
the tricks should have been more like tony hawk or somethingoverall this game is really great
you will be mezmerized by the water effects which blow away ns waverace
if you liked waverace for n you will simply love this game
it is kinda like a jetski version of ssx but not quite as fun or as stunning
but it really does deliver a great aquatic gaming experience
look below for nemerical ratingsgraphics   control     because of the tricks onlysound    gameplay   replay value   storyline  na pure racing gaame not much story to itthe game is a racing game
the game is not really about doing tricks
the tricks come into play however in that doing tricks causes your power meter to increase thus making your watercraft much faster
on harder levels it is impossible to win a race without doing tricksthe game is really quite difficult to play
it requires lots of playing time to perfect your skillsrealistic water actioneach watercraft has distinctive features and handlingdynamic wakes rolling waves and turbulence awesome locationsall of that stuff above makes this rockall of that stuff below makes this game not rockonly  people in multiplayerless then  vehiclesso as a whole it has stuff that makes this rock and stuff that makes it not rock
but this game deserves  stars and gets  stars
buy this if you like any other water games or you like anything that has to do with waterinfogrames has made a great game the movement of the camera over the rider its soft and realistic
the camera doesnt move as much as other games so you dont get a headache while playing
the places were you run are well done you go to plenty of exciting places
the problem is that you cant choose the seadoo youd like to have or the color of the suit for the riderand the number of riders is limited for my taste
however this game is very well done
buy it you dont waste time and moneythe game that started it all for me on ps was jet moto
i hated  but enjoyed a lot of good two player action on   splashdown is the nearest thing to these titles available on ps
the game takes place entirely on water except when you are jumping through the air
the water is not just a flat plane though
there are waves and rocks and you must control the amount of hydroplaning your jet ski does
alternately you can dive underwater for short periods of time
the soundtrack on this title rocks and actually has hit music that many young people listen to
the big drawback of the sound is that it is not  ssx tricky has spoiled me in this department but if you are not someone who has surround sound dtsdolby digital you will not miss thisokay there are plenty of games that are more exciting out there but this is a really nice family game to have
it is good clean and fun
the graphics are good but not great and the physics are for the most part realistic and believable
the controls are easy to pick up and the tricks are fairly easy to complete
splashdown contains a good mix of upbeat music and the gameplay should keep you occupied for a decent amount of time
just remember although the game is fun dont expect a heartpounding adrenalineproducing experiencethe ps isnt the greatest version of max paynepc isbut youd be missing out if you havent experienced it yetmax payne is a cinematic filmnoir type game that mixes you standard action and intrigue
the story is as cliched as they come a rogue cop framed for murder must fight against incredible odds to survive
this is from the same people who made grand theft auto the pss crowning title
here is my impressions of max paynethe pros cinematics
the story sequences come in two forms as an onscreen graphic novel and full motion sequences
they highlight the important points in the game quite well
despite what others say i dont think the voice acting is that bad
believe me ive heard much worse
the cinematic cutscenes make the game much more enjoyable
the details
what else would you expect from a ps game
the graphics are similar to grand theft auto iii in that the city the buildings the rooms and the enemies are very intricately detailed
unlike gta that is almost no popup in the background and the rendering is amazing
but it is the little details that will strike you
you can turn lights on and off move boxes and even make drinks come out of the coke machine in the hotel this is early on in the game
note that i have layed both the ps and xbox versions and have noticed no difference
the automatic save
there is nothing more frustrating than getting killed before youve had a chance to save your game
at the beginning of each new segment your game is saved
it does the work for you
i like that feature a lot
the ai
the enemies are tougher to beat here since the difficult levil changes according to your progress
if you are having a hard time in the game the enemies will lighten up slightly
but if you are having a ball they will get tougher on you
they are also very good at evading your attacks
the improved ai
artificial intellegence in case you didnt know gives the game more challenge
storyline
though it has its ups and downs the story is classic filmnoir
i didnt get max payne looking for an innovative storyline though i wouldnt have complained if it was
it is a good oldfashioned caper storythe cons loading time
it seems that max payne has a longer than normal loading time wich can be very frustrating if you get killed off a lot in the beginning
since the game is so well detailed i can only assume that is why it takes longer to load
the game takes about  minutes to get the game up and running so patience is a vitrue you must possess to play max payne
control
though this becomes less of a con as you get used to it the controls are tough
unlike most games max payne requires use of both analog sticks so it take a bit of getting used to
people who have played silent hill before will probably know what i mean
also the targeting system is tricky in the begining since all you have to aim with is a white dot on screen
sometimes you cannot skip through the cinematic cutscenes which is frustrating is you get killed and have to sit through the same bits over and over againi bought max payne on the recommendation of a friend who is pickier than i am when it comes to video games
i am very impressed with max payne and am now addicted to it
some games are like that
anyone who liked gta or metal gear solid  sons of liberty will love max paynerepetitive play knocking down doors and jumping thru stuff to shoot people gets old story is sort of thin and even though it has different endings you have to go thru the same stuffin one of the most innovative video games i have ever played quotmax paynequot is a exciting gritty and extremely bloody game brought to you by rockstar games makers of the violent quotgrand theft autoquot seriesyou play as max payne a new york undercover cop who after the death of his family is framed for a murder of his superior and battles the mob his own people and a whole lot worse
the game is really action packed
but i was somewhat confused by the storyline
i had trouble keeping up with it by all the additional backstory and other locations max venturesthe climax is was a letdown
for some gamers out there i never actually finished the game
the last level is extremely hard to finish
rockstar games did a fair job of developing the game
quotmax paynequot has somewhat onerate but realistic graphics
but i enjoyed the urban settings in every level
it really feels like a new york ghetto
the voice acting is pretty good despite some misunderstandings with the charactersi enjoyed killing all the bad guys
they become tired after a while but thats ok there are alot of weapons to choose from
but the most memorable sequence in this game is to use slow  motion gameplay called quotbullettimequot
some other guy called it quotslowdownquot
how silly
anyway bullettime cannot be used every time since its only use from moment to momentquotmax paynequot is a fine game to play
despite some flaws its still fun
i havent played part  but i heard its goodthis game packs a lot of fun for just 
the slow diving is neat and dodging bullets is really fun
the plot is weird and i hate the dream levels where you have to run on that little red line and jump to other little red lines
after i spent half an hour on this you hope hed wake up
cool levels
hard if you dont use slowmoi had just finished max payne and it was a fun game with a story line
after finishing it i do feel like playing it again good thing because xmas is close and you never know what you get in your stocking
the levels that go into max psyche are a little creepy for my tastes
i had to turn it off when my  year old daughter goes in because if it gives me nightmares i shudder to think what it could do to her
there is also a lot of violence to boot
in case you have not figured it out this is not one for kids
the action is good and the bullet time is a nice feature when you seem to be out numbered
my wife doesnt care for the painkillers which seem to promote drug use
then again this is one of the reasons it gets a mature rating im surethe levels are not too hard however i had to resort to the cheats to get through the exploding restaurant because the walkthrough didnt explain it well enough
please bear in mind if you do resort to the cheats the game will make it real easy
if you want to challenge yourself but you get stuck at a level you can make max godlike to get through the level and then at the next save just load the level and you will be mortal againif you like games like syphon filter or metal gear solid you will like this gamei throughly enjoyed this game
the voice acting may not be the greatest but i think the gameplay is really well done and the atmospheres are fantastic
the controls take some getting used too and are not for everyone
they are a problem and could have been better to control surprisenly i can do it very well
the major problem i have is that as the game progresses it gives you less times to save so you have to go through almost an entire level though short and complete it without saving once
that is so stupid because if you die at the end you have to do the entire level over again that is the dumbest thing ever in a video game
i just feel its unfair for the game makers to make a fairly difficult level then make you do it over and over if you slip and die toward the end
stupid stupid stupidthe levels can be a bit difficult if youre not one to be quick on the trigger
and as much i gripe on the camera angles theyre useful in stopping max at the end a hall swing the camera around and see if an enemy is around the corner waiting on the steps right inside the next room etc
it gives you a heads up and makes it easier to stay alivehowever i still really liked it
i didnt enjoy mp as much but mp which should end the series i think should re should be much better
im looking forward to itmax payne is a very entertaining darkthemed action shooter
the ps version has some occasional slowdown but these bits do not take much away from the overall experience
also the loading screens are frequent and fairly long
plenty of violence and exciting gameplay elements make this game an obvious choice for shooter or action game fans and should be a permanent addition to a mature ps librarymax payne is a man with nothing to lose in the violent cold and snowy new york night
max was a undercover cop for the nypd but now he has been framed for murder
hes a fugitive hunted by the mob and the police
and is fighting a battle he cant hope to win but you domax payne is from the same people that brought us grand theft auto iii and the quality that was apparent in that game is here as well
the game only has one mode story mode
the story is outstanding and has more plot twists than any other video game i have ever playedin max payne you fight through several mob families to find out why his wife and baby girl were murdered and how to show the nypd that he is innocent
max goes to the very bottom of the barrel of crime and you have to lead him through it all
the bullettime gameplay feature is very fun to do and makes the game look like the scifi movie the matrixby the time you get to the second level of the game you realize that max payne is an actionshooting game that is in many ways supperior ro other action games
it is very hard but at the same time very fun
its like a john woo thriller straight of hong kong only you get to play it
max payne is a great video game experience whether you buy it on playstaion  x box or pc
so order it and prepare for painyoure a cop in new york
they killed your wife and daughter and now you are mad
this is a very cool action quotsyphon filterquot type of game
the story is great and the effects in this game is what sets it apart from being a syphon filter copy
the quotbullet timequot effect is the coolest thing i have ever seen in a video game
the slow motion matrix style action scenes the blood and violence and the story line make this video game play like a movie
the best way i can describe it is syphon filter meets metal gear solid
once you get use to the controls and i must say the only reason i didnt give this one  stars is because they are a little complicated you will enjoy this game
i can definitely see sequels coming down the roadcool stress relieving kill everyone and ask questions later game check this one outgraphics this isnt what counts
as it is a ps they could improve the characters a little improve them like they are in ghost recon
there is a lot of fire in this game but no smoke
im wondering why we arent suffocating
minor flaw
the biggest problem as well as the biggest problem in the game is the frame rate per minute
the fpm kind of lags a lot during gameplay but after a while you really get used to it and the gameplay still remains highgameplay the only problem i have with this game is the camera and sometimes the unfair surprise of explosions causing the game to spend about  minutes loading again
otherwise the gameplay was smooth and rather funthis game does have the tendacy to get extremely boring so bewarestoryline ehhh its pretty much like every other ps game out there
youre framed for murder and you go out to seek revengesolitude
the whole wife and baby deal comes into play a lot in this gamethe voices suck in this game the writing is even worse
they sound like a loser i know in the seventh gradecontrols nicely done
the trigger button is r which i really respect
it takes about  minutes until you memorize the controls completelymusic and sounds the only reason i gave this section a  out of  is because of the sole reason that there is no music during the game
but when there is music main menu and some cutscenes i completely love it
it is mere piano music but very seductive to my ears
the sounds are superior as the gunshots sound like gunshots there are grunts at the right time and it sounds like you are actually really in a gunfightoverall this is not a score where if you multiply it it will come to be 
i would really give this game a  out of end reviewltltltltthe goodlots of shootinggreat missionsloads of funthe badcontrolsgraphicsscaryscaryscarythis is a great game
i have all the cheats so i have all the levels right from the starti play all sorts of themits a very freaky starting in maxes house
overall its a very good game and i would recommend it to people  and over
if you get the cheat of unlimited health then you survive the whole game without dying
slow motion rocks its so awsome
rockstar games make a sequal and a movie would be nice tothis game is great
the slow down action is cool
its like the focus in the matrix
you can dodge bullets when in this mode amp everything is enhanced
you can see the blast of your sawed off amp the bullet
i like it better then gta vice city
vice city is a better game overall
i just prefer max payne
the gore gun play amp the underworld people are fun to interact with
the story is really good
the intro to the game is nice
you start out at home finding your wife amp kid dead ugh
what a starti cant wait to get the xbox version
im very jealous of you xbox owners
i know the games much better on your system
i might buy a xbox just for this game
the ps version is good
but has glitches amp the framerate isnt as good as it should be
without those flaws on the xbox version its a must to getmax payne from rockstar and remedy entertainment isnt just a great game
its a compassionate and suspenseful drama with plently of killing to satisfy any action fan
payne a lonelydonothing kind of man is surprised to find out the gangsters who murdered his wife and child in cold blood three years ago are smuggling a very addictive drug into the country
armed with such weapons as dual ingrams desert eagles and pump action shotguns payne starts his own one man war against these gangsters with several people helping him
the game is a fast roller coaster ride and keeps you glued to the screen
bullet time which is perhaps the greatest part of the gameallows to kill the gangsters in slow motion and watch as their blood sprays all over the wall
with bullet time every minute you feel like youre in the matrix
the game features a wide variety of weapons and a lot of levels and gangsters
the game offers hours and hours of gameplay and is incredible
however there are several cons id like to address
the game is way too easy and could be beaten in half a month
theres no extremely hard puzzles and its a basic shootemup game
for example out of five doors only one opens and all you have to do is climb staircases to other floors and shoot the bad guys there
the voiceacting is horrible
there is a cutscene in the beginning of every chapter
if you die and start over you have to watch this cutscene over and over again and you cant skip it
the blood doesnt look as realistic as it does in other shootemup games
when you shoot at bad guys they all lose blood the same way
after theyre dead you can still shoot em and get new blood but the old blood will disappear
graphics are ok not horrible but not great
though this is a dark and violent game i just dont seem to liek games where you only play in the dark
theres not one level of daylight and you got to wonder  whats max doing during that timedespite its cons the game is a must buy for fans of action and adventure game
theres hundreds and hundreds of gangsters to shoot up and you can do some stuff you  cant do in other games such as turn on tvs listen to the radio  and get sodas from vending machinesmax payne is a must get
its an awesome drama and deserves to be in the hands of every good gamerowing a big debt to older john woo films note the reference to chow yunfat the matrix and just about any crime noir film or graphic novel max payne is a gritty action game that strives to be better than it is
you play as max payne former undercover cop who faces off against the mafia the police and anyone else who stands in his way
the storyline of the game is your typical revenge thriller and it is presented here via graphic novel pages complete with voice acting
the voice acting isnt as bad as it is reputed to be but the characterizations are so cliche and sometimes cheesy that youll just want to skip past these parts
the graphics are gritty looking and present the violent gritty atmosphere of the game perfectly and while this ps version of the game doesnt offer the best graphics as opposed to its pc and xbox counterparts they are very well done nonetheless
the control is tight for the most part although the jumping controls and analog stick can be a bit touchy for some
the bullettime feature adds a new dimension of strategy to the game allowing you to aim your weapon in real time while your enemies move extremely slow
true max payne is a very violent game but compared to gta  vice city or even state of emergency this game pales in comparison violence wise
all in all max payne is a great game despite its shortcomings and now that its one of the pss greatest hits it is worth picking upi havent played the xbox version or pc versions of this game which are supposed to be superior but this game is a great game
the graphics arent the best that ive ever seen on the ps in fact they look just a little better than goldeneye
but the gameplay is great
the controls are a little bit weird to get used to but once you get used to them its pretty easy
it looks alot like the world is not enough but this game has one thing that alot of action games dont depth
the game follows a great plot throughout the game and shows great cinematics and voiceovers
although this is a wonderful game weird controls and lack of too much detail in the game are its problems
there is alot of innovative things in the game that redefine the action genre like those slowmovement things and the bullets
rent this game before you buy it
it is very intense at some points and gets very hardi bought this game an it was worth it
the only real problem i have is with the graphics
in my opinion these graphics are only psx quality
kind of like mgs graphics
my mom says that ive been spoiled mgss graphics
my mom is stupid
anyway other then the graphics this is a great game
go out and get it todaymax payne is a man with nothing to loose in the violent cold urban night
a fugitive undercover cop framed for murder and now hunted buy the cops and the mob
max is a man with his back against the wall fighting a battle he cannot hope to wini would have to say that the story is well played out and the plot twist are cool
i also like some of the chracters max runs into  one of them is a russian bad guy who has some many morals and rules it almost makes him one of good guysif i could do some work to this game the only thing i would on is in some parts in the game i would like to work on the graphics a bit becuase cars are not what they could be and building might look a little better is some levels
but aside form that i have no probs with the game and i do plan on purchasing the seqaulnote you will love the slowmotioni rented this game but was not able to beat it in the short time span i had
i was able to hit in some codes and try out all the weapons so here goesover all the game is good with great action movie type visuals great gunexplosive effects and decnt cinematic scenes
the controls are hard to get used to though and will take about an hour or more of practice to even shoot straight
and where the game turns uglythe storyline and voice acting in this game is truly horrible
these  aspects really hurt the game
if you get this game i would skip past the stupid story sequences and just play
now that the game costs less i guess its worth buying but i would still recommend renting it and beating the game in that amount of time so you dont have to buy itmax payne and grand theft auto  in my opinion were the best games of the year and both were relased by rockstar
max payne has a chilling storyline and terrific graphics and gameplay
my only complaint was i really didnt like the controls on the game
i like games where you only have to use one analog stick instead of two but thats just me
that is why i gave max payne a  rather than a  other than that this is a great game and you should atleast rent it to see how you like it
the storyline and the awesome moves that max can make in the game make up for the controllingthis game is an excellent shooter has good graphics but it is too easy
i suggest renting it for a week so you can beat it and give it backnow that i have actually played and bought the game i can safely say tekken deserves the  stars i gave it
the gameplay is similar enought to t so that t players can jump right in
i found the new controls to be more user friendly than the four button and joystick scheme
i can finally pull off  hit combos and certain quickie moves
one thing i liked about the character roster  i was familiar with all of those characters two things no more eddy cheapo gordo
i wouldve liked to see true ogre julia chang and bryan fury
maybe therell be a sequel are you listening namcothis game is real fun to playespecially over and over againits fun and easy to play with great action and graphic design make this a must buy
i only gave it stars because it gets sort of boring but still funthis game is a d fighting game based around tekken  with  playable fighters xiaoyu yoshimitsu nina law gun jack hwoarang paul king and jin
with the playstation version of this fighting game for each character you beat the game with it will play a movie and you will earn a new playable fighter however it is not like this in the gameboy advance version
when you beat the game the credits roll and that is it you do not get any specialized ending nor an extra playable fighter
also heihachi is the leader of the game and not ogre like in tekken  heihachi may also be unlocked if you beat the game with all  fighters
this is a true d fighting game unlike street fighter and mortal kombat games with tekken advance the camera will zoom in and out of the battle as you fight also the fighter can move to a different angle to avoid attacks
the buttons are very simple having only a kick button a a punch button b and a close attack button r
with tekken the close attack would usually grapple your opponent and do a devastating move with tekken advance it performs a specific combo like a few punches or kicks
another great thing about this game are the modes of play such as arcade verses battle for two players time attack survival practice and even an incredible tag battle mode where you select  fighters then the computer will pit you against  random opponents
you can even tag out by pressing select to your different partners
the game even keeps track of the energy
all this being said the game has great graphics sound a unique d feel but not enough players or diversity to hold your interest more than a few monthsenjoyed the game play it frequently never gets old i you like gbs games this is a good one to getthat thisgame could be so good it has its downs but the ups out way the downsupsone of the best fighting gameshas law my fav
fightergraphicsall the different modesdownsonly  secret fighternot all the people from tekenso i think this really deserves a  for lack of fighters but it is still alot of bang for your buck but i would of paid an extra  to have all the fighters in itthis game really shows what the game boy advance can do
the characters on the game are just sprites from the original tekkens from playstation but they still look pretty good
its almost an exact port and the graphics and the scenery on the game will amaze you
you will hardly even know you are playing it on a game boy
the fighting system is great with really smooth controls and more
yet it doesnt introduce anything new to the tekken world hence the  star rating
nevertheless if you like fighting games especially tekken this is one you just cannot live withoutyes you basically only have three attack buttons
b for kick a for punch and r for throws so you can imagine that you wont be able to pull off as many combos in the arcade
but despite that its amazing how many of the regular characters moves are actually in the game
you can still do cheapo air combos play the hit and run game or just tap your opponent constantly to annoy him
characters included by default are paul nina yoshimitsu jin hwoarang king xiaoyu law and gun jack with heihachi as a boss
graphics wise its pretty good although you can expect it to be pixelatted
little worse looking than the original tekken for ps
youl also notice the game feels a bit more sluggish than the ps or arcade versions of tekken
takes some getting used to but youll probably eventually ignore this
it definitely doesnt have that smooth play feel like tony hawk
fun factor for this game
definitely a good port game for the tekken player whos got time before finals or long waits at airports
the average player or tekken haters probably might not like the game from the averagepixellated graphics or sluggish feeling controls at first
still though i loved the game being the tekken fan that i am and its nice to see my fav characters like jin and xiaoyu in a portable system
i just gotta wonder why in the world they included gun jack instead of eddie gordo
hed have been a better choiceits been said that its not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the the size of the fight in the dog
the same can be said for tadespite its smallish stature the game packs more than brawlers more than games x its size
although they wont floor you cmon its a  bit system for cryin out loud
the games graphics are just good enough to get the job done
the characters are recognizable and perform all the attacks they did in tekken  as if u didnt notice
you can also side step in d thanks to some nifty pseudo d effects
the game sounds greattoo
kicks and punches produce a satisfying thud while the thumping techno soundtrack provides the perfect musical accompaniment
all the familiar voices from kings roar to yoshimitus otherworldlycries are included too
on the down side the character roster is a bit skecthy where are eddy and law
and you need  copies of the game to play vs mode
still ta more than does the series justice and is a worthwhile diversion for those of us who are waiting on the ever anticipated tekken monster rancher  is quirky great looking and a ton of fun
the premise is simple enough you select a monster to take through training exercises building various attributes like speed and strength and then enter them into tournaments wear they duke it out with other monsters
several aspects of gameplay add depth to the basicsfirst off you can find different monsters on any cd or dvd
the game reads certain information from each disk you place in the ps and unlocks a corresponding monster for you to train
in other words all of your music movies and games unlock different monsters some of which are very rare
its also great fun when a disk you use unlocks a monster that seems to be associated with whatever the disk is try using a godzilla dvd or parappa the rapper or tenchu stealth assassins game for the ps one for example
youll get some amusing and rare monsters to trainyou can customize each of your charges as well
in addition to being able to buy the accessories like armor you select which attributes they should focus on in their training and which they should let atrophy
you can also set which techniques theyll be able to use in combatcombat is fast and furious
the tactics youll find the most success with are dependent on your monsters
big lumbering monsters are better played defensively waiting for that one slip up before they strike while speed demons can do well playing aggressively
youll fight in either round robin or elimination tournaments for prizes more cash for training and feeding your monster or certification to fight at the next highest tier
the game is not terribly difficult once you know what you are doing but it still tends to be funmr has good replay value since there are so many monsters to discover and train each with a unique personality and tactics
it can get a little stale from time to time since the routine changes only slightly
the multiplayer aspect of the game is also somewhat limited as it requires each player to spend time in the single player game training up a stable of monsters to compete against othe playersall in all a very good game that will capture your interest even if only for a little whilethis game is fun
there are new monsters to unlock the battle system is good and the story line is good too
but lolocking monsters can take a long time if you have alot of cds
and  thing i thought is really good once you unlock a monster there is a profile of which monsters you get and if a monster you really like dies you can unlock it for the profile
i kinda wish they didnt take out the phonix monster from moster racher for the power of the monster i suggest you power up 
life 
speed 
power
ive done best with the  things
over all the game is funi would have given this  stars but it has no way to breed the monsters together like you could in the first two gamesi love the new faster battles you seem to have much more control  and the graphics are almost perfect almost like you are watching a cartoon
about fighting monsters the only other thing i missed was not being able to bring monsters you had raised from the first two games over since the ps games cant access the ps card
i do like this very much thoughthis game is very realistic  if you think too long to answer the other players will vote you off  this happened to me during a tiebreaker   players left and everyone got  vote
strongest link had to decide who to vote off and since i voted for them they changed their voted and voted for me even though i wasnt the weakest but because i voted for them
i was impressed  if you think ann is intimidating on tv wait til you buy this game
everytime you choose the quotsingle playerquot she cracks how you dont have any friends to play with or if you pick the quotbend the rulesquot option she says quoti guess you do need to cheat to winquot  ltso funnygt  unlike other trivia games this one has  questions
so i heard  i played it and no repeats yet and even if you might see a repeat you have to be a real rainman to memorize all the answershowever this game needs online multiplayer
if it will in future editions this should challenge other game like you dont know jack as the best trivia game of all timeswhen i first got this game i didnt know if id like it
to tell the truth i find the real tv show rather insulting
but i have to admit ive gotten lots of hours of fun and entertainment from this
you have to leave your ego and seriousness at the door
at first i didnt like the personality selections they give you i usually play alone
they all seem a little screwy
but after i decided not to take myself seriously and started picking the various personalities i had a ball
i even tried the teenagers and members of the opposite sex just for a little variation
i did get a bit of a surprise when i was down to the final  and as the strongest link got voted off
it really irked me when anne came on and scolded me for not being too smart
like i said dont take yourself seriously with this game or you might as well as play something else
i also like playing the different levels
this cd is lots of fun and you dont find yourself answering the same questions over and over
lots of variations
go for it and have fun even if you end up the weakest link good byedoom is a great game
it was the most advanced of its time early s and probably the only really good game back then
however this collectors edition box really is nothing
in the box one doom collectors edition cd
thats it
there is nothing else in there but the box
no certificate although the paper in the case labeling it quotdoom collectors editionquot has a number on it but it is barely noticeable
however if you have never played doom and want to experience then buy it
it has extra chapters that are not found on the shareware version
meh but i returned it and got black and white instead
the cd only holds  megs of data and can run on my amd k   mhz with a sis  integrated graphics chipset with  megs of shared grafix ram
good game bad packagedoom was the most famous game of the early ninties
games such as heretic and duke nukem could not beat it then and still not nowdoom collectors edition is perfect for getting the games that made legend and is only  dollars at most stores
however if you never liked doom this collection wont do a thing to change your mind
includes the ultimate doom doom ii and the fanmade final doom
recommendedwhat more can doom offer
in this bundle not much but just incase you missed the doom craze back in    here is the plot of it
you are a lone soldier sent out on a first person shooter to annihilate creatures goat headed demons imps zombie soldiers and huge cybernetic spider masterminds
so what do you get with this collectors bundle
all of the official doom releases starting with the ultimate doom which is the original  levels of doom plus an extra tough  additional levels
then when you defeat that move on to doom  which is  levels with new monsters such as the chain gunners pain elementals and the arch vile and others but still the same old weapons and graphics
the levels are incredibly detailed with s of new wall textures where you actually believe you are in a city slum overrun by monsters and you go to the lair of the monsters to destroy the big bad bosses
finally included on the single cdrom that comes in this bundle is final doom
most doom players missed out on this because it was an expansion pack released for doom  which contains  new levels
however they are nothing you should go running to it just adds to the longevity and difficulty of doom
this bundle is pretty bad especially when it comes in a box and not a single jewel case because everything is on a single cdromthis game pack saddly to say is incompleat it doesnt include final doomthat is why i give it  stars instead of final doom was released about  years ago in limited quantities and if it had been part of this pack it would be a  true collectors edition
if you get this pack try to find the final doom to have the compleat doom seriesmaybe write to activision to get them to release a true collectors setok this is quite simple i first played doom and doom  when they came out all those years ago and i was hooked from the word go
over the years
like many i suspect i misplaced the original disks and recently decided to play the games again as in a few months i will be able to play doom one of the things i remember about the doom series is the music
it set a great atmosphere
on playing this particular format i noticed that the music had changed
in the configuration i was only able to set the number of channels for the game music sound effects etc
there was no way to select the appropriate sound card option ie ad lib sound blaster or pc speakerthe game instead comes with this horrible very un tributery old bit like sound that you cannot associate with a sound card
not only that but on opening the box all i actually saw were two disks in a plastic case
ok it only cost me  dollars but i would at least expect to find some form of manual
for this reason i cannot give this version the five stars that it deserves for being a real masterpeice of a d shooteri do not recommend this one to anyone unless they are prepared to either listen to the music that this game offers or like me are prepared to go without musicdoom was and still is a great game
you get all the orginal dooms on the cd
a warning to you windows xp users the mouse wil not work
  i highly recomend getting it
you will need the wads on the cdi only have one bad thing to say about the bundle  you dont get any of the cd tracks that came with the orginal doomon the good side  im having more fun playing it than i did doom
i know it sounds crazy but it is true
doom just had better level designers behind itall in all if you played the orginal doom i would recommend getting this just for kicksdark age of camelot daoc provides a very different mmorpg experience for those seeking one
i played everquest for years and had grown quite comfortable with the leveling structure experience amp combat systems and difficulty
because you could just as easily find a spec chart and description of the game somewhere else im going to compare daoc to everquest for those players considering buying daocplussescamp times are almost nonexistant
while down time certainly exists theres almost no quotwaiting for repopquot time like there constantly was in everquest
rare spawns and perms respawn within a reasonable amount of time throughout the game never taking longer than two or three hours at the most compared to oh say the raster camp from eqaverage of 
 hours
twinking is impossible
one of daocs unique features is assigning a level to all of the items in the game
items too high level for your character will not give you their maximum benefits and will degrade much faster thereby preventing people from handing down gratuitously good equipment to their lower level characters
because items are only useful within a  level range above or below daocs economy will remain much more stable than everquests for a long time
instead of hunting in a dungeon to get loot that sells to players half your level you go into a dungeon and get loot thats better than what youre usingthe quest system is much more user friendly
a built in journal tracks your progress and next step and the quests are fun and much more engaging than the average eq quest where most of your time was spent camping some monsterthe classes are infinitely more balanced than in everquest
ive only played in the realm of albion but within albion every class has its strengths and weaknesses which manage to balance each other out
theres also a lot more variety between individual characters of the same class every level you are awarded quotspec pointsquot which can be used to increase specific skills your character usesthe player versus player system is for the most part excellent
theres an appropriate battleground for every level so you can pvp without fear of being victimized by people twice your level
teamwork pvp is intense engaging and absolutely necessary because daoc rewards you in pve for being effective in pvp
players can also choose whether or not to participate in pvp the game never requires it and you can go for pretty much the entire game without worrying about it if you so chooseminusesyou level really quickly compared to everquest
while some might consider this a good thing it makes the overall amount of game time much smaller
players have gone from level  minimum to  maximum within a period of a couple weeks of dedicated play whereas a similar level jump in everquest would take months possibly yearsthe game is incomplete and more is added slowly via patches
while this may discourage many people it shouldnt as all mmorpgs function this waythis is real fun but one thing i do not like about this game the weapons after a while are junk and you have to get another weaponive been playing morrowind for the xbox for weeks now and i think im getting close to the halfway mark on the gamethe games world is huge and theres just too many quests and objectives aside from the main quest that can be sought outthe game has an extensively huge amount of roleplaying topic context material and text information in npcs and booksthe games magic system is relatively good for rpgs with seven schools of magic and a near infinite amount of premade spellshowever that you can make your own custom spells truly makes for a wizard character that is truly unique and top notchthe games thieving system is also incredible as you can steal just about any item in the game hope you dont get caughtnow that thats said i need to point out a few of morrowinds down sides  and they may be dealbreakers for new buyersfirst off the combat in the game is rudimentary and overly simplified consisting of repeated attacks until the enemy fallssecond off morrowind takes quite a bit of time to save and load taking up to two minutes to load a large save gamethird morrowind tends to crash with dirty disc errors quite often after the save file reaches  blocks or larger andreaching  blocks will not take you very long despite any efforts you may employ to reduce the saves file sizealso note that the dirty disc errors dde have nothing to do with the physical condition of your morrowind game discmorrowind will often either freeze or crash with the dde message whenever the game tries to load more than the xboxsfinite available  megabytes of ram and these crashes will happen often so buyer beware on this pointat this point in time no workaround fix or xbox patch is available from either microsoft or bethesda softworksunfortunately noone has thought of the gamer and come up with a pc cd burn application with a xbox game patch on it yetthe morrowind game of the year edition is set to be released in the fall of  so i would recommend waiting for the updatehopefully the updated version of the game will be more crash proof or come with a built in game save file fixer optioni love rpgs
i dont know this should have been made open ended thoughi mean it is literally impossible to kill people unless you have huge stats or a great weapon
unless you have the almost  page strategy guide this game is a toughie
the graphics are nice the music and sound is awesome
the fighting just disappoints though you have to get a sword real close to get anybody
it gets really frustrating although i always want to keep playing i just dont know why
great game overalli ordered it from amazon my favorite online store and thought it was awesome
the first few hours of play is kinda boring but after awhile youll be like sweet i just leveld up
and have alot of fun
im a fan of open ended gameplay like this and its a must have for any rpg fan
you get to travel across the island of morrowind exploring killing thieving or causing trouble
best elder scrolls yet
it lets you choose your race wich verys from argonian to orc
each race has different abillities
you can join groups or guilds like the mages guild theives guild and the fighters guild
overall this game is fun
pretty long and complicated but the vast land and exploring is very fun
buy this gamei was told that xbox would be a console for console type games
both halo and morrowind prove that xbox is the dreaded dumping ground for pc type games
depending on your perspective this can be either good or badi have mixed feelings about morrowind
it has some interesting elements to it but its mouse amp keybord style controls similar to halo are a serious annoyance as are its overly complex character creation and game play mechanics
i think this is as close as it gets to a perfect translation of a pen and paper rpg to a console game as it gets
this strength is also a weakness
it can take hours to generate a character
im also upset that we have so few options with how the character would look
our options are hideous to ugly
there are not enough options and no matter what you do your character will be pretty darn unattractive
for as elaborate as the rest of the game is this aspect of the game is a sore disappointment
i had no problem establishing a character as a quothottiequot in segas phantasy star onlinethe game is unusual for a quotconsolequot rpg
it takes place in a first person perspective something im not sure i like
its interesting and bearable but maybe im just used to playing console rpgs in the vein of final fantasythe graphics of this game vary
the water in this game is simply amazing the scenery is intricate and detailed the character models are mediocre however and there is one major complaint i have with the title horrendous load time
i thought the xbox was supposed to be the fastest
this game will show you why nintendos data streaming technique and minidvd is a much smarter choice
id like to see this game using data streaming technology because it would drastically cut down the seemingly hours of load time
however unlike past pclike console rpgs summoner for ps  come to mind this game makes it worth it to sit through the loading and actually has game play tips and hits which are very helpful during loading sequencesas a hardcore rpg fan i found this game to be quite enjoyable despite my complaints and would definitely recommend this game for console players wanting to test the waters of a more pc oriented game or hardcore rpg fans who want something that is unnecessarily overly complex
the games complexity will woo some gamers but will surely scare others
i strongly suggest renting the game before you buy iti love rpgs role playing games
ive played all sorts of them from straightforward games like zelda ocarina of time where there is a linear story to games like the final fantasy series where you are free to explore on your ownto an extentnow we have morrowind where there is no linear story and you are free to do as you please
this is a mixed blessingat the beginning of the game you are to choose what your character will be
there are a dozen or so races to choose from like elves or nordsmen
eventually you must also choose which sign constellation you will be and what skills you want to have
this was all overwhelming to me because i want to make the best character for the game but i have no idea what is a good skill to have or what a lot of the stuff meansthe controls are also rather poor theyre almost reverse to every other game released thus far on the xbox and the option screen offers very little customization
but all this stuff is just a nuisance compared to the scale of the gamethis game is huge it has epic proportions
you can do whatever you want you can choose to be a good guy and chase down outlaws you can be a bad guy and become a thief you can even spend all your time up in the hills killing monsters and living off the land
you can join all sorts of guilds you can work on specific skills you have the all the freedom in the worldif you want to buy a game that will distract you for weeks to come then this is the game for you
it is not intended as a rental or a game that you pick up for an hour every once in a while
you can play as once character for a month and if you want to start a new character now you know what all these classes and skills mean and you can play it againeach character you create will be different and thus you will never play the same game twice
this game is just too huge to explain
i wish i could play it now but im at work
my advice to you is go get this gameimagine the ability to play a game the way you want to
not to have to follow the stupid pointless storyline
not to have to go this way or that way
imagine free will
well you dont have to imagine anymore
morrowind is the best openended rpg that i have played yet
all other openended rpg always endud up incorperating some main mission into the plot of possible ventures
not morrowind it does though  give you that option
i enjoy morrowind because of the ability to start over after my th time and still be able to say ohhh ive never been that classracesexguildthe pure scope of this game is amazing
you have a huge land to explore filled with tombs caves swamps castles etc
in your travels you have the chance to obtain and master an enormous amount of weapons and magic spells
i have never played a game that is more allencompassing or complex
despite all this i do have  criticisms
when you get killed it takes a looong time to upload a new game
if you are fighting a particularly tough character and get killed multiple times this can get fairly oldtoo much talking 
this game is a little too cerebral and a little low on action
you can spend hours just talking to the hundreds if not thousands of characters trying to gain information about your surroundingsif you like a game that requires strategy and patience this game if for you
if you like nonstop action you will find this game rather slowfor anyone whos ever thought about a combination of two great games into one greater i always had an idea as of recently
take the sheer massiveness and incredibly detailed world of shenmue use its complete sense of freedom of going into any building and examining just about anything and everything in sight sprinkle in the vigilante factor of grand theft auto  with the ability to kill and maim at will and whatd you end up with
well it certainly wouldnt be elder scrolls but what youd see here in morrowind is the next closest thing of freedom in gaming historyin the medieval land of morrowind you are nothing more than a lowly prisoner captured and released into the world as a freeman after a journey across the sea
and after those first steps outside the seaports door the world is at your fingertips
live the life of a noble dispatching thieves and bandits and serving the empire
or be a thief murder shop keepers and civilians at will steal items from their home and sell them off to afford more weapons and armour
with the possible exception of grand theft auto  and shenmue ive never played a game this free beforebeing able to venture off on your own without following the storyline and diving into hundreds of sidequest and finding hidden caves and bandit camps is morrowinds biggest strength
within the first  minutes of my game i had already found a cave of bandits freed their slaves and swam into a lake finding the remains of a skeleton at the bottom where i found a sword and gold pieces next to his bodyyour character is chosen from ten classes of races from dark elves wood elves orcs and humans
the faces hair and sex can be altered though shallow does make for a nice variety in at least making your character seem somewhat customized to your liking once chosen you also are given the ability to generate choose or even create a classprofession
this ranges from warriors knights crusades thief mages and many others
choosing a class gives players a certain abilities the others work without knights and crusaders can wield heavy weapons from hammers to doublesided axes
while thieves and assassins can be deadly striking in stealth and small daggersthe entire game plays similar to drakan the ancients gates your character can be viewed from st and rd person points of view
along the empty dirt roads beasts and enemies will be encountered along the way killing so many increases your characters attributes depending on what method is used stealth strength magic ect
outside of towns you can camp to regain your health and pass time
the weather will constantly change from misted mornings to rainy nights and even heavy thunderstorms with lightning crashing overhead
if youre not fond of travelling such vast distances on foot hitch a ride on a mammoth insectlike creature to the next village it costs money but takes no time to travel
decisions decisionsthe elder scrolls series has been a phenomenal success on the pc and after reading the features for morrowind during my purchase i was sceptical as to the notion go anywhere do anything gameplay
of course it didnt take me long to realize they meant it
morrowind is a great rpg that no xbox owner should be without
not only is it massive and seemingly endless in its production but its also a lot of fun
a musthave titlei encountered a lot of freezing especially toward the end of the game when the save files got up into the  block range
maybe im just used to playing pc games though cause the freezing really didnt bother me all that much and cause the rest of morrowind is so incredibly coolphrases like openended get thrown around a lot in reference to games
this game was the first one ive ever played where i truly felt the description fitocean between you and where you want to be
swim across
or get a waterwalking spell
or create your own enchanted waterwalking item
or buy a waterwalking potion
or go forage for the ingredients in the forest and make the potion yourselffrankly the game world is so massive so detailed and so interesting and the story so compelling that i can easily forgive some crashesthere are of course some things that bethesda could do better the next time aroundfor instance despite the fact that the game has a fantastic daynight simulation and weather generator you can actually watch a morrowind sunrise and the moons have different phases at different points in the month nobody but you ever sleeps
stores are open for  hours every day
also within each town most of the people you meet only give you the same information as all the other people in that town
loading games takes a relatively long time as does saving toward the end of the game
and npcs do occasionally get bumped around or disappear entirely
luckily none of these things affected my quest but i can imagine getting pretty frustrated if id put a week or two into this game and dagoth ur wasnt where he was supposed to be at the endall in all though this is well worth the  youll drop on it its easily got  hours worth of playabilityi bought this because i loved games like knights of the old republic and such where you have to use your brain and stradegy
games you have to explore to find more not just walse thru a level blasting pixels
this game gets some sick reviews
most love it so i thought its a sure thing
well its defineatly bigin fact its too bigand very complicated
for the die hard gamer that has the patience to put about  of their brain function to getting into this game and also their regular life
this is your game for a guy with a life or with only about  hours a day to play if he chooses forget about it
this game is huge its a monster its very detailed and has allot of coverage
but
its also very difficult to get into and once you do you might want to have a notebook next to you because theres allot to do and you need to keep everything organized or you will be lost
i have played it for a hot minute and everytime i do i really want to get into it but its so big and slow that i gt discouraged
buy if you are really a hardcore gamer with the patience to watch a turtle race for a mileas has been said morrowind is massive immersive and all that
in this review i want to simply warn you about what happens next
you have to be like me and take it to a level at which you can conquer at will and then switch to a completely different character or else your interest may fall off a cliffmorrowind now leaves me cold
i dont know
i think some of it has to do with me living a bit less hermetically than when i first bought it
also i think that i like a bit more skill based playing
when i finally got my hands on metal gear solid the contrast was clear
skill development in morrowind is painstaking and slow
the arsenal is too large
morrowind is very much like life
the range of skills is enormous
you can only guess how long it will take you to master them and you dont really know if that is the thing that will bring you success but you try it anyway
you are invested because of the time you really build a self in morrowindi mean clearly you need to be able to kill the various sentries and guards in order to progress to the level implied in the game but it would take at least  months of game playing to reach that levelin the middle of playing as a nightblade basically the equivalent of an auror in the harry potter series  a killer of evil mages i suddenly got interested in alchemy
so here im developing the skills so that i can be a good thief and short swordsman and political being all so that i can get lots of money to buy powerful potions and charms and i discover that an alchemist with just a few tools can go around picking mushrooms and make their own
so i sell all my weapons and go picking flowers and looking for books with recipes
but clearly no matter what i do i cant get my alchemy skill level up to parswitching play styles in the middle of a game is an enormous and interesting challenge and it made the game more worthwhile to me but the character you choose will have some hard limits
they do some fairly interesting things with genetic predispositions in morrowind
its very nicely balanced though
there are obviously many approaches to the same problemsbut either way it takes a virtual eternityso the deal is get into it deeply and when you have the hang of it switch to a new character and start over
this will double your pleasure
but then finally you will be sick of it and wonder how you spent all that time on the gamethis game is great simply because you control you own destiny noting is preplanned
it takes a few days to get use to the controller
i have been playing all summer and have not even started the main quest
i strongly suggest if you get this game you purchase the morrowind guide with all the maps
the game also has a great support web site in which you can get a lot of quest questions answered through a forum
i should warn you this game is geered more for adults not because of content but more that it merits a good attention span for maximum enjoymentthe character creation system is one of the first things you will encounter in morrowind and it gives a glimpse at how openended and complex a game this is
be sure to take time creating a character because this character will be with you for hundreds of hoursin my first attempt i used one of the prepackaged character classes
while this gave me a good base character the problem was that i had a very specific idea of how i wanted to play this game and the character that id created didnt perfectly fit this style of play
as a result even in the beginning the game was extremely difficult and frustrating
advancing levels was slow combat was overly challenging and i spent a good deal of time staring at loading screens rather than playing the gameafter reading a little about the character abilities and descriptions i realized that i was missing certain features that i would need to play the game the way i had intended as a roguemage
by starting over again i was able to use the knowledge id gained to create a new bettersuited character
the game changed dramaticallywith this new character levelling up was easier i could do all the things that i wanted to do and see the character improving at them
this changed the dynamics of the game completely
i could now explore this huge world with less fear of constant death i could advance in the guilds id chosen to join because my abilities were better suitedwhile morrowind has some ingame problems framerate jitters an abundance of fetch quests by far the biggest problem is the lack of documentation and a lack of direction for novice players
if you know what youre getting into is a huge openended role playing game in which you can do virtually anything from slaughter entire villages to spend all day making healing potions or bribing the local townsfolk then morrowind will definitely satisfybut be sure this is what you want or youll quickly find yourself in over your headmorrowindmany many hoursmonths of play and replaythings have come a long way since zork but not much furtherthan the unreal engine
this was my impression after playingmorrowind for about  hours straight
after reading aboutthe technical problems people were having with the pc versioni wasnt surprised to see the details on characters a bit moresimplistic than halo
however the backgrounds and weaponeffects are top notchthis is the kind of game i had hoped for when buying the xbox
iwanted to play pc type games on a console morrowind certainlydelivers
ive played and put away obi wan amped gotham doagun v batman nightcaster and legends but have only replayedhalo
morrowind is so open ended i expect to play this one forthe rest of the summerthe island is big enough for me to spend a day real time walkingfrom one end to the other
the mapping and inventory work muchnicer than similar games played in the past
spell casting is difficultwhen fighting multiple opponents because you need to hit the movingopponents with your crosshairs
the occasional invinciblecharacter is a bit frustrating and my only wish for a future releaseis a more sophisticated ai
i found myself in a room with twofriendly characters and a third came along and attacks only me thefriendlys just sort of stood and watched this is after i helped them killthe monsters that were attacking them
hey cmon return the favorkudos to bethesda softworks for releasing such an ambitious gamewith infinite replayability
i hope this is the tip of the iceburgthis is my first game review ive ever done
well lets get started
if you like snowboarding then this is the game for you
amped also has a variety of boarders including you if you want to create your own player
there is another cool thing that i like about this game and thatssponsors
if you trick off of height for the media you get media points
if you get the needed amount then you earn a sponsor
do what they like best to leave them amped
this isnt some sort of game where you are a snowboarding bunny tricking over carrots
its a real game
amped is rated e for mild lyrics
get it soon and i mean soon
the next game review that i will do will be for a game that i have for xbox and that is nfl fever  email me if you have any questions or need some codesthis is a very good xbox game
before i bought amped i wasnt sure if i should get it or ssx tricky instead so i spent some time asking around and reading reviews to make my determination
i knew ssx tricky would be a safe bet from the sheer amount of acclaim it has received since its first incarnation when the ps first came out but i was more interesting in ampeds realistic approach to snowboarding
my only concern was whether amped was really a good game because in the end that is all that really matterswell amped is a really good game and im glad that i decided on it over ssx not that i think ssx is a bad game
amped is actually better than i had hoped it would be and that in itself makes it worth the purchase
the graphics are as good as you expect and the playability is even betterthere is a bit of a learning curve
when you first start out its much like real snowboarding in that you have to learn how to do it
this can be a big downside to people with no patience to learn a game and may explain why people recommend getting tony hawk a game that will have you doing big tricks in the first two minutes over this
im not a hardcore gamer and it probably took me up to an hour of playing before i felt like i was really able to play the game
but ill admit at first i wasnt sure if id ever be able to play this game expect to do a lot of falling at firstthe game does reward you for your patience
the first mountain has very low score requirements so even those that fall halfway down the run can still pass and earn skill points
before you know it youll be on the third or fourth mountain and youll be coming back to the first to compete against new unlocked scenarios wracking up scores four or five times higher than when you initially started out
this really gives you the feeling of what its like to work your way from an ametuer to a pro
and that is what this game does bestunfortunately the game rewards your developing skills with progression towards seemingly impossible runs
youll be working your way along fine impressed with yourself at how good youve actually become at the game wracking up scores you never thought possible only to come to a challenge that you cannot pass
then youll play harder because youll remember that youve thought this way before and look where you are now
and maybe youll pass the challenge but you will come to one that you cant pass
well maybe if youre a hardcore gamer you might but few people will be able to beat this game
im halfway through and im stuck
and im frustratedi sure had a lot of fun getting to where i am and you will too
i still have fun playing this game even if i cant finish career mode and so will you if you at least have the patience of a gnat
but to me level progression is always the worst thing about games of this type because inevitably most gamers run into the level they cannot pass
fortunately this doesnt really happen on amped until late in the game
still if amped had a smoother and less ridiculously difficult level progression this game would have been a five star gamei think its okay but it isnt the best game
i think dark summit is much more funner this ampedi got to about the th course from the end and the sponsor was ridiculousthe create a player function is good
although the clothing looks much the samegameplay is tight with good controls
we are talking snowboarding here though and its bound to get a little repetitive
i had a lot of fun with this game for a solid monththis isnt a bad title to begin with especially for the xgamer in your familythis game was a good game and i love snowboarding even more now
i like how you have scout people look at your tricks and stuff but over all i would say this game is in the top  for x box halo is obviously number 
it would be a smart thing by the producers if they came out with amped  because lots of people love snowboaring if you love snowboarding buy this game and if you dont well then atleast rent it
you will be surprised
great gamei really enjoyed playing this gamethe graphics and the music is really coolthere are a lot of different things that you can do on this gameplay this game for surei recently bought an xbox and am slowly building up my game collection
i had a demo of quotampedquot and loved it
however i found quotampedquot for a good price and thought i would try it
i must say that it is fantastic and very addictive
there are quite a lot of controls to learn to really do well on high scores but it is a lot of fun learning to play
the hardest part for me is the rails
with a limited budget i have to start with some of the older games and this one is well worth the money
it is hilarious to try a front flip and end up landing on your head
great gamethis game is pretty cool
it uses the xboxs soundtrack feature lets you rip music cds and listen to them during the game and has well over  places to go freestyle snowboarding
it has a multiplayer for up to four people you dont even have to have four controllers to play four player
after you input the names you can all share a single controller or two because it lets you board in turns not at the same timeit also lets you customize your boarder with many many accessories such as dragon clothesif you like snowboarding games this is a must haveif you buy this game you will not be let down
however you may not complete the game either
the freestyle play of this game is entirely enjoyable
the big air and the flips are outstanding and in an odd way relaxing
the game itself isnt as tight as far as interface as lets say project gotham and that is why this one probably wasnt bundledthe rails aspect of gameplay will surely frustrate you
and as the title of the review states you will hit a level  of the way through that you cannot pass as it requires jumping from rail to rail with a sponsor disapproving as you flounder in vain trying to catch these rails
i believe its the slopey slope run in japan where this occurs
the snow boarder tends to get tangled on the rails or in a tree if he doesnt hit the rail at just the precise moment
looks like a little sloppy or extraneous coding from the programmersthis is also the only game that the xbox sometimes does not recognize right away
but these are minor things and you are probably a better gamer than me so let me say this is a solid purchasethis game felt to me like learning to snowboard for real at first
it can be very frustrating and will take several hours just to get the hang of the controls
as you progress the challenges are set up so that you can almost pull them off  of the time but take persistance to beat them
some challenges took me over an hour and im only half way through the game
the system of progressing is very taunting so are the spectators in the game which makes you want to beat the next challenge
i have had times where i felt like smashing the controller in frustration on some levels but that made it feel that much better when i beat it
there are also a few weird occurences with the physics getting stuck and being told quotgo downhillquot sometimes when you already are but not enough to spoil the game
i gave this  stars because although i love playing it i think the frustrating toughness of this game may not be enjoyable for some people
i recommend it for gamers who like snowboarding whether you do it in real life or not and gamers that want a challenging game
another great feature is that this game lets you play your own music mixes a plus because the included music gets old after a while
also the graphics are great
very close to real lookingwhen i bought nightcaster i was expecting some type of gauntlet game built to take advantage of the advanced xbox hardware
well my expectations were partially correctthis is a pure actiongauntlet type of game but it doesnt quite play the same way and this is both good and bad but in the end the game turned out pretty good for the priceyoure given a great deal of freedom and your tasks usually involve wiping out enemies and enemy generators a la gauntlet and occassionally you get to take part in small questlike tasks
where nightcaster differs from gauntlet is the attack system
although you have a wand you can use as a rather ineffective melee weapon you will ultimately live and die by the manabased spellbook system
four classifications of spells are yours and you cast them using the orb which you control with a separate aiming thumbstick thereby allowing independent movingfiring movement similar to robotron
a unique system but much different than what i expected when i bought the gameany downsides to this
yes there are plenty
you have to choose your spells correctly for the area or situation youre in as certain spell classes are strongerweaker or ineffective on certain enemies
the enemies are quite fast and youll often find yourself retreating like crazy and switching spells on the fly in order to take them out
the save point system is just like resident evil and that  enemies frequently fade out even though they are relatively close to you only to reappear behind you for no apparent reason
and the camera system is rather constricting since you can never seem to move it to just the right angle
there are other problems but i feel the game is quite good despite the issues and youll find yourself enjoying it if you give it a chancethis is a first generation xbox product so you have to overlook some of the shortcomings
from a technical standpoint the game is done well and youll find yourself pushing on to finish the it
should you buy it
given the low price id say yesif your a fan of magic andor gauntlet you will love this game
it has a great flow and interesting attack system i only rented but it could be a game i buy in the near future for it was fun to play and not just a simple hack and slash game also there is a complex story behind and learning it will become a challenge in itself
great gameplay and graphics very enjoyable for the right kind of fanthis game is really good
ive been looking for this game forever
it has great effects and magic and the button use is really good and the controls are fabthe game moves a little slow but if you put the time in youll like the gamewell i like it
this game is making my mouth water for elder scrollsmorrowind
the story reminds me of zelda
i hope vr does not forget night caster because i really like it and it left me wanting more
also if you rush through night caster you will not beat it youll miss a lot and it will get old
this is a combination of zelda and gauntlet legends and i think it is very good because vr took gauntlet legends and gave all that boring same repeating fighting a real purpose
for fast action amp challenging gameplay id buy itwell i bought this game on  and i have to say its pretty cool 
the spells affects look great and there is plenty of enemies
the world that you are in is awsome looking with real looking trees
this game is very hard though and the enemies come at you in packs
i like this game
its differnta fun and colorful game that luckily landed on xboxthe title says it all
because this is a special game
it is highly recomended
there are few if any now that i think about it flaws in this game
it is highly recomendedssx is a fantastic game that clearly shows how far games have progressed throughout the years
ssx is an example of why we should be playing games in the first place  fun
the world you are set in is colorful and vivid strewn with fireworks displays and sharp turns
the real beauty of the game lies in the animation and smooth transitions that the characters make while performing their overthetop tricks and spins
if people could perform these quotuberquot tricks ssx gives a good representation of what they would look like
the audio also plays a big part in the games overall feel and flavor
each boarder has an individual persona that is voiced by a celebrity lending much more well character to each character
the music is mostly comprised of techno beats that change their tempo and volume depending on your characters actions
ssx is a great game for pure entertainment and is a fantastic game for your xboxwow
this game amazed me alot when it came out beccause i thought doom 
so i decided to try this one
i was impressed greatly
the only reason i didnt give it a  is because of its graphics
they could have been better
the weapons also were not that amazing
there were only like  or  weapons
i was dissapointed at that
but despite that everything else seems good
this game has plenty of levels like  or something
i am on level  its way too hard already
i cant imagnine the last level
one thing i didnt get about this game is when you kill a enemy there is green blood
i dont value that too much
i wish that it looked more real
anyway the levels are great with great monsters in them
the music is sort of weird and the sound effects arent that great but i can cope with that
there are  different levels of how easy it is or how hard it is
there is three ways that you can start
the multiplayer mode is awesome
i dont know why it was rated teen
this game seems more on the line of mature
great game with a good amount of faults but not real bad faults let me just say quotwowquot  i cant believe they fit doom into a gba format
if youve played the game in the olden days then youd know how much a nostalgic experience it is when you play this
it was fun then and it is fun now especially being about to hook up gbas and play deathmatch or coop
slight problems like how pixlated the enemy gets at a distance
the sound from the original game has seem to have ported over well
the music which i cant really remember from the pc version is fine
the controls are the best for what you can do for a gba
good game good funif youre a fan of the doom series you get exactly what youve wanted  no more no less
the game boy advance continues to impress in the graphics arena tony hawk  was the first indication and the port is pretty darn true to the original doom
somewhat grainy visuals direct from the original game and very basic gameplay bring the game down a notch but its still as fun as everif you were a fan of the original or want to see what really started the quakes unreal tournaments and counter strikes of the world get this gamethis game is funit might not be a exact portbut its still good because its handheldeverything different is listed hereno cyber demonno spider mastermindemtower of babelis remadegreen bloodthe face has no animation when hurt unless from sidesemfortress of mysteryname becomes ems namedisother than thatnothing is missingif you want to try the old days of doomput this into a game boy playeradmit it you never thought youd ever see doom or any first person shooter for that matter on a handheld and certainly not on the gameboy but what we have here is one hell of a game for the gba
the graphics are a bit dated and the enemies look like ants from a little bit away but this fast paced action shooter is a surprisingly solid gba title
i only hope the upcoming gba conversion of wolfenstein d is as good or betteri have played many dd video games like pool of radiance ruins of myth drannor icewind dale icewind dale ii and heart of winter expansion pack for icewind dale
i played for a little bit baldurs gate dark alliance on the gameboy advance and i was very disappointed because it only had one character to play throughout the whole story
it wasnt a whole party of  or  no my friend it was a lonely character with no help at all from anybody trying to solve the whole problem for the city of baldurs gate
but anyway when i saw baldurs gate dark alliance for the ps yes i know its  and im still playing ps games and not xbox  or ps or wii games but you must admit that the ps slim console is one of best consoles of all time
its slick slim and sexy
plus it has a dvdcd player so you can play your favorites
where do you see that on an xbox or xbox 
plus it is much more easy to find ps games at almost any store at a price of  and below
where do you find xbox games in 
nowhere
you know why
because it sucks
the xbox is a freaking fat ass monster
nobody wants an xbox ps slim still selling baby
after all these years its still sellingive just started my quest through the world of baldurs gate and im loving every minute of it
i played for three hours solid the other day and the time went by quite quickly
for those who used to gather in the family den multisided die at the ready this will bring back good timesthe adventure is a great fusion of dd and gauntlet
fairly easy to pick up darn hard to put down
its similar to the diablo experience but unique in its own way too
theres monsters to be slain gold to be discovered and experience points to garner along the way
spread out those points as youll need a host of skills along the way
ive only played the solo adventure thus far but am looking forward to teaming up soon
rpg fan or not spend some time inside baldurs gate and i guarantee youll be hookedmy year old and i are playing together and are nearly finished with the gamethe interface accomodates two players quite well in most places but there are a couple areas  puzzle levels in particular  where its hard enough for one to get through much less two so we end up intentionally killing off one of the characters so that the other character can get through the puzzle
this is no problem since the second character can be easily resurrected at the next save point which is usually no more than a couple minutes awayas other reviews have mentioned da plays very much like diablo ii with the ability to increase skills as the players levels increase
the skills and feats mentioned deviate somewhat from rd edition dnd but that doesnt detract from the games funthe graphics are gorgeous
on one level in particular the floors are marble and have a sheen that reflects the player characters as well as the flicker of the torchesthe game is not flawless however
my biggest complaint is that i think they zoomed out too far from the action
in our two player game were zoomed out so far that i sometimes have trouble differentiating between my character and my sons
another complaint is that you never pick up anything useable from the creatures you defeat
almost without exception everything i picked up was sold back in town for more useful gear
even the rewards that are bestowed upon the characters for completing quests werent worth usingall in all though this is a really fun game
we play almost every single night and the game has held both our interestsbetter than the first because the enemies are harder to kill and theyre more interesting too
especially the three at the endthis game is fun
period
although it has been compared to diablo and diablo ii that is not a bad thing
i think that the only reason it gets compared to those two great games is because it shares some of the same elments and mechanics
you are given a choice of three character classes get info from the townspeople and embark on various quests to rid them of their troubles
the story is a good one if a bit predictable
the graphics are sharp and well donethe area in which this game shines is the gameplay
the controls are smooth and the response time is lightning fast no lag or anything of the like
i also like the fact the the controls are user friendly and the ingame tutorial is great at getting you familiar with the controls without being overly preachy or condescentingthe overall story is very linear and as you progress through the levels the enemies can be quite tough and sometimes downright difficult to deal with
the boss battles are cool and take quite a bit of strategy and evasion to ensure your survival
these above facts are cool and fit well into the game but they are also its downfall
although the toughness and tenacity of the enemies increases steadily your character is a bit slower to catch up
once you kill all the enemies on a level they dont respawn so you cannnot stick around and kill them again to gain more experience and level up fasterother than the fact that the difficulty level gets a little frustrating you have to deal with a little bit of boredom and a lull in the storyline towards the end of the game
the setup is nice but the ending leaves a little to be desireddont let those two little pitfalls disuade you from your quest this game is still a ton of fun and easy to master the only thing that counts against it are the two minor problems that could use a little bit of tweakingminor flaws but nothing to weigh too heavily
i highly suggest that fans of the diablo series and fans of dungeons and dragons buy this game
i also suggest that you purchase this game if you just want to spend a few hours chopping monsters to bits and blasting away at the minions of darkness with some well placed arrows or magical spellsanyone that played the dd card game or the dd pc series will thoroughly enjoy this game
you can choose between  characters human archer dwarf warrior or elf wizard and later a secret character
you follow rpg tasks fight everything in your way til you find something then bring it back to whomever wants it  but the average hack and slash player will enjoy it for the continuous fighting
there are many ways to improve your characters when you go up a level and the  player cooperative option feature means double the destruction
its a straight forward game with a map that draws itself in as you move so there is no getting lost in the dungeon
grab a friend and fight zombies skeletons lizard men and many others together
replay value is top notch
i didnt give it  stars because the rpg aspect improving your characters traits can be bit overwhelming for inexperienced players
players new to the story will not know that blunt disruption weapons clubs or maces are better at killing off the living dead than swords or that certain upgrades are best suited to a specific character
its all part of the learning curve but youll enjoy it none the lessthis is a fun entertaining game with lots of action but not a lot of variety
basically youre doing the same thing over and over hacking and slashing
has a diablo kind of feel to it as many reviewers have stated so if youre expecting this to be like baldurs gate for the computer you might be dissapointedgreat feature is that you can play two players at the same time adding to the fun
my brother and i played through it in four days so its not particularly challenging but it was engaging and quite addictivethe one drawback to the game is the storyline
its totally convoluted and makes no sense
things do not connect giving you a logical story arch with a satisfying resolution
the characters seemingly get involved in missions at random and i couldnt fathom why the main characters even continued on their quest
but aside from that confusion the actual gameplay was engagingthis game is a visual treat and its very fun to play
i played through by myself and now im playing with a friend
both ways are very enjoyable
there is a storyline and the npcs are done very well
the animations and spell effects look great on the play station   wait till you see the water effects in the game
the best thing is that they are making a sequel that will be twice as big as this one
if you enjoy a good hack and slash with some rpg elements then buy this fun gamei am a huge fan of the baldurs gateps tormentfallout games on the pc
i picked up this game thinking id have zaney npcs coming along with me on some huge adventure full of sidequests and crazy fun
when i first started i was impressed with the graphics and sound and it seemed rather promising with the characters too
as the game progressed i quickly found out that it was essentially a diablo clone ie a massive dungeon crawl
you hack and slash through level upon beautifullyrenderedlevel all the while taking trips back to the local store with your recall potions to drop off your loot and upgrade your equipment
the sidequests usually involve you talking to someone near the local store finding the item they are looking for and returning it to them
over all the character interaction is a bare minimum and the story is rather stretched
before you know it the game is over and you import your character into a harder mode and do it all  over replay value is better with friends around
pick this up if you want a fun way to kill a couple of hours with some friends or by yourself
just dont hope for the traditional bg gaming style and youll be okbaldurs gate dark alliance is an excellent game its as simple as that
the action is intense and satisfying the graphics are some of the best available for the ps and the production values are just top notch
the storyline is a bit underdeveloped though and the rpg stuff has been dumbed down in the assumption that console gamers dont like depth as much as pc gamers  but these points lose their luster if you have a friend to play with
dark alliance is easily one of the best twoplayer games available as it allows you and an ally to hack your way through the campaign together
more games should offer cooperative multiplay if its this much fun
if only there were a few more characters to pick from you only get three assuming you dont count the unlockable drizzt dourden  awesome
and a little more depth to the roleplaying this game would be the best available for the ps
as it stands its still a classicfinal score bi bought this game without seeing it or even reading a review about it
that is something i rarely do but it wasnt that bad of a price and i was ordering some other stuff and i love dd games
well i wasnt disappointed
i didnt expect much of anything from this game and so i was more impressed than someone looking for a classic baldurs gate game
i have the computer version but havent played it yet and i knew this would be nothing like it
the first time i popped it in i didnt stop playing for like  hours
it was just fun
the battles are crazy and the graphics are very good especially when walking through water
a few knocks on it are the camera which is kinda far away and can be awkward at times especially in massive battles you tend to fight like  or more enemies at once in a big swarm and it is hard to see who you are hitting
i havent tried a magic user yet only the dwarf and it is just pure enjoyment
if you are looking for classic rpg deep story or nonlinear gameplay stay away cause this game has a simple story and pretty much forces you in one direction
it reminds me a lot like vampire redemption for the pc
the controls are easy and the level up system is nice and just like vampire since you can control how your character levels up instead of just predetermined stat boosting
only problem  with this system is if you plan wrong your character will suffer later
one thing i didnt get was what the developers were thinking when they put thos stupid mega man like floating boulders over pits that sunk when you landed on them
aside from looking stupid those parts were just terribly frustrating but passable
its sad to say but for the type of game this is i would have given it  stars if it werent for those ridiculous things
but all in all if you like a good action game like maximo or jak and daxter but with a darker dd twist then go for this game and even those hardcore rpg fans may like this game as a vacation from complex plot lines and massive hours required to complete a game
give it a try it is fun and worth itfor the past four years black isle has been synonmous with quality
my top three all time favorite pc games baldurs gate  fallout  and torment are all black isle games
black isle games have a level of depth and quality that other studios have yet to match in my opinion
with that in mind this game was the deciding factor when i bought my ps
granted it was still in the developemental stage and i knew it would never have the depth of the pc versions but the black isle name and the baldurs gate franchise was enough to interest mei got the xbox when it first came out and i honestly thoguht id never play another ps game that could compete
let me tell you dark alliance holds its own with any of the xbox games i own
not only that but it is the best ps game ive ever seen
the graphics are superb the gameplay is addictive and for a console rpg its surprisingly deep
after playing all those pc games i didnt think id ever find a console rpg that could hold my interestdont buy this game expecting a sequel to the bg series
this game is different in several ways not all of which are bad
the graphics are far superior and the stability of the ps means no bugs or crashes something fallout  and torment as good as they were are notorious for
on the down side you can only choose from three different characters and only get one character per player without the benefits of rolling your own stats
on the upside you can play with a friend and it takes the game to a whole new levelits really unfair to compare this game to the original bg games both of which were over  cds long and took hundreds of hours to complete
this game never tries to achieve the same things the pc versions do but instead it is a leap in a new direction
it has all the highpaced action of gauntlet but set in the colorful forgotten realms
if this sounds good to you you wont be disappointed
even fans of the old bg games should keep an open mind and give this a try
once you get over the differences its a blast to playi thought dungeons  dragons was long dead resting comfortably in a grave with a colourful wreath of the success in endured in the s
i had never heard of the baldurs gate numerous times for the pc and the last game i played of dungeons  dragons was all the way back with slayer on the panasonic do
simple game st person navigating through basements and castles while fighting off hordes of ugly looking enemies like ogres and the infamous gelatinous cubes
and now at least  years later comes baldurs gate for the playstation  the same idea as slayer but a whole new world of actionrpg gamingbaldurs gate has enjoyed a successful run on the pc for the past few years and just now has been transferred to the console masses and ps  is lucky enough to be first to receive it
however instead of direct ports from already existing titles dark alliance creates and entirely new gaming system for the ps version about time
weve seen this type of game before no doubt most recently drakan and dynasty warriors  and even back as far as the original gauntlet for that matter
baldurs gate is nothing more than a hack  slash at heart but manages to become so much more than its blood vein genre has ever offered
being this is the first ps title taken from a pc game that actually utilizes the full power of your playstation systemthree playable characters are offered for your journey the female elf who possesses great magic capabilities the male human who is a master with arrows and the physical powerhouse male dwarf
all characters can be armed to the teeth with dozens of weapons from axes swords hammers and armour from leather to steel
grab a friend to join you in the melee and i can guarantee youll be in your chairs in no time
and it is very nice to finally play a player game that doesnt use a splitscreen method but rather and overhead so both characters are displayed on screen at once which is a welcome for those with small tv screens
the player mode is a fantastic breather from the typical deathmatch thats carelessly thrown into every game for a quick buck on replay value halflifes ps is my prime example
which could have been added into this no doubt but thank god it wasntthe story is drawn straight from the classic blood vein of old school medieval adventures
your arrival in baldurs gate is greeted by being beaten and robbed by a band of thieves who are currently at war with another guild of thieves in baldurs gate
and as you seek your revenge the ploy of the war of thieves is a mere tip of the iceberg of events to come as an ancient evil threatens to burn baldurs gate to the ground
and your journey takes you to distant lands in mountains swamps and your final destination a sinister tower that seemingly rises from the earth itselfwhether you draw big on story driven games or not baldurs gate has to be commended for its astonishing voice actors and probably the best lipsync ever created in gaming history
the battle system is simple button mashing but increases its lifespan by intertwining dozens of hand weapons bows and magic spells to lay waste to enemies not to mention many special items that can be claimed for the wide assortment of sidequest and for those who prefer to search every inch of the levels will find that their efforts will be rewarded
armour also plays a huge part in baldurs gate not only actually improving characters defence unlike drakan but literally giving players a mindboggling assortment of customization for their appearances
elements such as fire and ice are attributed to swords and axes for instance swords with ice have a great chance of freezing enemies then allowing them to be smashed to pieces with the following attack
i was amazed to see a hack  slash game be so incredibly addictive and enjoyable
its even more fun if you play with a friend and the experience system will keep you playing for hours to master new techniques and gather the ultimate weapon arsenal
its one of the few games that grows beyond its genre and creates a pedestal for all others to follow
dark alliance is a fantastic game and one i sincerely hope to see continue a must havebaldurs gate dark alliance is port from a popular pc game
if you like rpgs but dont like having to go though menu after menu in order to fight just one enemy then this is your gamethe first thing that hits about this game is its amazing graphics
the characters look act and move in a realistic manner
even the objects in the game react in a real way
i had fun with the environment
just look at how the water ripples as you move though it
this detail also has a purpose as some objects are breakable and contain helpful items
how does rippling water help
play the game and youll find outwith three different playable characters an elf dwarf and archer and one hidden character replay can be moderate or high
however since you can have a second player you might want to call you favorite character before buddy does
the game is realistic enough that if use magic against your friend it can cause some damage ie
using a fireball to kill an enemy thats fighting your friendthe fighting system is simple enough that anyone can just star the game and play
if you cant understand the controls or how to use them there is a tutorial for you
it shows you everything you need to know including how to use the ingame menusi do have some problems with the game
one thing is that its a little short
that is if you were to be partial to playing long games like final fantasy vii viii etc
there are only a few sidequests and i think the game could have added a few more
otherwise for beginners its perfectthis is a great game but you dont have to take my word on it
buy it and see for your selfthis is a perfect chip off the baldurs gate series that has done so well on the pc
as with all of them it is a third person rpg composed primarily hack slash and bespell
add a dash of sneak and run and you have the entire spectrum of strategies available
if anything there is even less story content on the ps than there is on the pcs
i didnt count them but there are about thirtyfive levels maybe the same number of monster typesbasically the plot consists of arriving in baldurs gate getting mugged and going after the malefactors
on thing leads to another and soon you are haring all over the countryside killing everything in your sight until you come facetoface with an old enemy of the town  on titanic battle later you are looking at the creditsin retrospect it is hard to believe that someone who spent list price for this game would be very happy about the game play
even at the on sale close out price i was a bit stunned to get through the game in less than  hours on the first shot
and im not a particularly fast player
the game is beautiful to look at motion is fluid and you have good control of the camera angle
but all that artwork takes up most of the space on the dvd and the game really screams for more of just about everythingof course you could always just keep playing the game over until you felt you had gotten your moneys worth
since game play is a bit monotonous this is a viable option
but no matter what you do you will always wind up in the same places with the same experience points and some slight variation in spells not much if you want to win
there just isnt time to do any real character building
oh well it was almost fun while it lastedi picked up baldurs gate dark alliance bgda for playstation  after finishing dungeons  dragons heroes on the xbox
im familiar with bioware who consistently makes games i really enjoy including neverwinter nights and star wars knights of the old republic
additionally baldurs gate came first before dd heroes so i knew there would be some improvements
still maleficent and i enjoy blowing stuff up together so we needed a new fix and baldurs gate fit the billunlike dd heroes bgda pretends it has roleplaying elements and in doing so just highlights how nonroleplaying the game is
similar to star wars knights of the old republic and neverwinter nights there are conversation trees
when you speak to a character you select a series of responses from a menu
there are maybe five characters you can talk to in total and your conversation doesnt really matter  we quickly discovered that clicking the top choice always meant wed get to hear the whole story
but you can just skip the whole story too and get right to the matter at hand which means the roleplaying elements are just trappings to make it seem more like dd
forget character customization too at least at character creation
there are three character types including an elven sorceress dwarven cleric
i didnt play him so not sure and human arcane archer
some warning flags should go off for folks who play the third edition of dd  one cannot start out as an arcane archer thats a prestige class
but that doesnt matter  the human named vahn is whom you get to play
while he can hack things up in melee vahns clearly optimized for ranged combat
the game gives subtle hints like dropping great heaps of arrows as the only equipment you find in treasure hoardsbgda is obviously geared towards a particular breed of player  the young  male kind
the first character you interact with is a blonde elf that is quite buxom and has a habit of leaning forward gesturing towards her chest or thrusting her hips
similarly the elven sorceress is only elflike in that she has pointed ears  the rest of her is quite human
the artwork especially for a ps game is fantastic
the backgrounds and sound effects are impressively crafted and filled with a loving attention to detail
the characters themselves move smoothly and act like real people in their hand gestures and emotions  even the lizard man acts slightly inhuman in how he speaks and moves
the voice acting is well done but thats something ive come to expect from biowarethere are some lazy shortcuts that were very irritating in their exclusion
one lizard man sends the heroes through an elemental plane of water spends five minutes explaining how dangerous the journey will be and then we see a cut scene focusing on some random tower
poof
that whole waterdrowning thing
we never see it  we dont even see animation explaining the journey
we have to trust on faith that it was a tough swim through the elemental plane of water
when everything else is narrated and explained in such painstaking detail i expect to see animation explaining itthere is of course all the good stuff that some people think equates with a roleplaying game you can buy equipment switch out arms and armor and train particular feats and spells as you advance
little of these powers resemble third edition dd  fire shield is considerably weaker than its tabletop counterpart
strangely my character was unharmed by maleficents burning hands even when she was blasting right through him but her fireballs hurt him
go figuresome of the monsters are radically different from their tabletop equivalents in weird ways
in neverwinter nights umber hulks are wusses with an irritating confusion gaze
in bgda they are terrifying juggernauts sans gaze
drow are still as sneaky as ever its clear bioware has a soft spot for the darkskinned elves dragons are still a pain in the ass and giants are suitably fearsome
bulette burrow and are extremely difficult to kill which is appropriate although they waddle like fast moving turtlesnot how i envisioned them or how they move in dd heroesperhaps the most unforgivable flaw in the game is that it crashed
thats right folks just like a pc the screen went white and the game crashed hard
considreing we were at a critical point in the game and a lot of objects were on the screen at the same time magic missiles multiple enemies arrows etc
i imagine it overtaxed the ps
but what the heck  if i wanted a game that would crash i would have played it on a pcas a game developer myself for retromud i was surprised to see that every corpse and item stays where it is
that means theres no object cleanup
this means that the system has to determine the location of every item corpse and monster at all times
corpses stay right where they are which is alternately cool and disturbing especially in rooms of mass slaughter
this problem was resolved in dd heroes the corpses disintegrate but its a big mistake for a game of this size and probably led to the aforementioned crashi also got stuck once in an area due to clipping errors
these are amateurish mistakes that i havent since seen repeated certainly not in dd heroes so im willing to forgive the developers
but its their first foray onto console games and it shows
its a good game but there are better games now with less boring clicksotheyshutup roleplaying elementsi have never sat down and played a dungeons and dragons game my boyfriend is in to it so i get the jist of things
this game touches mildly on dungeons and dragons and is more of a diablo style game
you go through a story battle various types of creatures and enter odd landsit was good to see different types of creatures to fight and not the same thing over and over in each land you went through
i felt as though customizing your character to wear what she or he wanted was fantasticthe only down side to this game it was a little short and i felt as though the graphics and camera angles could have been better
i felt as though being able to head to a store when ever you wanted to should have been in play through the whole game
it was rather a disappointment entering the tower only to find you could not teleport back to a store to sell or make new purchases
the armor in this game should have been a bit broader in many aspects thus making me feel as though my character couldnt keep getting betterall in all if you liked diablo youll love this game it is very similar to it
aside from my small complaints i give this game major props
i am looking forward to playing the second one and i hope that all the small issues i disliked about the game are better in the second onei played baldurs gate three times
once is usually enough for me
the option to choose among three characters with different abilities and weapons adds variety
automatic healthmeter refills with the push of a button and choice between weapons or spells once set were a big speed advantagethere are a few things that would improve this game however
i was uncomfortable with the birdseye view
looking down on the heros location seemed unatural
i wished the upgrade meter would fill up faster so i could take advantage of all the neat spells i didnt have the opportunity to explore and the game should be twice as longthis game is great to play with a close friend
ive been playing with my roommate and we take turns being the sorceress and the dwarf
this is a good combination since the sorceress can alternate between spells and a bow while the dwarf rushes into the fray with a big axe and lots of armor
the action is great
the graphics are really stunning esp
water effects
the one annoying thing is that you have to go sell and buy things a lot which is inherently boring in a video game and since the characters have different quotcharismasquot which determines prices theres a certain logic to having the most charismatic character in our case the sorceress sell and buy everything
given that she cant carry much this means a lot of dropping and picking things up which gets really repetitive
if you didnt mind the commerce in diablo this is pretty similar so youll be okcouple of tipsif you play with the dwarf save up points to get whirlwind attack as soon as possible
this is a way to attack multiple enemies that really makes the game much more fun since the dwarf is kind of limited to hacking and slashing
also always raise your strength when possible
this helps you both carry more and hurt your enemies morewith the sorceress skip the following spells to save pts for the better ones  acid arrow snowblind and fireball
these spells are both ineffective and boring to use
trust me the other spells are worth the waitim the first to admit that there are now lots of wickedly addictive rpg games that make this feel like it is what it is something out of the last generation of games
whats also worth mentioning though is that this is still a great game best when shared with a friend or family member
i would wager that this will still be the case  years from now
theres just something almost timeless about this game
and there are plenty of reasons to buy a copy of your own
so go ahead and buy with confidencedevoid of wisdom regarding the world of dungeons amp dragons or the pages of the forgotten realms i can however discern a worthy rpg when i play one
lavished with the traits of an honorable dungeoncrawler baldurs gate dark alliance produces a flatout aura of fantasy carnage
riotous battlelust practically oozes from the controller
the screen dumbfounds even the dullest of the dull with its fanciful schemas
there is a topnotch cast of voiceovers from the brilliant folks of soul revaer   an uncomplicated control scheme runs like childs play
vivendi universals achievement may not cede groundbreaking innovation but chucks in the best of the hackandslash breed
dont get too excited yet though
dark alliance is not to be mistaken for being wholly unblemished
underneath its armor are a few perceptible dents
an obstructing isometric camera view can really fuel some frustration when two players thwart in accord
avid readers of the forgotten realms may even grit their teeth because dark alliances plot is nowhere linked to that of the books but is an entirely new narrativean account of strife and escalating war extricates in the progression of bloodspattering cinematics
if you spend your leisure on fantasy novels then dark alliance is highly urged with its grand craftsmanship of storytelling
squaresoft can take a seat and learn from final fantasy xs somewhat forced and yappy dialogue
nothing is more pleasing then seeing characters from books come alive and dark alliance has several characters from baldurs gate play some quick or trivial roles
if you eye a dampd zealot grinning about youll understand why
the quest itself initiates once the player selects which boots he shall tread thick and thin through
will it be adrianna the eleven sorceress vahn the human ranger or kromlech the dwarven fighter
whichever the player sinks duty into well preparations is key with an assortment of magical weapons to slay the hundreds of beasts swarming about
dark alliance is mainly focused on slashing through caverns and other regions awaiting to challenge the forces of good
when gaining a level the player selects a handful of points onto different attributes of his character like increasing strength intelligence etc
the plot  proceeds as the players progresses from town to town and collects information
dark alliance in one word is mayhem limbs are cut off and sprays of blood flutter everywhere
story advancement takes place in  acts
 players can fight in unison ripping holes through the lines of monster hordes
but if youre the solitary type the game done alone is an even better undergo since the field map on p mode gets squashed in and identifying your character becomes tedious
as a glut of graphically overbearing spells hobgoblins and heroes blast onto the screen the p mode slows down dramatically
but whats so great about the fluid combat is that the controller works like a true architecture
every button is used and used often
with realtime action and with each blade spewing blood and  throaty screams dark alliance is as actionpacked as a summer blockbusterrepresented in realtime polygons dark alliances animation plays with robust attitude
vivendi universal  conveys their brute of prowess fabricating an immense world of unending brilliance
relying profoundly on flesh clammy monsters and relentless battlegrounds the sheer scope outstrips that of diablo ii on the pc
environments are juiced up bursting with activity and containing some of the best environmental effects
streaming helpings of aesthetics will not have any gamer yawn with gripe
the unyielding action is smooth and breathes red hot goreat its brim moments the hour quest was a very pleasing experience
not once did i found myself falling into the mess of grogginess only jamming buttons while shouting slurs at the merciless multitude of enemies
even if dark alliance lacked mindbending puzzles which would have been a big plus the rpg will still entertain those infatuated with of the hackandslash genre
hour upon hour  helpings of flying flesh planted a firm smirk on my face
if your soul is full of bloodlust and desired butchery by all means get this and satiate that hunger
note  this reviewer is very violent and loves gorei thought this game was a lot of fun
i see a lot of graphics  improvement over the earlier pc versions as well as the diablo series
i havent had a chance to play it as a two player game yet but i am looking forward to thatsome of the limitations of the game that i have run into are bad but not so much that its unusable
one thing is that there is a level with jumping puzzles
baldurs gate is not a platform game so it shouldnt have a super mario brothers type thing where you jump on a block and it falls down underneath you to lava
another thing is the uselessness of gems
im used to other games such as diablo  that allow me to use gems for enhancing weapons
it confused me to discover that there is no way to do that
also i may be spoiled from games like chrono cross but i want to be able to run away from bosses
im on act iii in the game but so far ive really needed to go pawn off some of the extra armor and weapons that i picked up after unknowingly walking into a boss
you cant use the recall potions or anything there which is stupidall in all its a fun game
im sure many people who play the pc versions of baldurs gate scoff at the ps version because theres no network play
however if you can live without that this version of baldurs gate is great funbaldurs gate dark alliance turned out to be a better game than i expected it to be
i got it on discount and didnt think it would be that entertaining but it looked different and i was in the mood for something more actionroleplaying oriented so i picked it upi got involved right after i started and played on and off for three days until i beat the game
the game is basically an actionadventure game with some extras that make it feel like a role playing game though as many diehard dd people point out its not a true roleplaying game
the plot of the story goes something like this youre a stranger to the city of baldurs gate
not long after arriving you are robbed and beaten by a gang of thieves
however before they can kill you the city guard shows up and the gang runs away
you enter the elfsong inn and talked to the woman who runs the place
she tells you she will pay you some money if you will kill all the rats in the basement
you agree and she gives you a rusty knife
thats where the adventure begins
there are three main sections to the story involving somewhere around  different levels
along the way you fight rats ogres giants a beholder lots of evil men a dragon and all sorts of other creaturesat the beginning of the game you are allowed to choose between one of three characters an elf maiden a archer man and a dwarf warrior
of the three the dwarf is my favorite because hes able to carry more booty than anyone else
the elf maiden is probably the most difficult character because shes mainly a magician and even when you reach the end of the game her spells arent that powerful
the more creatures you kill the more experience points you get and the more levels you move up
the higher your experience the more abilities you are capable of doingthe graphics dark alliance were pretty cool and i really liked how you could rotate the screen around to look around objects
however there are certain areas where this feature is not available
dialogue between characters is mainly done through an option of selecting some prechosen lines
usually if you choose the first option youll hear everything the characters will tell youoverall i found dark alliance to be enjoyable
it engulfed me for almost three days and i dont regret the time i spent playing it
serious role players and serious gamers might not get as much out of it but for the average joe its a good gamechart a course between the mindless action of gauntlet and the rpg elements of diablo and youll find yourself in baldurs gate dark alliance
bearing no resemblance to the series on the pc except for the name locales and most of the third edition rules of dungeons and dragons dark alliance may upset longtime fans at first
the story unfolds as the town of baldurs gate is besieged with a troublesome new thieves guild
your character seeks to track them down to reclaim stolen gold but soon realize there is a much bigger problem at hand
a fell shadow is falling over the land and baldurs gate is merely one point in a great upcoming conflict that you are now drawn into
the visuals are flat out gorgeous with environments that are both intricately detailed and quite enormous
the action is viewed from a top down perspective so you can see the entire hordes of orcs and frost giants hot on your trail as well as the witnessing the full extent of the carnage your full scale magic attacks cause
you can get a close up view of your character and other residents through story and menu screens which make you sorely wish for a way to get such a detailed view during battlecombat is achieved through straightforward action with most all commands accessable without opening the menu screen
the action is fast and furious although youll need to employ lots of hit and run tactics until you can find or buy better weapons and armor
leveling up your characters is easier than tradditonal dampd style games but your limited to how much you can get built up since enemies dont regenerate and there arent many optional sidequests
another gripe is that its short for an rpg about  hours even if its main focus is action
the audio holds its own against the graphics with rich orchestral background music and sharp sound effects
the voice overs are extremely well done and help sell the dramatic story
if you simply are not a fan of action rpgs then none of this is likely to win you over and baldurs gate purists will have to have an open mind
for the other  of playstation  owners baldurs gate dark alliance is absolutely worth checking out and a highly recommended purchase for action rpg fansthis game has extremely great graphics and lots of very well done voice acting but the gameplay itself has a certain lack of varietygraphics these graphics are better than anything ive ever seen in ps game
facial expressions down to every wrinkle extremely smooth textures and everything else imaginablesound very good voice acting probaly the best i have heard
it adds to the mysteriouness of the gamecontrol
simplistic great controls
i especially like how they did the potionscinemas nothing special just some here and there to explain stuffreplay well i suppose you could play it againstory
it makes you want to finish the gameoverall fun  this is a good game but it doesnt really have any combos or anything
the leveling up system is a lot simplier than the other baldurs gate games
its better but the game is short
definitely rent this game its up to you if you want to buy itgood newsinteresting gameplaymore charactersbad newsstill doesnt make as much sense as marvel vs capcom  or theythe characters also dont fight as fast nor as powerful as the ones on marvel vs capcom  or maybe someweird newswill they actually bring the entire capcom and snk families to the showcan they make the moves more interesting and organized just like in marvel vs capcom
for example ryus shinku hadouken and kens shinryuken are a whole lot better in marvel vs capcom  and  than they are herefinal newsi think that this is a really cool game as a whole
but they could make some sense out of it
if they added strider hayato hanzo andy or anyone else but no more street fighters and king of fighters and the switching assisting team up attacks and the really insane super moves this would be a perfect gamethis is my first fighting game i have ever gotten
i tried one on the arcade and i thought id absolutly love any kind of fighting game i picked
this got really good reviews so i picked it
when i did get it to tell you truth i didnt understand it a bit
i didnt know what the grooves were or the ratios
i still am a little baffled but i will figure it out sooner or later
besides that i think the game is ok it has several modes that will make this game a decent one for anyones library
i think i made a pretty good choice of my first fighting game because i am really not that dissapointedif you liked the first one youll defenitley like the second
there are many characters to choose from
there also two secret characters too
the intense fighting makes the game great for lovers of capcom and snk
the graphics arent all that great but its replaced by great gameplay and animation
so this game i reccomend for the fighting genreoriginally entitled capcom vs snk  millionaire fighting  in japan
capcom vs snk for the dreamcast was no doubt the best among the vs series and gamers agree that this was the best d fighting game that should not be passed up
it has pleased both capcom fans and snk fans altogther but some snk fans complained about how they changed the characters but most snk fans really liked how capcom enhanced their favorite snk heroes with beatifully rendered anime style animation
now two years have passed and the freshly made sequel capcom vs snk  mark of the millenium was announced and it was said to be better than the prequel of the gameonly this time it was going to release for the playstation  as one of the first d fighters for the console along with sammy entertainments guilty gear x in the us since the dreamcast is going out of business
but i didnt complain since there was still some hope for me
i found that the dc version was available in japan and i ordered it off of a store where they sell japanese import games for all kinds of platforms
currently i own the game as a japanese import for the dreamcast and it played very well
i also played the ps version as well at a nearby videogame store
ive expected the ps to surpass the d animation of the dreamcasts superior d fighters but unfortunately it didnt
like marvel vs capcom  for the dc the graphics are amazing and the backgrounds are fully detailed in gorgeous d technology
but nothing compared to marvel vs capcom  or the imported dc version of capcom vs snk  the d animation was way too pixelated
if youre not familiar with what im saying let me sum it up for you
the characters look kinda bumpy
i have known the ps for its gracefully enhanced technology in gaming but thisi was very disappointed with what i saw
it seems like the ps is not good at making good looking d fighters
thats why ive taken one star down
it wouldve made  stars if it hadnt been for the horrible d animated characters
the gameplay still remained solid and it plays the same as its prequel which is a good thing
the contols remain simple and sometimes hard to master
once again the gameplay still combines the best of capcom and snks spectacular playability
some d haters may call it another joke but this is still one the best ideas in capcom d fighting in years
the sound is fantastic and it sounds way better than the first
unlike marvel vs capcom  which suffered from horrible unfit jazz music the tracks are very cool to listen to all day
the genres include hip hop guitar and orchestral music the rap theme on the new york stage sounds cool and the appearance of akuma and rugal sounds like youre watching a movie
and the voice acting is great
although there are some changes there are no problems whatsoever
the cast of characters are an amazing surprise to the fans of snk and capcom
your tears will shed as you see new warriors step into the ring like rock howard the son of geese howard you will see him in fatal fury mark of the wolves on dreamcast hyo imawanos younger brother kyosuke kagami from rival schools and project justice kasumis father mr todo from art of fighting fame the joke street fighter dan hibiki the strongest kickboxer from thailand joe higashi from the fatal fury series athena asamiya from the kof series yun and yang from street fighter iii yang is a secret character hibiki takane from last blade  and more 
you will be thoroghly amazed when you see the new bosses of the game like shin akuma and god rugal
plus some unique features to unlock
rather than just buying characters colors stages and features by using a short amount of vs points you can just earn them by simply playng through the game
and plus its much more easier to earn groove points during battle depending on which character your using
all in all capcom vs snk  for the ps is a great d fighter but it couldve been more exciting if the d animation werent so bumpy and pixelated
still this is even better than the original and belive me
once you own this game youll feel very proud of owning it 
still if you want to experience the perfect capcom vs snk  do what i do and order the japanese version for the dreamcast
this version is the same as the ps version only with better character animation
but still both versions are very impressive
if you loved capcom vs snk for the dreamcast there is no reason why you should ignore capcom vs snk  mark of the millenium  for the ps
respect it by buying it this game is a one of the best street fighter type games ive played
the character sprites and controls are great
the audio and graphics are excellent for the time it came out
the game is very bright and the anouncer is funny
i was still able to play chunli and get a few good rounds in
there are many modes to try out
these types of games have a learning curve and its ground that has been tread before so its not quite new
the variety of characters and animations make up for it
the backgrounds are quite funny too
if you see this game anywhere used its worth the money
its an entertaining fighting game that is still good
i own the ps versioni have the gamecube version so there might be differences between my description and the ps or xbox game
the reason i say what i do in the headline is because this game takes the best of the two companies libraries polishes them till theyre flawless and lets you run with it
most notably it has more sf alpha and rival schools characters than any other crossover fighting game
only a few flagship characters are missing such as sfs alex darkstalkers felicia kofs andy shodowns charlotte
they let you give any of the  grooves to any character so you can have zangief using shodowns rage system and terry busting out custom combos a la sf alpha and this does significantly change how you play each character
some characters are tweaked for balance ken has a couple moves he never had in any sf game but if you ask me he doesnt need them but not majorlythe fighting isnt as fast as marvel v capcom  nor the capcom roster so replete but its not supposed to be
mvc is a different kind of fighter this is technical and excellently so
theres no glitchy mechanics that gyp you out of a wellexecuted combo or glaring character imbalances even dan hibiki is competentcontrary to another reviewers claim there are a few unlockables more powerful versions of ryu akuma iori and rugal a toolkit that lets you create your own custom groove and a bossfight play modethe xbox version of this game has online play but reviewers call it an online jankfest meaning its too laggy to be much fun
other than that there shouldnt be any major difference between each console version
get the one youre most comfortable with the controller forwho would win in a fight bewtwwenn street fighter and the king of fighters
now find out in the awesome and sweeeeet capcom vs snk  this version even if its older is better than the recently released gamecube and xbox versions
big deal the xbox version has online play it was the last system to get the game
personally if you try to take me on in this game you will get killed by my team vega riot blood iori and rugal
so just bring iti cannot believe all the negative reviews this game has received
first of all if you are a fan of the capcom fighting games and if you are also a fan of the snk fightersboth worlds collide and you get the best of them
this game is a major upgrade from its predecessor which was also a great game
give credit where credit is due if you like fighting games let alone capcom or snk fighters you are in fighting game wonderland with this title
you get a wide variety of fighters from the capcom and snk universeyou can choose from up to six grooves and  customizable grooves after you beat the game under certain criteria
great sound great gameplay great game
it is especially fun when played against your friendsthis is the title i play the most against other players
even if you are not a fighting game fan this game will turn you aroundthe graphics are cool seeing the back ground with a cripy tash of animation
i wish the fighter could move as fast like the other fight game marvel vs campcom
the action is a bit slow for methis is a game for people who like to incorporate strategy into their fights
if you have xbox live do not buy this on ps get it on xbox so you can play it online
i personaly prefer guilty gear x over this anydaycapcom vs snk  is one of my most played games because i always enjoy capcom vs games and having classic capcom characters fight some of the classic snk characters of course will be an enjoyable experience if your a fan for either series and in capcom vs snk  there is even more characters which is great
now the problems with this game
there is not much variety in the selection of characters chosen for this game because to me it should of been named street fighter vs snk the reason why is because the only characters that were not from the street fighter series is morrigan from darkstalkers kyosuke from rival schools and maki from final fight
i thought capcom could at least put some more darkstalker characters in the game like pyron tailban or demitri they couldve also put some red earth characters and some third strike characters in but that would probably make them spend more because they would have to redraw the characters which means new pixels which brings me to the other problem with the game
the reusing of pixels come on capcom could of at least spent a little more money on this game by totally redrawing every character for this whole game with hires pixels like guilty gear it would be really cool
another problem with this game is the constant upgrades and downgrades of some characters moves just to make it balanced a little bit more i hate that
i want the way the characters are in there original games no matter how overpowering there moves may seem or how weak a character may seem thats the fun of fighting games perfecting the usage of a character no matter how hard they are to play with
also one other thing i didnt like about capcom vs snk  and also the first capcom vs snk is the backgrounds i always find it unusual when ther is d backgrounds in a d fighting game i would of preffered it if they totally made up some new backgrounds or bring back some of the old stages from the capcom and snk games but newly drawn
the last thing i didnt like about this game is that there is no specific ending for each character that would of been really awesome
but other then those reasons overall the game is still fun
i could play it for many hours before i pass out from exhaustion or dehydration and the survival mode is really hard to which is great
you can alos increase the game speed and use the many grooves in the game which is a specific power guage with specific attributes my suggestion is to master a groove and i mean it there is no point for the other grooves
there is also specific modes where you dont have to use the ratio rule which is good
but anyways this is a fun gamethis game turned out to be a good game
the way the boat moves and gameplay is the greatest
the storyline gets a bit confusing with the wierd names they use for the characters
you have to beat certain levels on certain difficulties to get nice new boats and arenas to use in multiplayersome of the levels seem impossible though
there are no checkpoints to save your progress in the middle of a level
if you like and never get sick of blowing up other boats with many weapons this is the best game for yougreat graphics but a bit monotonous on the gameplay
basically you drive an armed boat and blow things up to a story line
it is fun though and i have a good time playing it
i am yet to do at it in multiplayer so i cannot comment on that aspect of the gamegetting through it is very easy on easy level and does go up from there
easy though is very easy
ensign level this is more like cabin boy levelthis was a very good guide
it is well illustrated with great maps and character moves to help you complete your gamethis game is very fun
there is only one problem
there is only maximum of  different weapons for each boat which stinks
in all though this game is very funthis game is not the best xbox game out there coughhalocough
however this game is fairly entertaining in its own respect
i wont go into the details about the graphics boats and water are fantastic other graphics less impressive
the storyline is average with the cheesy voiceovers that you find in just about every game these days
the one player missions are challenging and you have to play them to unlock all the boats for multiplayer
the mutliplayer features various modes all of which are pretty good
theres nothing like blowing up my roomates ship w a torpedo
the key to remember w blood wake is its a vehicular combat game on water nothing more nothing less
this game isnt groundbreaking but it is fun
i would say that unless you know for sure you want this game to go out and rent it first to see how you like it
just remember that you wont have access to all the multiplayer boats until you unlock them in the one player missions
overall this is a good game that belongs in the upper tier of xbox titlesjust like the series its derived from the story mode of the game pretty much mirrors the sequences of opponents he faces
if youve watched the anime and already know the opponents its interesting to see them fight in the game and actually try your hand at beating them
mashiba has that nasty flicker jab and hayami has that annoying shotgun punchas one reviewer said set your left analog stick to expert control and use the l for sway
you can control ippo much much better that was
the default controller settings leave much to be desired
i think most people who complained about the controls never bothered trying to change the settings for them or even the camera angles to suit their fighting style better
after setting the left analog stick to expert and sway to l i fought alot better and covered more ground around the ring
fightingwise its a pretty well balanced game with the standard straights hooks and uppercuts plus some special moves per boxer
you will do alot of bobbing and weaving in this game as there is an absence of blocking which is too bad as that wouldve made this game better especially near the last opponents who become very very challenging
i really really like this game and recommend others to watch the series to appreciate the game a bit moredave mirra freestyle bmx  is not as good as it should be
the music is good
im a rock fan
but some cheap things are oh say the backflip to grind
no ones ever done it
there not insane stupid or crazy enough
also there are plants in this video game that when you run over them they crack like wood
bottom line stick to the thps seriesnfsu does capture the idea of building and racing cars but i think they could go a little further into the design of your socalled pimpmobile
the only interior you get to design is the trunk i think they could at least do the seats or the wheel
outside design is aok anything from sideskirts to multicolored vinyels you make your car fiercethe plotline in single player mode really dosent go that deep your just some guy who wants to get his title backin multiplayer you race your own cars in tracks you already won but the downside is the whole graphics in two player is horribleit is a game worth getting but you might sell it later onbut theres just no sense of speed in this game thats pretty much its only con so what am i complaining about this game is a really good street roaming game you search for a shop or a race
you can choose races like street x drag drift sprint normal and the underground racing leaguetricking out your car is the funnest your cars look so sweet and theres so many different ways to customize your ride
overall it doesnt have the best graphics but the music and sounds are great
a great racing gameits good but its not easy to get all the controls and succeedas one of the gamecubes launch titles a lot was expected of luigis mansion
are the graphics sparkling
is the gameplay interesting
do the controls work well
can nintendos most underappreciated character possibly grab part of the spotlight away from his brother
well the answers are yes yes yes and yesluigi wins a mansion one day from a contest that he didnt enter
yeah you read that right
mario went to check out the mansion to see if it was some kind of trap and still hasnt returned
luigi gets antsy and finally works up the courage to go into the mansion and search for his missing brotherwhen he gets into the mansion he discovers it is populated by hundreds of ghosts all of which are vulnerable to his scientist friend e gadds new vacuumcleanertype device called the poltergust
using this weapon and some slick thumb skills on the c stick luigi can capture the mansions spook population and get closer to finding his brotherthe graphics are nice certainly
the ghosts while not exactly frightening are very creatively done and they fit almost seamlessly into the environment
luigis constant shivering and toothchattering reminds you not to be scared anyway because hes doing plenty of that for youusing the poltergust you can unearth all kinds of secrets throughout the mansion but the real draw is the capturing of the apparitions ghostbustersstyle
the bigger bosstype ghosts all have something a little different about them a weakness that you must exhibit before being able to capture them and sometimes that can be half the fun
without question i think luigis mansion manages to live up to initial expectations delivering a familyfriendly experience a few spooky moments and even a classical mario reference in the form of the old theme song reproduced by a set of ghostly musical instruments
a game well worth its saltinventiveness   out of the game concept and design while not exactly resident evil is very well thoughtout and the unique flavor of the mario series manages to hang on to this ghosthunting adventuresound  just about all the sounds are good and the music is great but some of the ghosts noises get to be absolutely maddening after awhile
perhaps a few lessannoying sound effects next time nintendographics  a dark spooky mansion done in the lighthearted cartoony style of the mario series is a dark spooky mansion done right
again not a game to scare your pants off of you but rather to make you laugh at the fright of the protagonistcontrol  the arrangement of the controls while perfect for this game does seem a bit strange
the b button turns your flashlight on or off and the c stick controls the direction you turn the poltergust in to capture a ghost or other booty
while it may take some getting used to once you warm up to it itll make perfect sense i promiseoverall score  the bottom line a grated adventurous quest through a spooky mansion finally gets luigi the credit he deserves and it shows how much he really does love his brother despite the secondbanana role
good job nintendoyou may be fooled into thinking that luigi has been overshadowed by mario in every game hes ever been in but that is not the case
in  luigi got his first game all to himself and the premise actually involves him saving mario
the basic premise of luigis mansion is that the plumber in green wins a haunted mansion in which mario is trapped
a weird baby doctor character named professor e gadd gives him the tools he needs to rid the mansion of ghosts a flashlight and a vacuum cleaner
the gameplay works well overall and youll really feel like a ghostbuster has you master exposing ghosts hearts with your flashlight and sucking them up
the mansion is basically one huge multifloored dungeon so its a great thing that you have a functional map
the best parts of the game are the ghosts where you have to figure out how to expose their heart
allinall luigis mansion is quite a fun game and can now be enjoyed for quite a low pricethis is classic nintendo
easy to master yet still deep enough to be fun
unfortunately it is slightly repetitive and a little short
however the lighting effects and visuals are simply stunning
the hardest part in this game is getting the a and h levels
stunningly getting less than  is the hardest part in this game which admit it is kind of sadwell i must say a pretty good launch game from nintendo but certainly not their best
this game basicly lacks replay value and that hurts a game now a lot
so instead of adding more levels they basicly give you after you beat the game the same mansion just only with a few items in different spots
after playing the japanese version i wasnt disappointed at all as a matter of fact i was highly impressed
the puzzles are simple and not very complex that is until you inch your way to the end then it starts to pick up a bit but nothing to absoultly tease your brain over
for the average gamer  and up ill say  hours of gameplay if that so rent this one before a purchaseit would get  stars if it was  times longer
it would get  stars if it didnt have such great replay value
all in all its a great game so if you own everything in the world except this game or just want a fun game buy this game
its scary how great the graphics are and its highlighted when you see him turn a doorknob for the first timecool
the music is very hummable and the sound is hilarious especially if its from luigi
press a in the middle of nowhere and he says quotmarioquot in several different tonesone look at this game and youll see they didnt slack off
this game has some of the most breathtaking graphics the nintendo gamecube has to offer with smoothcontrol and easytounderstand gameplayhowever the game slacks off a little on gameplay time by that i mean how long it takes to beat the game and it honestly took me a day to complete less than  hours
its a bit shorter than most other gamecube titleson the good side though the game is easy to learn and a load of fun to play
this is the type of game that you would want to rent becuase you could probably finish it in a few daysa little bit about the gameput into a contest luigi never entered he wins a haunted house
when luigi attempts to visit it he discovers that mario is missing
playing as luigi and solving puzzles capturing ghosts ou must rescue mario wherever he is and rid the house of all the ghosts that roam itdid luidi do something wrong like get bad grades or something and drop out of school and ended up being a plummer
well yea i guess hes been grounded for like a billion years from being a star of any game and if he is a star in one the word mario is in the title and this game luigis mansion oh yeaaaa he has a mansion and since hes grounded from bad grades people he has to clean the whole house with a vacumone of the reasons i purchased this game is because it stars luigi
it is his first game where he stars alone but not completely as the plot has a lot to do with mario to save himas you would have guessed this game is about luigis mansion which he won in a competition he didnt even enter he invited his brother mario to visit it with him
but when luigi got there mario was gone and the mansion was overrun with ghosts
when luigi meets prof e gadd his goal becomes clear get rid of the ghosts find out the source of why this is happening and save his brother mario  and it may all have something to do with the boos and bowser
and whats worse is that luigi accidentally let the boos run riot around the mansion again all  of themthe gameplay plays like a platformer with d environments along with nintendo addition of a few mario traits like in the music room playing the mario bros themeluigi is in full control of a vacuum cleaner that sucks up ghosts and multiple other things in the environment to search for keys for the next door
sadly thats where the difficulty sets in and reputation lies
you must find so many keys fight a boss and then its onto the next level to do the same thing
along with annoying startledjumps from luigi when ghosts appearcatching ghosts other then portrait ghosts seems pointless except in some rooms where you will earn a key for defeating them
you dont get coins or points from normal ghosts only on rare occasions of hearts to replenish healthone thing that got to me was luigi cant actually jump punch or pound like mario is known for instead is one and only weapon is the vacuum cleaner
along with this gameboy horror to search thingsalso the camera angles in boss battles are annoyinga cute addition is the mushroom that causes luigi to get small and the pressing of the nintendo a button which has his call out mario
but beware collecting coins is one of your main goals and you will lose them when you get hit by ghosts
the main purpose of the coins is not to buy items or weapons instead it is more of your score at the end of the game to purchase your own mansion which you cannot enter and instead is a picture in the gallery of prof e gaddthe replay value is minimal as in the only new thing you unlock is the secret mansion which is the original mansion mirroredi know this review may seem a little negative but it was a really fun game
but short and not a lot of things to do but walk around many scenes arent skippable so it makes pressing the a button routinei probably wouldnt have bought this game when it first came out but now that its a players choice game with a cheaper price tagits worth it
like everyone else said this game doesnt really last too long although i thought that it was really fun
you suck ghosts up with a vaccum device and try to find mario
it doesnt have much replay value unfortunately
it was one i bought used and traded in for a new game when i was through
id probably recommend doing just that buying it used or renting it
but definitely play it
its a refreshing change from normal ol mario gamesluigis mansion was released at the launch of the nintendo game cubes cycledating back to  this title still kicks
a bit off the beaten path of former mario style games luigis mansion was a mixed bag for somethe graphics are dated but the gameplay is still thorough enough to be worth playing
many modern games strive on powerful graphics when dated you realize many of the flaws
the game is mysterious mild paced overall good fun
the game itself can be completed rather quickly but the first play through is highly memorablecontrols are a little stiff and there are no technical levels
mario games emphasized level based objectives
while luigis mansion still has objectives they are unlocked by further progression
the objectives are to rid a mansion of ghouls
to do so you are given a vacuum designed specifically for absorbing such ghosts
the variety in ghost is nice the scenery is plot specific but changes when prompted
mario has disappeared luigi gained a mansion coincidencei found few last generation titles to still hold a candle to modern titles the timeless ones are now proving themselves
this game is fairly unique and offers a different style of gameplay
out of the gamecube titles track some other good ones that are rather cheap now
try out also paper mario  pikmin    phantasy star online eps    and lastly thisluigis mansion was a launch title for the nintendo gamecube
the game introduced the last famous mario brother in a whole new light by having him rescue mario
while the gameplay is very fun and the game itself is highly original the short amount of time it took to beat the game really puts into the question whether it is worth a lot of money to purchase
if you ever get a chance to play tis game do not hesitate
it is tons of fun
but if you have to pay  for it then i would find something else to play in the meantimeill start off by telling the storyone day luigi receives a message from mario saying that hes won a mansion but luigi doesnt remember ever enterng a contest so luigi needs to meet mario at this mansion but when he arives mario is nowhere to be found and the mansion is crawling with ghosts so luigi needs to extinquish the mansion of ghosts and rescue his brotherthis game is defintely not perfect but is still pretty goodbought this for my little brother since he is obsessed with luigi
he loves it but i think its kind of repetitive and boring
the setting is awesome and everything its just a game that is too small for me i guess
im used to playing the big games that have places you can explore but this game just didnt really do it for me
not a bad game though by any means
its fun to play all the way through but it isnt something i would play again after i beat iti was absolutely blown away by the graphic and sound quality of this game
i loved that the entire game is within one huge castle and that the names of each room pop up when you enter them
and i loved the music room where you use instruments to quotplayquot old super mario bros theme songs
luigi even hums and whistles along nervously to the background musicthe control also is incredible and very naturalfeeling using both joysicks and all the buttonshowever my buddy and i finished it in one night about  hours of playing taking turns on rooms
and after that we had no desire to play anymore
rent this and wait for the first gamecube mario gameluigis mansion
with ghosts a haunted house and a kidnapped mario
sounds pretty scary right
well  not really
but it is pretty cute
ive been a video game fan for years and since the beginning of nintendo in the s luigi hasnt really had his own video game before
it seems mario is always the star
mario is the main character mario rescues the princes gets the girl and luigi is always player number two with the exception of mario brothers  where you can pick luigi as your main character
but for the most part poor luigi has always been shoved off to the sidenot this time
this time mario has gotten himself in some deep stuff and needs rescued himself
thats right mario has been captured by the ghosts and its up to my main man luigi to save the day
you guide luigi through the mansion sucking up ghosts ghostbuster style
ill admit this game can be quite difficult and it took some time to finish
youre in a mansion and several doors are locked
it can be tricky finding your way around even if you do have your map
many of the ghosts can be difficult too
before you can even fight a ghost you have to figure out a way to bring it out of hiding and fight you
finding the exact procedure to get the ghost to come out and fight you can be hard to figure out and battling the ghost can be difficult as wellat the end of the game be prepared to try your patience
it will take some practice to finish this onethis game is very good quality
it deserves to be named after the mario series
it has a reason why it is th in the best selling game list
it has excellent graphics confusable puzzles and plenty of action
i would say this is a   this was my first game and i am not too sorry about that
so if you like puzzles and adventure then dont hesitate to get this gameluigi is delighted to discover he has won a mansion but is not so enthused to find out it is overrun with  ghosts who have trapped mario somewhere inside
but the nutty professor e gadd has developed a machine for capturing these creatures which he calls the poltergust  with the aid of the poltergust luigi sets off in search of his brotherinside the mansion luigi meets the mischievous ghosts who kidnapped his older brother
the ghosts names are cleverly suited to their occupations the pianist is named melody pianistonio and the artist is called vincent van gorebut while the game is quality it is a bit light on quantity
even so luigis mansion is a solid enjoyable little adventure while it lastsluigis mansion is a pretty good game and though not without its flaws is very fun
the graphics for the most part are very good though there are some blurry textures that should have been fixed up before release
the realtime lighting and shadows are quite simply amazing and easily make up for the handful of blurry textures
the boss fights and some of the puzzles you have to solve to fight the subbosses are extremely innovatetive i would like to list some but i dont want to spoil it for those of you who have never played
the biggest problem i have with the game is that it is too short hopfully they will make a longer sequel
in short this is one of the best launch games for the system and is good fun for gamers of all agesi love this game
last summer i played it all the time
this game rockswhile mario gets zillions of games to himself every year its not often that luigi gets his own lead unless you countmario is missingin this lovely little game luigi goes ghostbusting in a haunted mansion one of those scoobydoo types that he has mysteriously won in a competition he didnt even enter
the mansion is crawling with spooks of all kinds but luigi gets help from a crackpot inventor living nearby
now armed with a special vacuum cleaner luigi must clear every room in the mansion by hooveringup spooks and find his missing brother who has apparently vanished insidethe gameplay is simple and very easy to get the hang of
some of the rooms you clean up require some extra investigation and puzzle solving so be sure to check everything i thought the piano room was a cool puzzle to solve and use your gameboy horror to have a good look roundthe graphics in luigis mansion may not be up to the standard ofsuper mario galaxy but theyre still very very smooth and look amazing
some of the sfx look highly realistic and theres no loading times at all between scenes
the music sounds like its been done on a commodore  and doesnt sound all that great but its a cute little theme and i thought it was very funny when luigi would whistle it whenever it wasnt playingthe mansion itself isnt that big and youll finish the game in about a week but when you have this much fun playing it is still worthwhilegraphic bsound bgameplay blasting appeal bluigis mansion is the first game i bought for gamecube and it did not disappoint
the graphics are awesome and the gameplay is smooth
the story is adequate and the level of play is challenging but not frustrating
i usually pass on these kinds of games because i get frustrated not being able to pick up every little nuance of the game
but in luigis mansion the hints are pretty clear
once youve mastered how to suck up ghosts the game is rudimentary
some of the ghosts are harder to lure than others but finding out how to expose their hearts is part of the fun of the game
the last ghost is not too hard to beat and the pomp and circumstance that end the game are ok overall this game is a solid purchase and good addition to any gamecube collectionthis is a good game but it is too bent on collection and repetition kill a ghost collect some money repeat  times fight a boss and repeat but after all this  it is still a prety fun game that has good graphics and would almost look like a cartooney resident evil if u took out luigi and his ghosts well the back ground would
the graphics are goodit seems like the mario brothers are into super magic back packs now becasue each of their latest games contains the new fad maybe mario wante to try out a backpack for himself becasue luigis helped rescue himthis game would be the most fun game ive ever had except for the fact that without a playersguide you wouldnt know what to do
it has the same feel as mario  but with a dark eerie spooky theme
the point is to go around collecting the normal ghosts you usualy see in cartoons the ones that have the sheet over their head the classic boos that have haunted mario for so long and the quotbossesquot portrait ghosts which come in all shapes ages personalities and sizes
once you do something special usually capturing a portrait ghost you get a key
the problem is you dont know where to go once you use the key and do everything
it can get hard especially when there are fake doors in the halls that slam you into wallsluigis mansion may not be a straight up winner but i wouldnt call his first game a loser at all
the replay value is suspect and the one enormous dungeon mansion can grow tiring but the graphics are quite beautiful and the interesting game mechanics are enjoyable
the game is clearly geared for a younger audience but even adult gamers will have some fun
and a note to luigi  get yourself some acting lessons and a girlfriendthe most challenging and fun part of the game is when the power goes outtry and see how many ghosts you can vacuum when that happens try for  or higherits also a lot of fun to catch every boothis is a great game but its too short but its easy enough that you would want to go back a play it again and again this is one of the most inovative games out for gamecube you should buy this when ever you canthis is a good game and is the perfect starter game if you just bought a gamecube but once you beat it  you dont play it again at least for me
this and super smash bros melee were the first games i got with the cube and it didnt take very long to beat it
its a fun game featuring luigi who rarely gets the credit he deserves but its just not hard enough
if it took longer to beat or if it were as fun and innovative as the zelda or mario series i might want to play this more
the main reason i got sick of this game is that the whole thing takes place in the manshion there really is no worlds or temples
really its not as good because it doesnt take that long to explore the whole place
in all this game is more worth renting once or twice until you beat it then buying it
unless you are a cube or mario series fanatic like me this isnt really worth your money just for the fact that its too easy to beatluigis mansion lets marios little green buddie shine in a battle to cleanse a haunted house of ghosts
the graphics really shine in this short but sweet gamelike all classic mario and luigi games this isnt about slaughter and destruction
luigi is trying to help out his friend mario with gorgeous graphics and fun gameplay in the background
luigi is cleansing a haunted house with a vacuum cleaner destroying the ghosts and gathering up lootthe graphics are really great
the dust in the air the mirrors reflecting the lights shining
this game really shows the power of the gamecube
and the game is classic mario with puzzles and thinking over gore and harmon the other hand the game can be over simplistic
its great for kids but for many gamers the game lasts a few days before its over
the replay value once you figure out the puzzles isnt very involvinggreat fun for the younger set and a great way to see the gamecubes graphic powerthis was one of the first games i played on the game cube and i must say its pretty fun
the gameplay will have you hooked and the graphics are very smoothmy only gripe about this game is the simplicity of it but i guess thats a good thing for a kids gamemy overall rating is  out of i sat down and beat this game within  hours
seeing that i had spent  on this game the day it came out with the cube that was something of a disappointment
its an excellent game but at times too easy for its own good
luigis vacuum ability takes some time to get used to but it comes in time
i would probably recommend this game for newbies to the cube or die hard mario fans
with other great games such as the legend of zelda for the cube out there this probably would do you better to rent it
a cute game thoughwhen the maro brothers series was introduced in the s it has been declared as one of the greatest video game series of all time
the feel of the fantasy world has been absolutely supurb and the simpleness of the games make it all worth the while
while everything always has to be around mario this prime example focuses in on marios brother luigi
still this is just the nd game luigi has actually starred in the first one was mario is missing but this game is also like it
it was a big move for nintendo to finally start the gamecube platform games off with marios brother and boy is it compellingluigis mansion the debut platform game for the nintendo gamecube focuses in on luigi getting an flyer claiming he won a contest he didnt enter and now he finds out that he has to hunt down the infamous king boo and all of his ghoulish pals to stop luigi from rescuing mario
the game has well over  rooms to choose from with a whole number of details awaiting in the process including puzzles and the feel of the game
the graphics on this one are a bit similar to what you see on the nintendo  platform but the game is really fast upon the cdrom gaming
i truly must say it is one of the most frightening games ever
even i was nervous from all the vulgar ghosts and goblins in it
still it might be challenging for new gamers but many of them may want super mario sunshine in their actual gamecube game collection insteadhowever the only way you actually can play this one is to find a strategy guide for luigis mansion which is very difficult to find bow that a lot of stores dont really have the game in stock anymore
still if you cant find it you will be wasting almost twenty dollars for this game that is actually exciting
luigis mansion is actually one of the most compelling games out there right now and it is worth the waiting in goldi drooled eye poped and everything else when i played this game but there is one only one problem with it its too dang short
i got to the last boss in  dayswithout a memory card
still a definite renterluigis mansion is the first game for the gc that came out in  just compare the last n game to this game and it is amazing that the graphics became that good in just a short amount of time
it is also to this day the only lugi game that he is used the whole game
i mean this is the first game with a luigi title and u r always luigi in the game
but anyways the purpose of the game is luigi wins a mansion that happeneds to be haunted and u r supposed to save mario that has been kiddnapped by the ghosts and luigi who u r has a vaccumn that sucks the ghosts up and u get either hearts or coins when u suck them up
the more powerful the ghost  the harder is is to suck them up
in order to suck them up u have to shine the flashlight at them and when u see their heart and the health under it u have to be quick to suck them up before they disappear
overall this is a very good stratergy game but however it is not multiplayerdont be fooled that luigis mansion a game that is only good serves as the nintendo gamecubes star title
by now that honor belongs to super smash bros melee and at launch it was held by the likes of rogue squadron  and tony hawks pro skater  here to give you the word on luigis mansion is nintendorks eric denney
its been very difficult to come to a decision on just what to rate luigis mansion
luigi is the closest thing to a mario flagship title that we saw for gamecube launch and the bar has been set almost impossibly high after super mario bros super mario world and super mario  in the end while still a solid game luigis mansion doesnt deserve a spot next to the predecessorsnow that the ugly comparison is out of the way lets examine the merits and faults of luigis mansion in its own right
what we have in luigis mansion is a fun solid adventure title with little to no replay valuewhile the game concept is hardly fresh and indeed been nearly beaten to death by capcom nintendo still manages to pull it off with characteristic grace
using the poltergust vaccum to suck up the ghosts and mastering the timing of using the flashlight or other objects to make the ghosts vulnerable injects a breath of fresh air into the game
at the same time it proves to be a good example of how to properly program a game for the gamecube controler
every button is put to good use and it isnt hard to believe that the game was designed to make the most out of the controller
it wouldnt surprise me at all if future games in the haunted mansion genre start to pick up on some of the controller ideas in future installmentsluigis mansion is a fun game but hardly worth the full retail price
you can rent it once twice or even thrice and have a great time with it
a rental time however is about all the time you need for it
im no game wizard in fact i rather suck at figuring out game puzzles but i breezed through this game effortlessly
i wouldnt call it easy but it isnt more than moderately challenging even at its best
rent it and you take it back satisfied
but there are just too many great gamecube games out now to spend the full on luigis mansiongreat game and it has neat graphics
bowser is the last boss you fight
its also a classic and i dont think youll ever find a game that has luigi alone as the main characterid say this is a fun game
it is a puzzleadventure game in which you catch ghosts using a flashlight and a vaccuum
thats right
a vacuum
despite the plot there is really nothing scary here but there is a good medium difficulty adventure
catching ghosts means exposing their weak spot and then vacuuming them in a fishing style
buy it used or rent it
its very shortluigi crawls out from marios shadow to star in his own game luigis mansion
unfortunately luigis triumphant return is well not so triumphantfor those of you expecting this to be another platformer along the lines of super mario brosworld will be sorely disappointed
this game is more like luigi meets ghostbusters as he tries to find mario in a haunted mansion with nothing more than a ghost vacuum
dont get me wrong this game is insanely fun once you get accustomed to the awkward gamecube controls but the game ends almost as fast as it starts
it can be completed in less than  hours and offers almost nothing in replay value since the puzzles do not change during the second playthroughthe graphics and sounds are both fantastic worthy of of a gamecube title
luigi has various expressions on his face that change depending on his mood and virtually everything in the house has its own movement and can be interacted with
he also calls out marios name and starts whistling to the background music with a shaky voice throughout the course of the game
its easy to see that a lot of attention was paid to detailsthis game is a great gamecube title that may not be what people expected but still worth the price of admission
if gaming one night stands dont bother you then give luigis mansion a tryok its true this game is pretty short
it has four main areas to defeat each with a ghost boss to fight
still there are a few goodies our friends at nintendo stuck in there to keep us busy
there are  boo ghosts that you must hunt down to gain bonus points after you beat the game
you can look for marios  missing clues you can go hunting for the  treasure rooms and the rare golden cheese
with all that said more about those  areas
each area has a number of sub bosses that must be defeated for keys to open doors
there are about  of these ghosts all together
once the game has reaches the th area limit the manion goes dark and stays like that untill the section is completed
this part is pretty scary
to top is off the final boss is very very very very very hard
so dont expect to have him beaten in one day
it took me a week just to beat him
once the game is over your total score ir ranked by how much money you found all the boos you found all the bosses and sub bosses you defeted and any other bonus items you have
the higher your total the better yout letter grade will be
once you have your rank you get a sort of new masion
the higher you yout rank the better and nicer the new mansion looks
there isnt a huge diffenrce with the game once you play it with the new look but it still makes you feel proud you did it
to wrap it up the game is kinda short but still is an instant classic that is bound to be up with donkey kong countrysnes and mario luigis mansion is a fun game starring luigi who won a mansion in a contest he never entered
problem is this mansion is crawling with ghosts and mario who went into the mansion earlier hasnt been heard from since
so it is up to luigi to rid the mansion of ghosts and find out what happened to his brotherthe game consists of luigi exploring the many dark rooms of the mansion which is four floors and fighting ghosts using a flashlight to stun them and a special vacuum called the poltergust  to suck them up
this is a very creative way to fight enemies that i enjoy very much in this game
its a nice departure from jumping on enemies like you do in countless other mario games
the vacuum can also eventually shoot fire water and ice later on in the game as well
i also really like that until the lights come on youre exploring these dark rooms with a flashlight as your only source of light
its a bit spooky but luckily not in a creepy wayanyway as you explore the mansion you find keys to get to new rooms lots of money and a variety of ghosts
there are regular ghosts boos like from previous games and portrait ghosts which are special ghosts who hide their weak point extra well and so may take a little thinking to defeat
i think there is an interesting variety of portrait ghosts who are actually people rather than just random enemies like the other ghosts
it kind of gives a little extra bit of story to the game like how the butler has a crush on the piano player and the granny likes playing jokes on people
it just made the game more interesting than simply capturing nothing but nameless ghostsbesides the ghosts it is also fun looking for money which can be hidden anywhere like in furniture or secret rooms or even secret ghosts or in more clever places such as plants that only give up their hidden money when theyre watered
it gives you a reason to check out every bit of the mansion to try and see how much money you can findanother fun thing is that some things are different depending on how well you do in the game
like the portrait ghost get turned into portraits after each boss battle and the better you do fighting them the nicer the portrait
also at the end of the game luigi has a different mansion built and it is nicer or uglier depending on how much money you found
so that gives you a bit more motivation to do a good job with certain parts of the gamea few last comments
the graphics look nice and there isnt much to the music but it fits the game well nonetheless
the game is pretty short but the good thing about that is the game never really gets boring
it may not have lasted long but i certainly had fun the entire time
because its short i dont know if the game is really worth as much as its selling for but it is certainly a fun and unique game if you can get itthis game really shows off the capability of the gamecube
reflections in mirrors seethrough ghosts and more
the levels are intricate and involved but easy enough for the younger crowd to handle
my  year old loves the fun of trying to find and vacuum the ghosts up
i got addicted real quick
the only down side personally was that i completed the game relatively quickly
it takes me awhile to finish games but i had this one licked in no time
my son is still working on his game though
a great game but there are better for the gamecubei see and hear a lot of criticism laid on luigis mansion but i thought it was more enjoyable than his brothers sunshine game i grew tired of washing things
luigis game does a good job of creating a scaryyetcartoonish atmosphere to immerse yourself into and its fun to goround sucking ghosts into your vacuum cleanerof course no game is perfect and the flaw here is that the fun only lasts  hours but i figure id rather have a short solid title than one that pads the game with long stretches of boredom cough  wind waker
resident evil  is only  hours long too but i still consider it the best survivalhorror game to date
its short but solid and so too is luigis mansionrecommended buyit is great that nintendo gamecube made a luigi game mario has been kidnapped and luigi has to save him
but the game lacks mario characters peach toadsworth yoshis ectthe game itself very fun and entertaining but a tad too easy
i rented this game twice in a row for a total of  and  days of being able to play it and unfortunetely i didnt complete it
i got all by myself very rarely found myself wondering what to do as i said too easy and got to the boss battle before king boo which is  the other big boo
lol
i was  boo away from beating the boss
i know if i could have had one more day with the game i would have been able to complete it
i looked at a walkthrough cuz i wont be able to play the rest of the game anyway and the rest last area area  would have been really easy but unfortunetely i have to return the game soon
less than  hr i think the boss battle king boo would have been tricky sadly i will never see the ending of the game i spent  total on renting the game for  days and im not going to buy the game now
i mean if i was going to do that i wouldnt have rented it in the first placenext replay value
the replay value is fair
there is only  reason i would not have fun playing it over again is there are way too many ghosts to vaccum it is tiring
but other mario titles like paper mario and paper mario thousand year old door  have much better replay value than this game does i can play those two over and over again and not get tired of them
but playing luigis mansion again i would get really tired of it
that is why i suggest renting it first then if you love the game buy it
many of my other n and gamecube games have better replay value then this one
but this is still a great game the first time you play iti just wish i could have finished it and seen the ending oh well
but that is my advice rent it first then if you like it buy it
i like it but since the replay value in my opinion is so poor i dont want to buy itby the way at least i found mario even if i didnt get to save him
lolhappy gamingwhen it was released with the launch of the nintendo gamecube in  luigis mansion took both praise and criticism for being an atypical launch game for the new system
both viewpoints are valid depending on what type of gamer you might bebasically this game puts you in control of the usually secondfiddle luigi who is searching for brother mario in a haunted mansion full of boos
armed with a ghostsucking vacuum device luigi must suck up all the ghosts and get his fellow plumber out of the house of horrorsin terms of gameplay this game gets old quickly
basically you just go around sucking up ghosts and getting keys to rooms tosuck up more ghosts
its fun for awhile but gets tedious after about the first  ghosts or sothe presentation however is what makes this game still fun to play even  years after its inception
the graphics are perfect for this type of game cartoony yet clean while the humor of many of the situations is pitchperfect
because luigi is such a quirky character in the nintendo cannon there isnt that mario pressure and thus the game developers were just able to let things loose and have a little fun with this oneoverall luigis mansion is a fun game because of not in spite of its quirkiness
younger gamers will especially love this effort as the gameplay will never feel stale for their skill set
more seasoned gamers will just laugh at the presentationatmosphere and take the goofiness all in stride
id give it  stars to be exact but it gets bumped up to four full stars here because it is just so innocent and funhonestly i did
but not in the beginning
when this game was at the pique of my interest i enjoyed it as much as the firstthe first however the music i believe was more memorableand it was sunnier
im a pretty upbeat person but im also realthat may sound like it adds nothing to the review but when i played the first i liked the sunny levels to only get the drearier and more complexmusically levels once in a while in betweenif i recall correctly this game had more dreary levels which was fine but something about the first games levels sunny beach dolphin park etc etc were a bit better
maybe its because i played the first first
maybe notthe music was much brighter and poppy then if you willthis game does do some things better howevercharacter amount grew from a measly  to the graphics are better
duhthe rumble made it more realistic starsend note now this is what i call an underrated game
maybe an underrated series
no one that i knew could handle these games like i could
no one wanted to
and if they did they were too young like a cousinso i played both alonethe first wasnt rumbleenabled like star fox  was itunderrated game works greattwo things about this game stand out above everything else control
right out of the gate you should know that this game has a big learning curve in controlling the jetski
some people who play the game for  minutes put the controller down and complain of stiff steering but guess what
a real jetski cant turn on a dime either and neither should these
what you have here is truly realistic jetski racing and if you stick with it and learn how to control your racer youve got a really rewarding experience ahead of you graphics
the games water looks simply amazing
they really went all out in creating the wave physics in this game the waves ripple ebb and flow just like real water
its not perfect sometimes the water seems ltigttooltigt crystal clear and it lacks enough reflections on the surface to make it totally photorealistic
but it is truly a thing to see and the important thing is that the wave physics make the racing experience all that much more realisticif you enjoy racing games dont pass this one up
its the best water racing game ive played on any of the three systemsthis game rocks
good graphics and music
the waves and weather conditions are really realistic
you can either race or have trick compeditions
p is even more fun
a nice selection of characters each with different  and  adds some statagie to the game
the only thing i dislike is that there arent any secret characters or anything
there are some special areas though and by entering the right passwords you can even try riding a dolphin
if you like realistic racing games you wont be able to keep your hands off this onethis is a really really good looking game and it plays great too
it seems to be a little short on courses but the different weather conditions make up for itits a lot like the first game which is something i am starting to say a lot with gamecube titles
i hope this isnt the case for too longbut anyway its great fun and has huge waves and accurate physics effects
most of the new tricks are really lame though
left can can right can can nac nac
the multiplayer is great though never any slowdown at alllike fun sports action
wave race  blue storm brings fun jetski wave riding to the game cube with gorgeous water graphicssports games on consoles need to draw you into the competition
wave racer does this nicely with a variety of characters to choose from and a series of very different race areas
there are fun stunts to do different race tracks a variety of environmental conditions
theres fun music toothe graphics as i mentioned are really amazing
water is one of the hardest things to code  its fluid dynamic and changes near you affect objects further away ripples splashes etc
wave races does a phenomonal job with waves seethrough water and the rest
there are still a few bizarre flaws  try to do a barrel roll over the sand and when you fall off you climb up out of the depths of the sand back onto your racera great escapist fantasy of blue waters and warm sandsyou can get three new levels
once you beat it you get the weather changer
each level is fun and has shortcuts
the bad thing about this game is that you have to go around the yellow and red booies
i like this game but i would rather have ssx tricky
at least its better than that stupid dark summit and pacman world heres a minireview of wave race blue storm brought to you by the fine folks at nintendorksquotwith any console launch game companies are apt to bring a successful series into the nextgeneration making full use of all the new graphical advantages while trying to retain that stellar gameplay core
nintendo has done just that with the release of wave race blue storm the sequel to the nearlaunch n version released five years previous
but rather than develop the game internally nintendo handed the series to nst responsible for the underrated ridge racer  one of the many development houses in its vast secondparty lineupthose expecting a radical shift in design from the first game will be greatly disappointed blue storm follows the wave race model closely as the game exhibits a very similar ideology in terms of track design control and basic gameplay mechanics
but once you get over that you will find what makes blue storm so special a control system that has been finetuned to perfection a dynamite weather system and a water and wave dynamic that is simply unparalleled on any other console
throw in a plethora of excellent modes and some new gameplay additions turbo boost and the message becomes clear wave race blue storm is simply one of the most wellcrafted and defining games that the gamecube has to offer at launchthere are those who might be quick to point out that wave race blue storm is remarkably similar to its counterpart and there is only one response to these criticisms theyre right
there is no denying that nst has not radically changed the basic nature of the game
but there is also no denying that blue storm is simply a superbly designed racer
the spoton control and varying weather are the games big calling cards and blue storm delivers these elements in shining form
coupled with striking graphics an excellent multiplayer mode and incredibly realistic water motion these components come together to make one congealed mass of fun
this is an impressive debut for nst on the gamecube and they could have done no better job than preserve the legacy of the wave race series so perfectly with blue stormquoti have owned wave race for n since the month that it came out
and that is a great game
but wave race blue storm is even better
however if you do not own wave race for n i would not reccomend this game to you
it is very difficult to catch on and if you really want to learn the tutorial is rather boring
i love the huge challenge of this game and if you are a big racing challenge lover this could be the game for you even if you do not have it for n
one major difference is that in this wave race the levels change dramatically from one difficulty to the next
once you unlock hard and expert i can garentee it will take you a pretty long time to beat it
in terms of graphics im sure youve heard that its great
in terms of  player action the  player stunt is a great addition
also if you really want to be good at this game take advantage of the free roam selection to look around the whole level for secrets with no time limit
after all without shortcuts wave race blue storm is an average gamethe creator of mario has done it again with a game that is sure to sell plenty of gamecubes over the next few months
this game is beautiful and very technically impressive but at the same time leaves you begging for moreyou are marooned on a planet and need to find  different parts for your space ship but with only a limited time to do so
you have  days in the game that are really  minute segments in realtime
you use small mindless creatures called pikmin that each have seperate qualities and abilities who aid you in your questthe best part of this game is the difficulty
the game is never too hard or really stumps you but it also never gets too easy or repetitive
it has the perfect mix of strategy and action all doused in gorgeous graphics and controloverall i would suggest this game for anyone who has a good  hours to blow with their shiny new gamecube
who wouldnt trust the creator of mariopikmin
this game is a nintendo classic
pure genius and quite original
you basicly build an army kill things to build a bigger army to help you get the parts back for your broken shipwatch out though cause time is of the essence
the animation and graphics are beautiful and the gmaeplay is easy for even the newest gamerthis is quite the gamemy friend got this game for his birthday
i played it at his house for no less than six to eight hours
i was absolutely obsessed
it was so fun and addictive challenging and puzzling and so much
all the stuff you can expect from my buddy miyamotoohexcept for the fact that i so exitedly bought a gcube pikmin and luigis mansion and strategy guides for each the next day
which is good but i completely beat the game in a day
buy the game
its great
but be reasonable and dont play it too muchshigeru miyamoto is the owner of a fertile imagination
very few who know his name will argue that point and fewer still will argue the quality of his work
as perhaps the greatest asset still under nintendos grasp his fame is surprisingly lowkey
little more than the most hardcore gamers know of his existence but everyone whos ever seen a joystick has a pretty extensive knowledge of his creations
super mario brothers
donkey kong
the legend of zelda
mario kart
fzero
starfox
super smash brothers
it reads like a top ten list of nintendos greatest achievements and it all stems back to one man
so naturally when this guys motivated to flesh out a new idea its a pretty newsworthy eventsuch was the circumstance when pikmin was revealed to the world near the launch of the gamecube in late  it was promoted as the systems quotmusthavequot launch title a role in which any of the famed creators previous titles would have soared
unfortunately pikmin isnt a game id classify as a cornerstone in any sense of the word which is what nintendo desperately needed at that point in time
every bit of the miyamototrademarked addictive gameplay uncensored originality and effortless simplicity is here in full force but the game never took off because of the way it was marketed
as an understated unheralded underground success released a year or two after the firstwave launch titles this game would have taken the gaming world by storm
as the central focus of a nextgen console it was horribly misplaced and along with nintendo itself quickly lost in the shufflewhich is a shame because this is a really enjoyable little package
it tackles a number of cliches that have plagued the gaming scene for years gathers several completely unrelated genres and produces a game that youve never seen anything even remotely like
it successfully proves that higher framerates larger numbers of polygons and faster processors havent completely eliminated the kind of light hearted inexplicably believable experience that used to fill every game on the old nes and atarithis isnt the best looking game on the market nor does it need to be
the real magic of pikmin is in its simplicity which is something thats wisely protected by keeping the games environments understated and clean
it is a little disconcerting to see how flat some of the textures are upon close inspection but since the majority of the game is played from a distant overhead perspective this is a minor qualm at best
the pikmin olimar and the enemies however skirt this issue as theyre all composed of flat colors with little noticeable detailing at all
and though that sounds like a blatant red flag its done consistently enough to ward off any presumptions that this might have been done as a last second method of cutting corners
this is a title that appears exactly as it was meant to with the tiny brightly colored creatures appearing eerily at home amongst the familiar photorealistic blades of grass twigs and soil
its funny the graphics of pikmin fluctuate so easily between distinct realism and blatant oversimplification that the lines themselves start to blur
it becomes the meeting point between detail and simplicity with an end product thats all the more believable because of thatupon his discovery of the pikmin olimar also discovers their undying need to follow his direction
unless he tells them otherwise nearby pikmin will follow our central character around the world
theyll put their lives on the line to defend him from much larger adversaries
theyll build bridges for him or carry enormous objects with the proportionate strength of an ant if itll aid his journeys
that the games writers chose not to elaborate on these tiny creatures undying love for the titles main character makes it all the more interesting and open for interpretationwhether they fall into the river and drown attempt to run through a fountain of fire or stupidly assault the largest enemy in the forest on their lonesome you will lose pikmin in the field on a regular basis which becomes a point of agony as the game progresses
its strange to imagine but after spending the time to create uproot and command these little creatures you develop a sort of parental attachment to them which eventually becomes the real attraction as the hours go on
its truly disturbing to watch a large forest creature devour a handful of them in one fell swoop and thats an emotion i dont usually get from playing a video gameits this element of survival mixed with a brief thirty day timeframe a game day lasts about half an hour and a series of mindteasing difficult puzzles that really gives pikmin its substantial appeal
theres a definite lemmings vibe to some of the levels both with their simplicity and their nervewracking addictive nature
youll spend hours upon hours trying to sort your way through a particularly difficult puzzle only to discover the answer was right in front of your face the whole time
everything is arranged to follow a blatant learning curve but it never really seems to get in the way or detract from the overall pictureas i said before pikmin wouldve made a great second or third year addition to the gamecubes lineup
its a much deeper game than the simplified graphics of the front cover would lead you to believe always there to inspire thought rather than to sate your appetite for gratuitous violence
it straddles the action  adventure strategy and puzzle genres and stands head and shoulders above the leading titles in each category today
its a deceptively addicting little package and though it lacks a bit in length and replay value its more than worth the current asking price
theres a very solid concept here which i hope to see fleshed out a little further in the forthcoming sequelfirst of all this game is fun
collecting three colors of little alien pikmin to kill enemies and get ship parts is fun
but there are a few problems
first of all only  minutes a day
yes
there is only  minutes each day and only  days
why
it made me more hesistent to play this game
it was as if  wrong move and it was the end
be prepared to repeat days lot
other than that it is pretty gooda fun and original game that will supply fun for hours
pikmin is about an astronaut who crash lands on a strange planet and must rebuild his ship with the help of some weird creatures he calls pikmin
he only has about a month to find all the lost parts before his life support system runs out
this game is fun and the strategie is challenging
the only thing i dont like is having a time limit though then again it would stink without one
overall if you like strategie games and dont feel pressured by timelimits this is the game for youa great game the first time around but it begins to lose its replay value after a couple of plays
its a great game however and id recommend at least renting it
its a good buy toopick this up
i just got this game and im regretting i didnt pick it up sooner
now i cant wait for the second one
they need some more difficult enemies and more variety of pikmin but other than that this game is great
this should be a first buy for anyone with a gamecube highly recommended just because its so different from everything elseyoud think a game like pikmin would only be for some sweet little five year olds
but its not
pikmin involves strategic desciscionsyour ship has just crashed
and your name is captain olimar
you land on a mysterious island where you find creatures that you later name pikmin
as the game goes on youll meet different kinds of pikmin
redyellow and blue they do things for you
such as there is a huge wall so you tell  of your pikmin to break it down
you can also fight lady bugs with your pikmin
the point of killing the ladybugs is to bring them back to a ship your pikmin go in and then a certain amount of pikmin come out
you can also get more pikmin from finding blocks having a number on it
when you bring those to the pikmins spacecraft it sprouts you whatever the number was on the block
dont worry that it takes a million years to sprout because it doesnt
it actually takes around five secondsoh yeah i forgot that the whole meaning of this game is find and repair your ship by going to different islands to find pieces to your ship
in all you begin without  pieces that you need to find in thirty daysmy word
originality
i thought i remembered that from the presony daysits amazing the games that came to mind when i tried to think of how to describe this one
others will find better comparisons but im thinking of it currently as a cross between toejam  earl pokemon and even age of empires
well you can command a big army with different types of soldier and have to use varying strategies against particular kinds of enemies
i applaud shiggy and his cohorts for this truly original and fun game
please ignore the onestar review below me im fairly certain miyamotos curse only applies to those who were expecting mario brothers  mario takes three steps to the rightyeah its a bit short when you get right down to it which is why i only give it four stars
but still youll have to expend some serious brain matter to finish this one
either that or the money for a guidebook
still theres the challenge mode to keep you entertained long after youve finished the game propergames like this are the reason i took up with the gamecube after the demise of sega nintendo and shiggy still appear to care about the games as opposed to the money and surely thats what video games should be all about isnt iti have waited for this game for a long time but to tell you the truth i expected alot more from nintendo to start off id like to say the controller for gamecube is horrible they should have left the same one for n putting  analog sticks was just more trouble and the z button being on top is alot harder to control
this is a cool game with more than  trophies to collect with many different and exciting modes
new charcters and more hidden characters the levels are good with a very good soundtrack
but then again lets get to the controls the combos in this game are not as good as in super smash brothers for n smash attacks are much harder to do in this game because you must tap the joystick very lightly its hard to do that seeing how loose it is
but the game itself is great the graphics are truly amazing and you will have fun for hours
i would have given this a  but its hard to adapt to these controls in time it will get easier but for now  stars form mei loved the n version of super smash bros there were some things i would change but i could play that for hours and never get bored
i got this game becuase i thought it would be better then the n version
in some ways it is but i just cant get into it like i did on the old one
certain things like getting trophies are worthless to me
however you do get to play mini games and there are tons more options on multiplayer and items as well
overall its fine but its just not something i care forthis game is one of the best games for gc and at an awsome price
i first played the old one at my friends house last summer and when i played this one i was really happywhen you play in this game the graphics acually made your experience more fun
there are many hidden secrets to some of the levels
and they can be useful or harmful to your charactermy friends and i always put it on camera mode and go to the hyrule temple and play link gandorf and zeldasheik
we come up with awsome pictures and we make up our own storylines
its really coolthe one player can get boring but when doing it for trophies then its kind of worth itoverall there are more things that make this game awsome but i really cant say for i dont own the game
im hoping to buy it soon now that is cheeperif you liked the first smash bros then get ready for melee
its not entirely new think of this game as an upgraded version of the original
with  characters to play most of whome have to be unlocked the game play can get alot more diversewith the same premise of the original a slew of nintendo characters come together to kock eachother off the board
while the play is nearly identical to the n version there are alot more features this time around that make playing this version more enjoyableone of the addicting aspects of this game is collecting trophies
every character prop and reference from many nes games are recreated as a trophie you can win
they arent easy to get and thats whats so much funthe only con i can see is unlocking certain levels and characters
to get mewtew you have to rack up over  vs games
likewise you have to have over  vs games in order to unlock the remaining  levels
for someone who is playing by themselves this can get rather tedious and it will take a very long time
other characters wont be unlock unless youve played  hours or moreaside from this smash bros goes to show that a sequal can still have the same controls characters and gameplay and yet be entirely new and exciting
i highly recomend getting this game to add to your collectionps its the best with  playersi dont actually own this title any more but i regret selling it for 
it was a nice game one of the best for gamecube it had extraordinary graphics and it showed what the gamecube could do but the gameplay was sligthly diffrent so abnormal compared to the first it seemed the games went by faster and were boringfor one it seemed the character fell down faster then normal and for two the moves seem to be performed faster and smoother then the originali feel this change was for the worst the gameplay was way better in the original and  player is nice and long and gives lots of stuff to explore while completing this gamethe original is way better for multiplayer this sequal is nice for the one who plays alonei played this game with my friend nic brand but i beat it just the same
i think that this game was great because i like fighting games
i am a fan of the cap com vs games
this is like thoseto start off this is under the genre of a fighter but it is so much more than that
great multiplayer mode soooo much to unlock  characters  stages  event maches which are actually very fun  trophies to earn find collect and buy  player modes  if training stadium and event match are counted  stadium modestarget test  smash ten targetshomerun contest  smash sand bag as far as you canmultiman melee  fight for you life
fight regular  player matches areclassic  defeat each foe to advanceadventure  clear a stage from a classic franchise like sidescrolling mushroom kingdom than fight boss to advanceallstar  defeat all characters with  life on normal this can get tough on hard or very hard its hard or veryhard
and on either of the easy settings its just boringthe characters aredr mariomarioluigiprincess peachbowseryoshidonkey kongcaptain falconganondorffalco lambardifox mccloudnessice climberskirbysamusprincess zeldalinkyoung linkpichupikachujigglypuffmewtwomr
game amp watchmarthandroyplus over a dozen multiplayer modesthe game also sounds great
the in game graphics are very good but not the best
but if you pause it and zoom in on a character it just looks fantastic
and when you first put this dist in dont touch the controller the opening sequence is nothing less than beutifuljust buy this game its worth the s
i looked at my timer when i wrote this review ive played for  hours and im still having fun of course after unlocking all characters and levels which will take between  and  hours you will need to play with friends to stay interestedwell this is another masterpiece by nintendo
this game juust like the original is very fun and original
here is the low downgraphicsawesome
all the characters look like they were taken from their original games and put in this game
the arenas are also very original and cool looking
agameplay best cartoon fighting game hands down
all your favorite characters are included and you could just play for hours
you just get hooked
awesomefun factor a  if possible
absolutly the best
nintendo has created a masterpiece that will go down as one of the best games everthis is my review hope it was helpful
a must buyin ssb nintendo really outdid themselves to make sure they made a fivestar fighting game
i dont want to take up too much of your time so heres my short reviewgraphics fantastic
there are so many things to see the fire in bowsers breath is extremely authentic nintendo even bothered to put in marios teeth
gameplay ah its okay
if it only werent so darn fastpaced sound great
great
great
thats all i can say
overall  out of i dont know how anyone couldnt give this game  stars
its so unbelivibly fun and it never gets old
if you get tired of normal mode try the tiny mode or giant mode
theres so many fun characters and fun levels
this has to be one of the best games ever created
i belive it has a better multiplayer mode then mario party  games usually dont get this good so get this game soon and start having funaccording to my kids this is the coolest game but personally if you have vertigo id advise against it
the game performs really well no glitches in the programming that ive witnessed but the graphics can be overwhelming
also the music is so repetitive and there is no option to turn it off
and like all other game cube games  i find this a bit expensiveplay as a number of different nintendo characters such as mario yoshi and link in a wide variety of places
collect money to win trophies in a lottery
the graphics are stunningly crisp vibrant and engaging
the game is entertainig enough on one player but twice as much fun on muilty player mode
only one warning its addictivethis game is awesome im always unlocking something
but there are  characters who really should be in this game wario and waluigi
there are the ice climbers marth and mrgamewatch
 but not mario and luigis evil counterpartsheres a trick to unlock mewtwo
it takes  hours of gameplay to unlock old  youll need  controllers to pull this off
go into vs modes custom rules and set them option to stock and the stock to  now go into the item switch and turn off all the items
exit and enter the melee mode
start up a vs match between  characters
and choose yoshis islandyoshis story because the stage doesnt change
walk awaygo to sleep just let it run for  hours then have your other  players walk off the screen
mewtwo will challenge you
beat mewtwo and its selectablethis is a great game
the first time i played this game was actually at toys r us and then i played it at my friends house
i liked it so much i begged my parents to get it for me and eventually they did
i play it all the time
i have all of the characters
i enjoy playing this game with my friends and kicking their butts
i love this gamethis is one of the best games i have ever played
the amazing detail in the characters is obvious but the backgrounds need work
which is why i gave it  stars and the replay value is unsurpassed with  trophies featuring rare games from japan and nostalgic trophies from old famous nes and snes charactersplacesweaponsetc
the secret characters could have been better i cant believe how much luigi stinks at fighting and the rest are just copies of the regular characters
this game needs a bit more variety
nevertheless still a classic and a musthave in my booklong replay value the side quests are very intense you will spend months playing this game to unlock characters and areas  to beat everything in this game it could take yearsi love this game
it is currently one of the best games on nintendo gamecube
although it is a lot like its n predecessor super smash bros it has a lot of new levels and a whole lot of new hidden and default characters
there is also the brandnew adventure mode where you go through mariolike minilevels
during the courses in adventure mode you occasionally reach an area where you have to fight someone
its pretty cool
there are also some new items
check out the man melee for a challenge
try it out if youre a fan of super smash bros or even if youre just looking for an entertaining gamethis is a good game but its alittle kiddy its worth the  bucks but it gets kind of old if u want fun and u love the nintendo charators buy this gamei got this game with my first gc for my th birthday
super smash bros melee is the full title but for the purposes of typing im going to sum it down to ssbmthe good points of this game include its characters stages and items
character wise you get a nice selection
theres mario donkey kong link and zelda princess peach yoshi kirby samus and several others
you can unlock other characters like marth and roy from fire emblem ganondorf from the legend of zelda luigi and dr mario and three pokemonalmost every character has their own stage peach has her castle the pokemon have their stadium link and zelda have hyrule castle and termina
of course you can unlock stages like poke floats brinstar depths and big bluerandom items fall from the sky at random times
laser swords poke balls flower sticks boxes barrels invisible disks bobombs and tons of other stuff
if you keep the items option off though it makes fighting a lot easier because you dont get all that junk in the wayyou can also change the type of fight ie you can be tiny or giant fast or slow or ko people in one hit
theres a single player mode where you run through enemy infested stages trying to reach the end where you eventually fight the boss a giant white glove
you also earn coins for fighting and with those you can buy trophies of just about everything nintendo related
the more coins you put in the better the trophyi became very bored with this game after unlocking all the characters and getting every trophy so i took it to game stop and traded it in for mortal kombat
ssbm is great for kids  and under who love nintendo
theres no blood or gore and controls are very simpleeverything came intact and in good condition
game worked just fine with my only problem being that the loading times took a little longer than i expectedit arguably is so amazing how people really dig those one vs one fighting games
arguably theyve remained just as controversial and as much fun since back in the late s
arguably for nintendo they adequately did find a way to cash in on the fun with a one vs one combat game for the n called super smash brothers
arguably the game was fair but easily boring for one player where if you were playing with somebody else it would increase in the game of life
well nintendo had to really consider improving the game to make it better for the gamecube back in  well they did and it is fiercer than eversuper smash brothers melee for the nintendo gamecube is a unique one vs one combat game that like before putting regulars and favorites from nintendo past and present against each other in a battle of the best with returning favorites like mario link from the legend of zelda and kirby to name a few
the game also adds a little more fire with additions like the vile bowser the sweet and cute yoshi metroid and peach just to name a few
the game does thrill a little more with more arenas and zones like mute city from the fzero franchise the innocent woods from kirbys dream land and others just to tell a bit
the games graphics are delightful and it is easy to manuever
still it does take awhile for some of the more advanced moves to get used to but they are simple to fight withwhile many fighting games have come and gone for other systems nintendo has remained constant for the gamecube with the super smash brothers melee
this has been a pure delight for gamecube owners and is sure to be a must have for anybody who loves combat games
if you dont have a gamecube and want this game go out and purchase the recent nintendo gamecube bundle pack which has super smash brothers meleegraphics bsound b control b fun  enjoyment bprice boverall bthis game was fun
i thought it was very well done
my little brother who is  still plays it today
the graphics are very very good
i recommend this to youpros
 well known nintendocharacters like mario link pikachu and kirby
many cool arenas
 missions in event mode
one of the greatest multiplayer games ever
the sound comes from classic nintendogames like super mario bros the legend of zelda pokemon stadium and dr mario
many trophies to collectallstar mode and classic mode rocks
fun minigames like break the target and racecons
pichu roy dr mario gannondorf falco and young link are just copies of pikachu marth mario capt
falcon fox and link
i arenas like big blue and icecle mountain you dont get to figth that much because the arena is moving so you are busy trying to save youre ass
yoshi peach and iceclimbers are too weak or to hard to play whit
it takes ever to unlock mewtwo and mr game and watch
adventure mode is too boringthis is a lot better than the original with new features like adventure mode home run contest multiman melee event match special melee and trophies
the original player mode classic has different battles everytime thank god and a new bonus round where you collect new trophies by kickin them in a bucketthing
event match is a cool idea but quickly gets tedious as you have to complete them all to unlock certain areascharacters blablablaspecial melee is a life saver for this game since it adds a fun dimension to vs modethe graphics are great the new characters they added were ok choices
the replay value
endless in vs mode almost none for adventure mode the same every time
overall a good game to buyi was very impressed by this gameand i liked the original one anyway here are my usuall pros and consprosexcellent graphicsgreat battle modesplayer actionawesome soundmany places levels and characters to unlock and play inmany different battle modes to choose froma new adventure mode which is awesomejust when the game gets boring a new foe has appearedgreat game to play with your mom bro kid or dad
fun for all including you in player or   or playerconsafter a long time when you unlock everything it gets kind of boringplayer vs mode is a lil too easyfirst few players you can play as have such a low  of attacks they repeat themselves a lotsome characters are just a pain to unlocki was prepared to give this game  star because i played it for the first time today and i thought quotthis game is stupidly easyquot then i realized the game was preset on quotvery easyquot so that explained things
my first impressions of the game is that it has the most beautiful graphics i have ever seen
theres not a single flaw i could find
the colors are bright and vibrant and the characters are very well detailed
however the pitfall to this game is the loose controls
theyre too simple to be a good fighting game and too loose to be a good platformer
in this fighting game youre asked to sometimes perform some difficult jumping and while thats not the toughest thing in the world to do it should be a lot easier
street fighter its not
the game is huge though and offers a lot to a single player or multiplayers
the game creators thought of everything
even putting a mini star fox type game during the credits
if only this game had better controls it would be a perfect gamegraphics control sound fun factor if youre looking for a multiplayer game then look no further
super smash bros melee is an all out bash with new characters old characters adventure mode multiplayer hidden treatslike sound test trophies and of course fun
you can choose any out of atleast  different characters to smash n bash your opponent
the only unfun part is that it is multiplayer so if you have no one to destroy it gets boring but luckily it has adventure mode
some hidden caracters jigglypuff drmario pichu luigi and young link dont think ill spoil the surprise of finding characters but i have heard that if you get all the characters a certain wacko character will apearok this game is one of the most playbly games ever it is so dun to the all youre very charters from link to mario they is a lot of fun to have here
but once you have beat the game game with every one it gets old
but then the multy play opiton has a lot ofun to it
sow if you wount a fun game you go out and bye this game you will like itthis game is great in many ways but full of flawsrushed to productionmuffled sounding announcerclone charactersglitchesoverpowered and underpowered very unbalanced charactersdispite all of that it is one of the gamecubes better games but def not better than todays smash bros brawlthe camecube to many was a dissapointment but games like smash brothers gave the cube what little leverage it had to offer
when you look back at fighting games a lot of people love this franchise
this game came packed in with my cube when i got it back in  and its one of the few games i actually go back and replay
the game is just pure fun
there is no story you just brawl in matches and pimp slap your opponents around with a selection of moves and it works
longevity wise theres plenty of characters and trophies to unlock to keep you busy for a whilepros  addictive gameplaylarge roster of charactersfor being an early cube game it still has good graphicscons  no story whatsoever repetitive after an hour or sothe game is good just probably not for everyonewithout this game i doubt i wouldve ever brought the gcn
this game was the main reason why i brought the gcn
other than racing and rpgs which are my favorite genre of video games this is my only favorite fighting game that i love
my favorite part of this game other than collecting trophies from nintendos past is knocking the stuffing out of everybody with my favorite character luigi yeah thats right luigi
the graphics are great especially the final destination battlefield which was breathtaking
for graphics i would give it 
the controls were great which also deserve a 
the music was da bomb especially with the sound test option you can unlock the sound test option by uncovering all of the characters and secret stages and getting the marin trophy
as other people have said your gcn collection isnt complete unless you have this gameactually i gave it   stars but since they dont give fractions i just put if you liked the nintendo  version theres no way youll dislike this game
mario link yoshi kirby fox pikachu and the rest are back for a rematch in gamecube
almost all of the characters from the n game have come back to this game along with some new faces like zeldasheik the ice climbers peach and bowser
there are  characters to start with and  more to unlock
there are also more than  levels with different hazards that youll have to avoid ie
falling in the water in great bay staying on the turning platform in brinstar depths etc
im so glad they included falco
hes my favorite nintendo character of all timei gave this game  stars because even though the music was amazing and the graphics were superb the controls always get the better of me
i always try to jump by pressing a but i punch instead
plus there are some attacks you have to do by pressing two buttons at the same time or pressing the control stick in one direction and pressing a button with the other hand ie
the reflector attack with fox and falco
some people wont be able to do that very easily
but other than that this game is very fun and im sure youll be addicted to it as i amin conclusion i recommend you buy this gameamy roseeternal darkness is a definite one of a kind game
and thats got to be the best thing going for it
the idea that your character can actually lose their sanity puts an interesting twist on what could have been just another good game
the whole idea and implementation of the sanity effects pushes ed into a class of its ownthe game itself kind of feels like a cross between resident evil and silent hill
with similar control and the d environments
its not as freaky as silent hill but i did at times get some goose bumps from the screams that were in the background when my character was losing it
and there are a variety of different effects that can happen when your character does lose their sanity
but dont let anyone tell you what they are if you plan on playing it yourself it is better to experience them for yourself and be surprisedafter while of losing your sanity and seeing what happens you dont trust the game anymore
an interesting idea
i have never seen a game where i didnt trust what it was showing me
this effect of the sanity is the main selling point i believe in eternal darkness
its a good game even if that wasnt present but it would lose a lot of its punch without itafter a while though you pretty much know when the game is showing you some hallucination and while its neat to watch sometimes you just want it to be over and get on with playing
so you have to heal your sanity levels up quite often
the monsters you encounter drain your sanity by just looking at you and you sanity goes down so fast that you could lose a lot of sanity in a short period of time
this is most likely what the producers had in mind so that your character go insane faster but sometimes you wish that you could just get through an area without losing so much sanitythe story while not ground breaking is pretty interesting
how they tie together  different character from different points in time to one flowing storyline is quite well done
the characters that you play as play very similar to each other except with some small variances like a heavy person running out of breath sooner than someone who is in better shape
again while this is neat after a while it seems like that all the characters are pretty much the same with no real advantages to anyone in particular
there are small differences but not enough to feel like you are playing as someone totally different and uniquethe graphics are very good
the character models are a bit clunky on some of the characters but most of them are at least adequate
they arent gong to amaze you like resident evil but they arent the worst either
the environments are where the graphical power of ed is shown
the backgrounds and environments are great to behold
to light reflecting in mirrors to mist rolling across the floor the environments are a sight to see
the only problem is you keep going over the same environments throughout the game
while you play with  different characters you are pretty much covering the same areas with most of them
there are some differences but a lot of it seems to be about in the same places
they are a few different main areas that the characters seem to cover
one may go to one of the main areas while another character may go to the other one
but thats one thing that could have been better to see different areas instead of just a fewoverall though i would say that ed is worth getting and adding to your gamecube collection
i wont say its the best game ever because its not but it is a very good game with some minor flaws but most games do have them right
i know i sound a bit critical of the game but i really did like it
i just didnt find it nearly as fun to play as the resident evil for the gamecube
and i dont see myself going through the game again anytime soon i didnt see any replay value therein a style more similar to onimusha than resident evil eternal darkness is one of the gamecubes most hyped game and one gamers have been waiting forever for
i bought the game recently and have been playing it almost nonstop
there are some pitfalls that gamers might encounter but overall it is a great game
here is the breakdownpros details
i read somewhere that it took over  years to make this game and you can see where the effort went
the various environments are very well detailed and the animation is as fluid as they come
the sound and music add to the ambient atmosphere
sometimes the music is as insane as the visuals
originality
the story line in eternal darkness is unlike anything i have ever seen
the idea being that you play several different characters in various points in history is something new to me and it gives a new spin on what would otherwise be a resident evil standard hack n slash
gameplay
whatever your skill with video games this will give you a good challenge
in ed you have not only to worry about you life meter but your sanity meter
throughout the game your sanity wains the more enemies you cross
this alters your perception
this is an innovative twist
the controls are responsive and easy to grasp the first time playing
a fair warning the action get pretty intense pretty fast so be ready
replay value
with  chapters spanning a good  hours there is a lot of reasons to go back
actions and choices you make early on change the direction of the game so you are guaranteed something different each timecons frustration
even seasoned resident evil fans might find the puzzled a bit frustrating at times
to be honest i didnt even get to the first chapter until i read through the guide
the clues are as cryptic as the puzzles sometimes so some parts might be unreasonably hard
much of the gameplay is trial and error so a guide is recommended
the healing items dont recover much on the life meter so sometimes recovering health is a tricky thing
this makes the game all the more hardas you guessed i really enjoyed this game despite some moments of frustration when i had to doubleback to find something i didnt get
will you like it
fans who like the ultraviolence of resident evil the puzzlesolving elements of silent hill and the real time combat of devil may cry will love this game
gamers who want something more straitforward probably will notlucky nintendo fans  first the remake of resident evil and now eternal darkness yet another horror game in which you are killing zombies in a mansion with limited ammo
the similarities stop there though as ed manages to blow the doors off of everything resident evil establishedthe plot is eds shinest feature  you literally watch a supernatural cult develop through  years of history
large lovecraftian creatures who think nothing of swallowing small planets like earth are battling each other across the universe and we just happen to be at the wrong place
youll explore a few special temples at various points in history as a roman legionare or gulfwar firefighter or franciscan monk or indiana jonestype archeologist etc
its fascinating to visit the same places  years later and watch how they change or how different people in history react to supernatural odditiesgamewise ed is pretty standard for survival horror  exploration puzzles and combat
the exploration is fun because of the above mentioned timetraveling element and the puzzles are rather easy with hardly a stumper in the enter game
combat is perhaps the best with the right combination of stratgey and action
monsters are pretty easy to pick off by themselves but it takes time and they often come at you in waves forcing you to think fast and direct your attacks effectively
magic is very fun in that you can explore and experiment learning new spells before the game is ready to give them to youthe much touted insanty effects are very interesting and certainly add to the spinecrawling horror of the game but i felt it was too easy to avoid them
i dont want to give everything away but as you encounter strange monsters your sanity level drops and eventually the walls start bleeding statues and paints turn their heads to look at you and even weirder things happen including effects that jump out at you the player and not just the charactergraphically i cant say ed is perfect
it can be pretty ugly at times especially the character models and the animation is kinda weirdall signs say this game doesnt play well a second time through  you know the story and the magic system completely
there is only  real secret in the game and  alternate ending
maybe it might be interesting to reexperience the very complicated plot a second time but certainly not a third
still i consider ed a worthy purchase my first for the gamecube in fact
buy itwhere to start oh yes the title
to put it bluntly its awful its almost laughout loud funny
any game that has a stupid artsy phrase like sanitys requiem in the title is going to be a bit full of itself
the developers needed to tone down some of the dialogue in this game
the chapter introductions left me wincing on more than one occasion with their extremely overthetop and frankly cliched speechs
but its only one part of this game moving on to the others
the graphics are deceptively beautiful theyre not going to make your jaw drop like resident evil but once you get into the world youll begin to respect them
the amount of genuine creepiness in this game dwarfs all of the pseudo scares in the wayward resident evil remake
the gameplay is also deceptively complex the wide variety of spells and weapons keep the game fresh and enthralling throughout
the targeting of limbs is rather gruesome but very effective resident evil needs to implement it now
the sound effects and music are some of the best ever going from very beautiful to very offputting in perfect transition is not easy to do but its done here flawlessly
the story is very unique and absolutely intriguing
it takes some real left turns now and then and thats the only way i like it
the game gets very very gruesome near the end and surprisingly disturbing
witness maximillians little rampage its just not pretty
the bonethiefs are somewhat a knockoff of body snatchers and that kind of thing but are no less scary
to point out another thing i love the basic names given to these enemies
i mean bonethief is just slightly off i dont know im probably overanalyzing
anyway this game leaves the best stuff for last so if youre like me and were thoroughly disgusted with the opening narration and somewhat overthetop theatrics of the first couple of chapters it only gets better much much better
and when youre done youll actually feel like youve been told a fantastic story and participated in it along the way
its nice to see nintendo showing some balls and actually producing a game as risky as this and putting it proudly along side its kiddie fare
buy buy buyat long last and with much fanfare the gamecube has entered the realm of eternal darkness
theres been much ado about the fact that nintendo was so involved with the development of this title in an apparent departure from its supposed kiddie mentality
the handson work was done by silicon knights blood omen on the psx
was the game worth the waitits hard to classify eternal darkness into any single genre which ends up being the games biggest flaw
ed doesnt have the dread factor of pure horror games like resident evil or silent hill simply because the enemies in the game are dispatched rather easily
the muchlauded insanity effects are certainly entertaining but they are very obvious for the most part when they occur which really detracts from the sense of involvement so vital to games of this type
all things considered ed has to be classified as an adventure game despite silicon knights and nintendos intention that it be a horror titlewith that in mind eds strengths are major  the audio and the story
the game uses dolby  to genius effect with wonderful sound effects and a brilliant score which changes to periodspecific styles fitting the timelinedriven story perfectly
the voiceacting is among the best ever recorded and supports one of the best plots ever conceived in a game
these two things alone propel ed to the top of this years releases for all systemshowever the gameplay itself isnt quite up to the quality of the audio
trying to target enemies in confined spaces can be frustrating and the frequent graphical clipping doesnt help
there is also no moveable ingame camera which would have been very helpful
some of the puzzles are also needlessly vague
on the other hand the magick system is superbly implemented
the sanity meter is a nice addition but the ps rpg shadow hearts sanity points system affects the gameplay much more directly
most of the signs of insanity in eternal darkness are window dressing albeit cool window dressing
 but little more
if eds insanity effects had been more subtle and more creative they would have been much more involvinged is a technical masterpiece that controls perfectly and sounds fantastic
its graphics show its n roots with the aforementioned clipping and blocky character models but are still supercool to look at
however it seems that ed suffers from overdevelopment and silicon knights probably had too much time and too much input from nintendo during the long development cycle
it appears that somewhere along the line sk lost focus
as a result ed is stuck somewhere between resident evil and soul reaver unsure of its own identity
is it a horror game
kinda
an action game
sorta
is it an adventure game with fastpaced combat restyle puzzles and backtracking a lovecraftinspired storyline and a few horrorbased gameplay elements
yeah thats about it
see what im getting at
innovation is certainly welcome but loses power when the game itself feels spread too thin
perhaps the developers suffered from their own loss of sanity
despite this eternal darkness is one of the strongest entries on the gamecube and is a powerful statement that the console is not just for kidsfans of survival horror games should be warned that ed might not live up to their expectations but anyone wanting a maturethemed wellwritten masterfully produced and involving adventure should take note  the darkness has comethis is a good game
i bought it and then i played it
fun was had by allevery body who owns a game console chose their console for a reason
usually there is a title that looks so enticing to the game player that heshe will plunk down a large chunk of money for a system just so they can play that one game
now if you own a gamecube mario is a likely candidtate for this sort of influence or pehaps the new metroid games one is for game boy advance that have me salivating now
well eternal darkness had this effect on me
i purchased this game because of the amazingly positive reviews i read
i watched the trailers on the intenet and it looked so awesome to me that i had to get a gamecube
well i played eternal darkness ed from here on out and it is a really good game
it is fun and there are a lot of innovative features to it
the sanity meter is genius
this concept will undoubtedly be used again although never to the same degree of surprise that this first game gave us
by the way
do yourself a favor and do not read what all of the insanity effects are before you play the game
it will ruin them for you
why four stars then you ask
well
for one the game was too hyped
it is not a genre beginning title what is anymore
it is not survival horror like the resident evil gamecube remake is
re is superb by the way  the game was pitched in such a way that led be to believe it was scary
it really wasnt for me
yes there are a lot of wonderful surprises with the sanityinsanity effects and all however it never acheives the level of creepiness that re carries all the way through it
it is really an adventure game
i love the dynamic camera
in re the camera angles are stills
eds camera angles are mobile and fully rendered in d
the magick is great
there are a few monotonous parts but in the end the game is very satisfying
this game is more of a d adventure than survival horror
yes is is bloody and greusome at times yet these aspects alone do not define the survival horror genre
keep these things in mind and you will no doubt love this game
it really is fun and unique just not the  stars i would have liked it to bedespite the stigma that the gamecube is just for kids a surprising number of highquality games have been released aimed at more mature audiences
the most original of these would have to be eternal darknesseternal darkness follows a young woman named alex roivas as she investigates her grandfathers murder
during her search through his mansion she comes across the tome of eternal darkness which gives the player control over nearly a dozen characters throughout historywhile the gameplay and controls are not as good as i would have liked the haunting atmosphere and the wild quotsanity meterquot effects are worth the purchase price
seeing flies on my computer screen or having the tv
randomly mute itself just added to the spooky atmosphere
considering that you can get this title for under  just about anywhere you should definitely add it to your gamecube libraryi have to say this is a very amusing game
it is cliche in some ways but certain aspects are so unique that they highly outweigh the typicality
the parts that are pretty frequent in games like these are the types of enemies very normal zombies the environments and the stories many might disagree with me on that third one thoughnow if you enjoy plots like this its sort of complicated you should read about it first you will love this game
personally they are not my favorite
they are relatively common for being a zombie gamehowever this is where i will say how outlandishly abnormal this game is
there is something that i have never encountered before and this is my favorite part of the gamethere is a sanity meter
it depletes over time and the lower it gets the more bizarre things that start to happen it is in some ways similar to an adult swim game called schizophrenzy
now this sounds much more bland than it actually is i can assure you
there are a lot of things that can happen because of this meter lowering to dangerous levels
but my absolute favorite one by far is when the tvs sound begins to lower and thats not allas it lowers the bar that shows up on the tv when it lowers like when you press the volume up or down on the tv the bar that appears showing how low or high it is
so when this happened it is actually one of the rarer ones to appear i frantically searched for the remote thinking one of my cats was sitting on it
i found the remote and i was in awe when i saw it was untouchedmy friend and i figured out eventually that it was because of the sanity meter
but for about an hour we were convinced that my house was haunted
it was terrifying living on the top of a woodsy hill in a secluded city at  in the morning
that sold me
but the other sanity meter results there are a lot of different ones are creepy and confusing as welli have told this to many many people
it was just that fantastic to methere are a lot of puzzles in this game and they are cool but most of them are a bit complicated to me
my friend was the one playing he had played this game thoroughly prior to this though so maybe if i were the one playing i wouldve figured them out from exploring moreanyway parts of the game namely the puzzles reminded me of a more complex tomb raider gamei would say if you like games like these this is definitely worth the time and money
but if youre like me then you might prefer to simply watch parts of it from online videos or friends playing the game because the sanity meter is without a shred of doubt the best facet of this gamevery interesting and imaginative game
the music is a big factor creating suspense
the puzzles are wonderful
variety of characters and settings adds a lot of variety
rating this game for mature players is appropriate
my only regret is the characters move like they have molasses on their feet
considering all the good points i can live with thateternal darkness sanitys requiem was a truly pivotal piece of gaming back in   the deep mythology the unnerving ambience the easytolearn gameplay the sanity effectsbut some years have passed
i have revisited the dark tale in order to once again discover its brilliance
but the simple truth is that eternal darkness sanitys requiem is a product of its time and was put on its pedestal way too sooni am not writing this review to simply analyze the videogames faults
frankly there are ton of star games available on amazon that are well worth your time and money in spite of their flaws
but with eternal darkness you must tread carefully
you are reading the reviews of memories not the review of the game as it is in i guess the best summary i can give you is that for every great idea in eternal darkness theres always some sort of caveat to remind you that youre holding a controller in your hand
so my personal review is going to be a this is good but kind of review
lets bulletpoint this one shall we
 the games combat is much simpler and easier than most survivalhorror games
you will often control a sword or other form of blade with the occasional pistol or projectile thrown in
frankly the guns are worthless
the game will quickly teach you how to take down your enemies
but better doesnt mean great
the combat leaves much to be desired
even with the magic system more on that later implemented in the later stages of the game you are still hacking and slashing some pretty boringlooking foes
 eternal darkness is famous for its sanity effects
whenever your character is spotted by the enemy you slowly lose your sanity which can eventually lead to some very frightening moments
ill leave those moments for you to discover which im sure are on youtube in case you wanna pass the game up
but other than eventually harming your health these sanity effects get old once youve seen them
the only way to really enjoy them is to deliberately delay killing your enemies
some may get a delightful cackle from going nuts but its not that genius when you think about it
 the game uses a magic system in order to not only enhance combat but to solve some nifty puzzles
as the game progresses you learn more spells and can make them more powerful
theres even a roshambo kinda system to the magic
but learning the spells is kinda cheap
in order to create spells you need runes
in order to use the runes you need to decode them
learning the spells requires little to no thought whatsoever because you learn them by just searching for different pieces throughout the stages
because you take little part in creating the spells learning them is tedious
 eternal darkness has a mythology and story that spans centuries
you will play as various characters whove encountered a supernatural evil leading to moments of sheer horror
but this method of storytelling means you only get a brief adventure with the characters
their histories their dreams their motivations their effects in timeyou will learn less than you hope
it becomes very apparent that main character alexandra roivas is merely someone who just finds their different stories in her family mansion
you want to know more about how her grandfather was mysteriously  gruesomely murdered
instead you begin reading the stories of others waiting a long time before alex is personally involved
 the game featured some great graphics for its time
the levels in particular look pretty sharp even today
i never understood the criticisms for resident evil graphical presentation because it immerses you in artistic creation
the environments except for the persian desert are uniformly strong
but the character models arent consistently good
some look amazing in closeup while people look blocky
some are very wellanimated in their movements while others move like constipated apes
even the corpses arent consistently drawn well
 sound plays a major role in this game and its the only nearperfect element in the game
the music is subtle and minimal
the screams are terrifying
the shocks are heartstopping
the voiceacting is excellent
the weapons sound good
the creatures are intimidating
whats most remarkable is the background  surround effects
early in the game youre in a monestary where if you approach an office you can hear a muttered secret meeting taking place
other than maybe the roivas mansions gonggong rhythm ive no complaints here
 the game has three different endings
but the differences are mostly cosmetic and minimal at best
finishing all three versions of the quest will unlock the ultimate ending for the game but the drive to complete the game three times is questionable
 eternal darkness has some good scares in it some of them boo moments others just disturbing
but while disturbing moments leave long impressions this game is only as scary as you want it to be
once you go through the jumpoutofyourseat moments youre not likely to be scared on your second playthrough
and going back to the sanity effects only you are in control of how mad your character gets
sadly there are only a few moments when the player doesnt control the sanitythose are the best surprisesi first played eternal darkness in july   i thought it was extraordinary
if i had done an official review i probably wouldve said  out of   to this day most critics reviews average out to that scorea few years later i popped the game back in
i finished the game but somewhat reluctantly so
i put the game aside and told myself maybe im just not in the right frame of mind to enjoy this fully
another time perhaps
after all some great games cant be played on a regular basis and need time to grow in your memories before you revisit themso now its   i have tried a third time to play eternal darkness from start to finish
about halfway through i have decided to stop
its just not that fun anymorethere is nothing shameful about a videogame that pioneered a genre years ago and has fallen by the wayside
our memories are real
we really did enjoy the worlds tales and experiences that eternal darkness gave us years ago
but its time to acknowledge that its core value as a videogame is diminishedif i may quickly sidestep one of my alltime favorite series is the metal gear solid franchise
those have much more emphasis on story  cinemas than they do on actual gameplay
but the differences is that those stories are brilliant a pleasure to revisit and the gameplay itself holds up in the time passed
eternal darkness on the other hand has a good story that isnt worth playing through
i loved the end but dont like getting there anymore
eternal darkness sanitys requiem belonged on its pedestal in its time to gracefully bring it down and not pretend that it still possesses the same magicthe good wonderful story one of the best magic systems ever made creative puzzles that arent too hard playing as  different characters keeps things constantly fresh fun combat nice graphicsthe bad because this game is so old the flaws really stick out very linear some puzzles just arent obvious enough even though combat is rewarding its very simple uneven difficulty short storythis game is really a buried treasure
it was an excellent and break through game back in its day and even today it can be a fun simple experience
controlling  different characters in the game one main character and  others it makes the whole game a fresh and remarkable experience
you are a character to finds her grandfather dead and must find out the secrets in his mansion
she comes across a book called the tome of darkness and as she reads it you play each character in the chapter and have to solve unique yet simple puzzles and fight many different zombies and baddies
whats different here though is that the combat is very simple yet is very customizable since you can lock on and delimb enemies and even cut off their heads
yes its very rewarding and neat to seeyou can pick up many different weapons throughout the game and you can even cast magic spells
i love the way this game does the magic since you have to find runes and them tomes to decrypt them and runes can be inside enemies that you have to defeat and you find tomes in many different ways
i also love how when the main character reads each chapter those spells you learned go to her and its amazing how each chapter coincides with the next and how it all ties together
i have never seen a game do something like this so well
the score isnt as great as it should be is because its  and you can see all the flaws in this game and its just too shallow compared to games we play now
even so its good for a quick you can beat it in about  hours and unique experience
the game does give you a few quick scares but is nothing close to scary or creepy really
if you have a wii or gamecube and are wanting something simple and easy to play pick this upi just beat this game and it was pretty fun
it took me  hours which is moderate
theres a little replay value because there are some variations of cutscenes and monsters depending on the ancient you choose as your enemy in the beginning
there are four ancients ulyaoth xellotath chatturgha and mantorok
each has its own personality
you cant choose mantorok because hes separate from the other three
hes the overseer
the other three have one ancient that theyre strong against and one that theyre weak against kinda like elements in pokemonyour spells are based on the three magic types  body mind and spirit
a blue spell will be stronger against a red enemy and weaker against a green one
monsters of different types will fight each other so its nice if you have two enemies kill each other
red is aligned with physical power blue with different realms and green with insanity
to create a spell you choose the type the desired affect and the subject
its a pretty interesting setup
theres some logic behind it not just random words
you can eventually tell what kind of spell an enemy is using against you and react accordingly
you have to unlock spells and you can get spells to do things like summon a monster to fight for you or create a shield
spells use up blue energy
theres also a meter for health red and sanity green
more on sanity laterthe combat is a little slow
if using a weapon the swing or rate of fire is usually slow because many weapons are old like singlefire pistols or a heavy medieval sword
you leave yourself pretty vulnerable
attacking is just hitting a to attack
you can target different body parts like chopping off a zombies arms to leave them completely defenseless
thats funto use a spell youll have to wait several seconds while the words are spoken
if youre interrupted the spell stops
so it can be difficult if youre low on life and youre trying to use a spell to heal but the enemy keeps hitting you
you can get stuck in a downward spiral until you die which can be frustratingif you keep dying you are forced to watch the cutscenes over in the first playthrough
that will get old fast and waste much of your time
after you play through once you can skip most cutscenes but that isnt much comfort if youre stuck on a boss the first time and he keeps killing youon to the story
the ancients are sealed away or something like that and one of them is trying to get free
its wreaking havoc and building its power and if it is freed it will be the end for humanity
but people throughout history are working to prevent that
you play as various characters from a page of the middle ages to a doctor in the colonial era
each of them are wiped out by the evil gods minions until only one person stands in their way  alex roivas
her grandfather was the latest in the fight against the darkness but he too gets killed
she must use the tome of eternal darkness read the stories of the people who came before her and collect the essences of the other three gods to stop the enemy ancientthe puzzles in eternal darkness are pretty light
things like match a certain object to the appropriate pedestal or use the correct spell on an obstacle
if youre looking for deep puzzles you wont find them herea cool thing about this game is the sanity meter
as it gets lower youll see sanity effects
at first its just a trickle of blood here and there on the walls
then the screen begins to tilt
eventually itll look like your tv or gamecube is doing strange things
your volume will go down or the game will tell you that your controller is unplugged when it clearly is not
youll try to cast a spell and your upper body will explode
then the character will snap out of the illusion
its pretty interesting and sometimes itll creep you out a little
once i was in the roivas mansion and my sanity was down about a third of the way
i went into the bathroom and checked the tub and saw my character in a bath of blood dead
there was a flash and a sudden scream
i jumped a little at that one
this game is definitely a bit scaryoverall this was a unique and enjoyable game
i recommend itat  am alexandra roivas a student receives a call telling that something bad happened with her grandfather in rhode island
she was his only living relative
she takes a plane to the island and she sees her grandfather is dead in a real pool of blood
his head has been taken but there were no hints about what could have done that
alexandra decides to stay in rhode island trying to find out what happened to her grandfather
but to do that she would have to fight against her sanity and fight against the darkness the eternal darkness graphics there are some good graphics in this game
you cant compare them with games such as resident evil for gamecube also
but theyre far from being bad graphics trust me fun its fun because your adventures happen since before christ until  you can use weapons of that particular time clothes from that time and there is a lot of violence in this game too
if you like cutting heads off with your sword or if you like to explode guts this game is for you
and its really frightening another fun thing is the sanity
when you see a monster or whatever your sanity drops and if you let your character with less sanity it will start to hear screams babies crying it will talk to itself it will see bugs in the camera blood in the walls and many other things
to recover your sanity you can use magick yes its magick not magic or explode monsters guts finishing it educative there are some educative things because you travel through different centuries with many characters so you and your kids if you let them can see what weapons were used in that time what clothes how were the constructions but there is also plenty of blood and violence durability it is wellkept if you keep it at the package dont worrynintendo has finally done a mature game with violence and blood
be careful with your characters sanity while playing the game and your ownit has been said that the difference between work and play is pointofview and nowhere in the computervideo game world is that better demonstrated than capitalism  graphs stock prices manufacturing concerns research and development is it an exciting game of running business empires or a dull training program for future suitsanswer that dependsi got this game when it first came out after playing capitalism plus for a while and really just couldnt get into it for many months
rather illogical i had played and enjoyed the first game quite a bit and capitalism ii is capitalism plus only more so
greater depth better graphics theres an almost pointless piece of praise and more more more
depth of playbut i just wasnt in the mood for a business sim
boredom can set in in any game if youre not in the mood for it but one feels especially absurd simulating work as recreation
so i backed off determined to come back later when the mood struck me to see if it was just me or if there was something in the game itself that made it less playable
im happy to report it was just me
if youre in the mood for a business sim this one can keep you happy for a long long time
at least as long as the mood lasts
let me reiterate this point however you have to enjoy this kind of game at the getgo
if you find business sims boring or too complex this isnt going to convert youcapitalism  allows you to make money through retail outlets manufacturing consumer products manufacturing industrial products raw material procurement mining crops livestock logging stock market shenaningans real estate and even a ceo salary you have an alter ego who can draw a salary and buy a mansion as well as running your business
you can specialize in a variety of retail areas footwear food computers leather or try to obtain de facto monopolies
you cant stop competitors from entering a field but you can make a product so superior that they are unable to sell their own products
you can also leverage the money from your monopoly to enter other fields and steal market share by dumping products
the former is a nice fantasy the latter of course is how one famous software company works
no business simulation is perfect nor even particularly realistic in the sense of an average consumer thinking yes this is the price that id pay for a product and this is how id buy it and capitalism ii has its own quirks
setting aside for a moment some essential game quirks like retail outlets offering a maximum of four products
for example most of my games turned into vertical conquests
if i want to dominate computers the goal of the first nontutorial scenario i would expect to be able to buy electrical components plastic steel and silicon so that i can focus my efforts on building a better cpu and later building better electrical components since that is the element with the broadest effect on my productsbut in the very first scenario where your big edge is a high level technology in palm computers youll find there is no silicon for sale nor even silica which you could at least use to make silicon
so i had to start by building a silica mine
in fact i may have even had to build an oil well to get plastics im not sure now
that seems like a bad way to start players outby the end of the game i had an iron mine and a coal mine to boot to build my own steel
really how many computer companies own their own iron steel silica and oil resources
i also owned quite a few retail stores and was selling most of my own productsthis game would probably be especially fun in multiplayer where you could pair up with people to focus on horizontal markets
in fact itd probably make a great and fun business class exercise with eightlpayer teams
im not keen on putting up companyspecific network code on my machine i dont do battlenet or gamespy for example and i dont think much of ubisoft in particular so i never bothered to try to find anyone to play online againstthere are two campaigns the first is a tutorial and its a campaign in the sense that each scenario builds on what you learned in the previous one the second isnt a campaign at all its just a bunch of unrelated scenarios which appear to be roughly in order of difficulty
and the first scenario of the nontutorial campaign is significantly harder than the last scenario of the tutorial campaign possibly leading to early frustrationallinall though this is a really good game
dizzying in its depth
substantial learning curve
as a business simgame i would give it five stars except for a few missing interface features theres no way to tell at a glance which resources you can buy
you can find out what your opponents are selling but the only way to find out whats available at seaports is to check them all out manually
 when hiring people to work for you theres no way to sort or filter those with a particular skill
you have to look through them all
 navigating through the multitude of screens is not as easy as it should be theres a back button which allows you to toggle between two screens but it really isnt adequate
also when you right click from some screens to go back to the main map the game seems to send you to a home position which has no relation to where you left the main mapthese and a few other similar interface issues may seem like minor annoyances but theyre barely enough to knock my score down to four stars
overall though a good experience for armchair mogulsi am not a game pro just an average player of games
i found that i get bored quick but so far this game has kept my attention
the game has a tutorial which is great but on the other hand i havent found a way to not play without the tutorial for the entrepreneurs campaign
the music get very annoying quickly that i had to turn it off to play
the graphic reminds me of sim type games and is very challenging
i do enjoy the custom game the best over the campaigns
when i get better i will play the campaigns
the book that comes with the game is great
it has all you need in it
i try to play without the book at first but found out that i had to read the whole book to understand the game better
all in all the game is fun
my husband and i fight over who going to get on the computer to play it and for how long
if my husband who is only interested in fighting and sports game enjoy this game then i am sure you willsome people just dont get it
there is nothing that will really get you to stand up and point this game out to anyone else
there is nothing here that you can do that would impress your friends or what notthink of the game as a school course or sim city will just the money and business parti find the game fun to play but i also love the idea behind business and creating oneif you dont know numbers if your looking to take over the quotworldquot or blow something up this is really the wrong game for younow if your looking for how to set up a business or how to run a corperation then i would say this is a rather good game to start withfrom building a farm to a factory
a retail store or a market you can get a good idea of how it is doneexpect to spend  hours just learning the game then you will enjoy itive always been a tom clancy game and i like the planning missions out beforehand approach
however it gets frustrating at times when u get shot in the head and thus taken out after just one shot
there were several times when i almost broke a controller playin this game
but overall it has solid graphics and its one of those that is frustrating but will keep u wanting to play more to overcome the challengesthis is a game for people with a lot of patience
no charging through levels and beating it the first time
more like attempting the same level a dozen times before getting it perfect for me anyway
and since your guys die from a single gunshot most of the time getting it perfect is pretty much required
you can make it through levels having lost some of the team members but since the guys aquire skills with each level passed letting them get killed off is out of the question for mewell 
i dont own this anymorea great game  but it and the rest of clanceys game ware out after time i play  the r games  and splinter cell  but even they get a bit boring  and well the graphics are a bit old but not badi how ever havent played vages or the newer gr games  yet  so ill review them  nextover all its a descent play be sure to check out ctgossamers  coming in   were ill review games for pc and ps and as soon as i get a ps or  
ill review games for those consoles as welldont get me wrong its an sweet game but the weapons selsction is very poor
you can unlock more weapons but it would have been better with them already unlocked the players
other than that is is almost the same as the other tom clancy gamesyup ghost recon requires every ounce of your patiencei kind of have a lovenhate relationship with this oneat times i used to get so flustered with this one that i used to bang doorsand sometimes i would be shouting with joywell the thing is have to know at what part of terrain u have to chose with ghost to be ur leaderand then to use the leader effectivelyyup these are the two thingsbut to realzie them u have to play a level multiple timesthis program really uses your computer up  so make sure you have a fast processor and adequate video and system memory before considering purchase
i have a ghz amd with a mb video card and ghost recon only runs in the lowest video settingsgameplay is really great
for those of you that played rouge spear everything will be very familiar to you in this game as far as controls and interface are concerned
the maps are pretty big and the enemies have really good ai programs
they are probably twice as smart as in rouge spearone thing i didnt like is the taking away of the detailed mission planning capabilities
in rouge spear you could plan it down to the smallest detail  orchestrating your forces
in ghost recon it is a much more simple interface  the planning can only be basicbuy this game if you have a fast computer and like a somewhat more intelligent shooter game than the average gore festsit is very hard but its fun to play
the graphics are good
good game for ages  and upthis game is amazing and probably is the best of  though i have yet to play return to castle wolfenstein
so why arent i giving it  stars
well unfortunately i still think that red storm has some glitches to clear up before this game is worthy of the full five stars
i have a good computer which ive tried to build specifically for gaming and first person shooters
i have all the requirements that should make this game run perfectly but i am still experiencing some lag
the game is so intense however that i am able to forget about the slight glitches except when they become so bad that i must restart the game
when the game is at its best its phenomenal
it is the closest thing to real combat that has been released thus far
ive played realistic games and games such as halflife where one shot doesnt kill and i appreciate both styles of firstperson shooter
if youre more preferential to the halflifestyle game where you can take a rocket to the chest and not die then dont buy this game because one shot almost always kills
the game rewards you for success by unlocking more specialists as you continue and awarding your outstanding performances with combat medals and ribbons
i thought that this was the most unique aspect of the game as well as the combat points that can enhance each of your characters
this game is awesome and truly amazing
it would be perfect if not for the abovementioned glitches
dont let that fool you though you need to experience this game to call yourself a fan of the firstperson shooter genre
it blows the rainbow six series out of the watertrust me this game is the best tactical shooter ever
not that i am a big fan of tactical shooters i think that alot could be done with all the tom clancey games
like more ingame scripted moments and the taking out the fact that every mission goes just the way it was planned
but with the absents of scripted moments you get to make your own which i have to say is incredibly fun
nothing is better than to infiltrate a base with a sniper get him in position on a high post
command a heavy assault guy to infiltrate the base and give him cover fire with your sniper while he runs to the target
or sending in alpha squadron to rescue pows but all except one of your guys dies and that guy is pinned down
so you call in bravo squadron to rescue that guy and he lives to see another day but he is wounded severly he got shot in the arm and the leg
i only gave it a  because the game isnt as hectic as that all the time some missions are not that great
the ending mission is just like all the others
the worse thing about this game is friendly ai the enemy ai is the best ive ever seen but the friendly ai is not that good
sometimes it is good but most of that time it isnt but that doesnt do as much damage as you might think
it is still a fun enjoying experience i recommend to anybody who likes this genrenote this review is based on the xbox version but i have not included any xboxspecific features
ghost recon is a welcome break from death match youmustbeonspeedtokeepup type games
instead of pulling a trigger and running around until you kill someone this game forces you to develop detailed strategies to accomplish your tasks
the action you do encounter and there is plenty is intensified by the fact the stakes are much higher  a couple of bullets or a wellplaced grenade takes you out of the game
this forces you to develop a properly planned and well executed course of actionthe game is squad based
during single player mode you play one of six soldiers and can switch between them at any time
your player leads one squad of three and you set a course of action for the other squad which is controlled by ai
as you complete missions and tasks you unlock addition items such as new soldiers to choose from
surviving missions also increases soldier skillghost recon has significant replay value
it has  levels and  different tasks to complete but because there are so many strategies that can be used to complete a level they can be played numerous times with the same enjoyment level
of course online play adds tremendous replay and excitementin my opinion the mark of a good game is how quickly time slips by while you are playing
time after time i have intended to wrap up in  minutes only to find that an hour has passed
this is a fantastic gamei do have a few complaints
the graphics are generally good but can be on the choppy side at times
i have also experienced instances where the ai squad didnt do what i had mapped out
but for the most part the game is a welcome addition to my game libraryas a flight sim i think il is superb
very realistic flight model excellent virtual cockpit great sounds
the only things lacking are the small nuances such as prop pitch settings or fuel mixture adjustment but few people use those anyway
as a game i would say its good
there are only a couple campaigns
the briefings are pretty dull and there is little sense of what is going on in the world or any connection between missions
but the graphics are just awesome better than any other flight sim by far
where else can you see individual soldiers jumping out of their lorry and running for their lives as you blast it to bits with your mm cannoni havent yet to really use this game to its fullest but what i have experienced tells me that this would be a great game to mastercomrades
after a glut of western europe wwii sims you now have the opportunity to fly over russia where mustangs and thunderbolts do not roam
instead in addition to planes like the me and fw you get to fly the stormavik  a sort of doitall heavy bomber strike fighter and if youre lucky and very good an interceptor
the stormavik is sort of like a tank with wings a wwii version of the a warthog
but youll also fly even more obscure planes  those you may have heard of i and even many you havent
and youll learn more about the differences between different versions of the same planes you mean the mee and meg dont fly and fight exactly the same
whod a thunk it
than youd imagine existed
ive already played janes wwii but il is far more immersive
some people hate the small hard to read gauges but readable instrumentation and a comprehensive and ergonomic panel was a dream to soviet fliers even years after the war
i thought the cockpit was conveniently claustrophobic and when lined up on the runway prior to a mision on a cold rainy day waiting to get the cue to start the engine i had the sensation of being trapped in a freezing car in december waiting for the radiator to get its act together
though packed with planes the complex flight characteristics make each plane the star why not just call it the lendlease p simulation
besides the convincing feel that youre inside of an airplane and you dont have to be a hero of the soviet union to know what it feels like to be inside of something other than your den the flight characteristics are uncharacteristically hardcore  just getting off the ground is a feat of aviation prowess equal to shooting down a dozen planes on the original cfsone word about dynamic campaigns  some criticized ils  lessthanentirely dynamic campaigns but when youre trying to be historically accurate youve got to portray certain historical events without regard to your ability to change history
a wwii pacific sim with a truly dynamic campaign would in theory allow you the chance to find and destroy ijn aircraft carriers on   thus obviating future battles in the coral sea and at midway
would that sim be more realistic because it was dynamic or less it monkeyed around with history
ubi soft chose the latter knowing that a truly realistic sim would require a fog of war and the element of surprise ie requiring the player to forget that on  an armada of enemy planes was about to strike pearlone word about systems  as much as the game tests your flying the software that it runs on will test your hardware
i originally ran this game on a windows xp p  ghz rig with  mb of ram and an s savage  card which is like buying a lexus with an track
video performance was abysmal  like watching a slide show and that was before takeoff
after personally conducting an investigation of the suspects for this criminal and counterrevolutionary deficiency and submitting my findings to the general commisariat of peoples simulations at the central presidium of aviation verisimilitude i have determined that the savage  video card was responsible for committing these crimes against the state of my pentium and have directed its removal and exile to the agp port on my  year olds celeron
after installing a geforce   mb ddr in its place performance improved markedly
in short comrades  to exploit this addition to your hard drive dont skimp on the hardware
instead lavish your machine with the highest grade of components and defray the costs by shifting assets from where they wont be missed  housing education agriculture infrastructure and environmental protection
long live the revolutionwhen i first heard about quotblack thornquot ill admit i was pretty excited especially after hearing so many good predictions
buying the game when it came out was on the top of my list and sure enough that is what i did
well now im sure you are just dying to know my opinion arent you
o ill begin with the negative points first off the single player missions are not incredibly challenging despite a few brain teasing moments
it took me less than a week to knock off all of its nine missions if i had more time to myself it might of been a lot shorter
also its thirty dollar price tag is a little steep even if it is a stand alone mission pack
on the plus side of things the nine missions this game provides are in some very impressive environments both size wise and graphical wise
not only that most of these missions prove themselves to have a high replayablity factor in both normal and special terrorist hunt lone wolf etc
modes
some new weapons have been introduced for all you single player lovers out there including the impressive mm ssg sr sniper rifle and the mm p smg sub machine gun which is a personal favorite of mine
multiplayer fans will love some of the new weapons that have been added just for them such as the mm m ar assault rifle and the impressive mm spp pistol
the storyline is not so bad itself either and was pretty well thought out but dont worry i wont give it away
so while this game is a little pricey any rainbow fan cant be without this overall impressive mission packi have this game and it is really cool
the graphics and sound effects are hotthis game is cool when u have friends over so u can race each other and try to blow up there bike
and yes there are weapons on the motor cycles so u can try to become the winner buy blowing up the other bikes
this game is intence 
you should really buy itthis game looks great on the outside but does it really look as good under the hood
well i think it does
the game combines adrenaline pumping speeds with the always popular vehicle shooting games
there are many characters to choose from each with a different kind of bike
the graphics are amazing
the background objects are well detailed and smooth
the tracks are brilliant
combining twists and turns into hills and jumps
the music in this game is great
it will feel like ur going down the highway with ur favorite tunes at  mph
so if you like racing games you should definitely purchase this game but like i always say if you are not sure rent itthis game is pretty good
its not as good as mario kart but its reeeaaalllyyy fast
if you enter the unlimited boost code which is lr z lr z at the title screen it goes blindingly fast
if you like racing games and you want a great sense of speed buy it
there are a few b parts of the game however
the races are over too fast and the sound is a bit muffled
on the other hand the tracks are beautiful and the game runs silky smoothdont get me wrong this is a great bmx game but it has several flaws that get annoying
first of all there is the quotfallingquot glitch
in certain areas you fall into nullspace if you fall and you go into this green vortex for several seconds
also the fakie mode is way to hard to manuevuer with and it gets stuck in the fakie mode
besides this it is a great game with the trick modifier system and the huge worlds
if acclaim had worked an extra month on this game it would be a gem dave mirra  boasts new characters more bikes vastly larger levels and of course greatly improved graphics
the trick system has been expanded with many new tricks and variations availablegraphically dave mirra  is not bad to look at but not really anything special either especially in comparison to thps
the d models are adequate and offer a good many lines to ride one and the textures are uniformly good
still the game is not nearly as graphically beautiful as some of the other firstgeneration games that are available on the new systemssound is good but again nothing special
the soundtrack is alright and even has its high points but its really a matter of personal taste
the usual grind noises thumps whacks and grunts of pain are satisfactory and vary enough to sound goodthe levels are large and often very creative but not as welldesigned as those in thps
they are fun to ride and contain the usual secrets huge jumps and multipurpose obstaclesthe game is much harder than its predecessor but still easier than thps
it should take a good while for most gamers to beat the game with every character and unlock all the secret videos riders and modes
there are rumors of secret levels too but i have yet to unlock any of themalthough most of the game seems pretty mediocre its still one of my favorite bikeskatetype games ever
why
well it all comes down to the trick system
dave mirra  offers an enormously deep and engrossing trick system that will keep a lot of us gamers busy for hours on end
and once you get used to the system you can start pulling all kinds of amazing combinations
and of course common stock tricks like superman seatgrabs and double nacnacs become quite easy to pullsimilar to thpss manuals mirra  riders can tie their tricks together with heelies and nose wheelies and flatlanders can even pull endoes and stoppies if they know what theyre doing
a wide range of grinds and plants are available tooin the end this game will not impress anyone with its mediocre graphics and just decent level designs
what will keep people coming back to this game is its brilliant trick system and the enormous versatility
i still havent gotten tired of it
if you like bike games and especially if you bike in real life like i do  you will find this to be the best and most enjoyable bike game available
its easy to start playing even for beginners but offers enough depth to keep even hardcore gamers coming back for morethis game is relly good the graphics are great and its not hard you will find ur self playing for hours everyone who gave this game a bad review is gay and does not really like videogames so dont worry this game is awsomeits just like all the other games
i mean dont get me wrong all of them are fun too but this ones just a little more boring than tony hawk and aggressive inlinecrazy taxi is a whole lot of fun and if you never bought a dreamcastas many of us didnt including methis is your chance to own the best arcade racer in years with slightly improved graphics
what i like best about it is that its oldschool arcadestyle play theres no end and no goal except to rack up the highest score the most money that you possibly can
if youre a fan of wild arcadestyle racing dont hesitate to buy this gamefor the people who didnt get it for the sega dreamcast can now get their hands on it
its true that it is only a remake of an old classic and there isnt anything new but if you never played it like me its a wonderful game
the point of the game is picking up passengers and taking them where they want to go
as for your cabbies you get  fearless drivers to choose from
axela slick young driver whose ready for anything
bd
joea fast party loving hip hop driver
genaa hot cool girl who loves the open road
gusa old yet ready to go driver with keen looks and attitude
as for the cities you drive through they present huge challenges and many people to pick up
the cities are like los angelos and san franciso complete with beachsmallsheavy traffic and even cable cars litter the streets making your job harder as you drive through the crowed city
your passengers that you pick up will want to go anywhere from kentucky fried chicken to the city bank and the passengers have attitudes of their own too
but aside from the to huge cities and its residents the point of the game is collect as many fares as you can and get your passengers to their destionation points as soon as possible
dont worry
no cops will be on your tail so ram into cars and drive wherever you want so you can give your passenger a good time while collecting tips for the craziest stunts you can perform on your way to their dropoff point
its easy to learn and easy to master
no brains needed
crazy taxi may be old but its still alot of funthis was a really fun game on the dreamcast back when it came out and its gonna be pretty much the exact same thing on gamecube with graphics just a little bit better
but if you already have it on dreamcast there is no reason to spend  bucks on a game you already have
if you have not played it i suggest getting it because its pretty fun especially if you have friends over and you can see who gets more moneya little about the game itself the game is based on driving a taxi around a city there are two huge san francisco type cities to choose from and go around getting customers for your taxi
choose from  drivers each with their own car things that theyll say like quothop inquot or quothey whats upquotonce you get your customer theyll tell you where they wanna go and then there will be a little arrow telling you directions
get them to their destination within a certain time and you will get paid an extra tip and if you dont make it in time or have a slow time you wont get quite as much money
youll do that for a preset time  minutes  minutes etc or you can play arcade mode where you get more time when you get more customersthe gameplay in this game is what makes it great the controls are just awesome
driving around is easy to learn yet challenging to master because there are special moves that you learn like the crazy spin i believe its called where you can turn really fast and easycrazy taxi is about picking up people taking them to the destination they want to go and collecting the fee
however the best part about all this is the fact that to do that you have to break every traffic law ever made
theres not much more to talk about except for the fact that as many people have pointed out that this game is the same thing as what youd buy on dreamcast and playstation  and xbox for that matter
which means if you have the dc vertion there is no reason to get this game controll is the same surprisingly enough
save your fifty for super monkey ball or somethingsince sega stopped developing video game systems awhile ago largely because of the dramatic failures of dreamcast and saturn they just knew they couldnt try to make anymore at this point
it seemed to be a little bit sad but does seem to work itself up all over again
that was the absolute case for crazy taxi
the game is a wild and wacky strategy racing game as you try to beat the clock to try to drop your passengers off
the game does seem to hit it off but the music does seem to drown out the fun a little bit with a sagging dash of hard rock in the mix
the game does feature a down side with only a couple of courses but makes up for it in the fun
the game proved itself in the arcades but there has to be a sequel in the works
they made ones for the other systems and they might have to make one here in the future
crazy taxi is a wicked ride for the gamecubethat seems a little strange to me dont you think
when you bump into stuff the controller rumbles
thats cool
you can choose to be on there for a certain amount of time that you cam only pick
overall this is a neat game
it has music by the offspring toothis game was fun for the first couple of times that i played it after that it got to easy
its still a good game andi still have fun playing it and i reccomend it to anyone who can get it who has a sony playstation a nintendo gamecube or a sega dreamcasti dont like star wars at all but i have this game and it is ok not great but ok i think it is realy hard to pass the levels it isnt as realistic a combat flight simulator  for the pc made years ago
so if you are desprate or are a star wars game look into this gamethis is one of the few star wars games that is fun to play
the graphics are quite advanced for the gamecube and it plays well on the wii
i cant wait for a night open to sit and run through a few more levelsrogue leader is a truly great sequel to the original rogue squadron on n
while the original was limited mostly to battles over the surfaces of planets this new version features open battles in deep space
from mammoth star destroyers that you can actually attack to atats you can bring down by wrapping your tow cable around their legs to a level you can play as darth vader himself this game totally immerses you in the feel of the moviesthe graphics like most gamecube games are stunning but you really have to see this game in action to appreciate just how much it looks like the movies
your xwings lasers reflect off the walls of the death stars trenchestie fighters spin out of control and crash after you hit them
and lucasarts filled the whole game disc with voices straight from the movies and music straight from john williams orchestraif you are a star wars fan you must own this game
it puts starfighter and other recent entries in the franchise to shamerouge leader does a better job in the star wars video game collection as an xwing shoot um up than the origonal rouge squad
but it would nice if lucasarts didnt put the multi player in  a bounus disk in the rd game that has rouge leaders multiplayer in ityou are luke skywalker the leader of the elite flying force called rouge suaderan
you do missions with only two of the dozen wingmen as you drive your star fighter through historical and notashistoricalasthehistoricalmissionsthis is a great game but you wont be hooked for hours upon endif you want something really intresting go to and find the cheat sheet for rouge leaderits just to hard for me im sorry i sound like a woos i know but its just redicolusly hard
it has great graphic though and somewhat fun gameplay
but i dont like it that muchother than that its a great game for star wars fansthis video game is an amazing recreation of the first  star wars films
the graphics are unbelievable they match the films so closely
star wars fans will be treated to the attacks on both death stars the battle of hoth asteriod fields cloud city an assault on a star destroyer tatooine darth vaders tie fighter advance and the falcon
at times there can be hundreds or thousands of objects on the screen each in high detail
remember the trench run
its in there
remember the  tie fighters swarming the falcon at the end of jedi
its in there
if it had anything to do with space ships and it appeared in the first  star wars films its in this gamehowever rogue leader as a game reminds me why some movies dont make good video games
rogue leader is basically a space fighter game which means that you fly in circles around targets hoping and praying for those brief moments when your sites line up
this game just doesnt play with the same thrill as the space scenes of the movies and i found that id rather just watch the films again than endure the frustrationplus as great as the graphics are you have to practically crash your ship to see them
for example the battle of hoth had thousands of stormtroopers swarming under the feet of at least  atats and atsts in one valley but even on my  tv the troopers are no more than dots until you literally crash into them
a huge effort wastedfinally the total gametime is no more than  hours in length
i finished most of rogue leader in  days
there were a few secret missions and ships left to unlock but i had no desire to do so
rent this game see if its worth your moneylet me just start off by saying that prisoners of maw is hard as hl and i couldnt be happier
i remember wizzing through the original rogue squadron and then after finishing it saying quotthats itquot it was way too easyshort
if it had been longer harder or both it would have been much betterbut enough of that this isnt a rouge squadron review its a rouge squadron  review
and rouge leader is exactly what i wish the old game had been
the controll play is excellent its much harder than the old one the graphics are stunning and its a much better developed plot the original seemed to go nowhere fast with each level having almost nothing to do with the prevoius onein short great game for a fantastic system buy it youll be glad you diddid you like the original star wars atari arcade circa  if so youre going to love this
the first mission you play is loosely based off the original blow up the death star vector based arcade but as the rogue leader aka luke skywalker in this scenario you can also issue orders to your two wingmen
the graphics and sound are top notch incredible is another word that comes to mind and really pull you in into the game
control is tight and is easy to work with
in fact i would say this the one of the best arcade style flight combat game engines to date
after the first mission you have ten additional campangs to play out scenes from all three classic trilogy films are represented the atat battle on holth cloud city battle of endore and of course the final battle to destroy the second death star
there are a lot of hidden goodies if you check the official rogue squardron ii website youll be able to obtain codes to unlock bonus levels including ones that let you play on the side of the empire what more could you ask for
with so many star wars titles now available on gamecube you may think of picking up some ot the newer titles first my advise is to start with this one you wont be let downok i am probably the biggest nerd in the universe i own all three console systems in addition to my pc
you might say i like games a lot
maybe too much
it seems like i waste a lot of money on mediocre games that make me wonder why i even botherthen i buy a game like rogue leader and i remembernext to halo rogue leader is probably the greatest console game on the market and possibly one of the best ever made
the graphics are pristine the gameplay is excellent and it captures the star wars atmosphere perfectly
while i wasnt a big fan of the first rogue squadron because it sometimes degenerated into arcadelike silliness the sequel seems to have the best elements of an arcade style shooter combined with some of the features of the xwing games for the pc
the result is an immersive compelling game with lots of twists and turnsits not all flowers and sunshine unfortunately and there are a couple of small missteps that keep me from giving this game that fifth star it deserves on the single player missions alone
the biggest flaw and one that is slowly becoming the death of more and more games out there is the lack of a multiplayer element
obviously this limits replayability but what really bothers me is the fact that this could have been the halo of the gamecube
unfortunately without utilising those three other joystick inputs rogue leader doesnt live up to its full potentialrogue leader could have had better music at times as well
it seems to rely on miditype music that makes john williams incredible score sound thin and computerised
the only other flaw a small one is that i think the game could have used some additional point of views and customizeable controls
people used to the xwing games on the pc might have an easier time mastering the gamei know this soudns like a lot of complaints but considering the strengths theyre really small potatos
the missions dogfights maps backgrounds and all the visual elements are almost flawless
there are lots of unlockable missions like navigating the millenium falcon through the asteroid field that will compell you to play a mission over and over to get them right
the gameplay is far more challenging than your usual batch of arcade shooters and the variety of vehicles keeps them from getting tedius
if youre a star wars fan youll probably be hooked the first time you fly along the surface of the death star or take out an atat with your towcables
this game really shows what the gamecube can do and what it can do is surprisingly impressiveone of the best games out there for nintendo gamecube this game has amazing graphics
it is a great improvement on quotstar wars rouge squadronquot however it is very difficult
try it out for a challenge
there is not much else to say for it except that every star wars fan needs itsubtitled rogue squadron ii this gamecube game lets you fly spaceship in the star wars universe and take on the original star wars universeive always been a huge fan of space combat games from the other star wars games to the wing commander games
the graphics were very nice but not hugely better than those other games
the flying and ships are in the same arenathe gameplay itself is pretty straightforward
eleven missions each with its own objectives
theyre not always clear about where to go next or what to do
if you die youre sent back to the beginning of a section to start again
if you happen to catch on this means you can win the entire game in a few hours
if you happen to get stuck on a given area you could be replaying the exact same scene over and over againdefinitely a musthave for any true star wars fan to relive the fun of that first movie
and spaceflight fans like me will enjoy it for its nice graphics
but others might want to rent it a few times from the local store to make sure its what they enjoy before buying itim not a big fan of all the star wars universe but i always enjoyed the flight simulator games
controls are very easy to learn and there is a training stage to help you understand and control everything
the sound is great as with all star wars gamesyou get to fly through various worlds and battles from star warsbut there are some things that are sort of bad with this game
it may just be my deep personal opinion but it seems like youre always out there alone
constantly you hear your teamates crying for help while youre being tailed by tie fighters tearing you a new one
it can get annoying that you have to help everyone on the rebel team but no one can ever get the stealth tie fighters off your rear
oh wellits still fun
of course there are secretswhat game would be complete without secrets
none i tell you
you have to complete the mission in a certain amount of time and within certain parameters of performance
based on this you win a medal
medals equals points which you can later use to buy bounus stages
and i will flat out tell you that the final stage is the most intense and killer battle ive ever played
you dont have to be a star wars fan to follow this gameif you just like to fly around and shoot enemies out of the sky then you too can play this game and enjoy it
one of the cooler things about this game is that you as the title suggests are the rogue leader and can control what you want the rest of the squadron fighters to do throughout the mission
whether it be attacking the oncoming tie fighters or taking out large turret guns firing from bases below youre in control a definite plus
the number of ships and features you get to use through out the game make it even more exciting
this game is definitely worth checking outi cant find anything that stands out as being bad about rogue squadron which was one of the first titles released on the nintendo gamecube
it has many good things going for it not the least of which is its star wars license which is put to excellent use
from the menus which feature video from the classic trilogy to the sound effects ripped straight from the films to the plot which starts at the end of star wars and goes through to the end of return of the jedi its all therethe games easy to pick up and a lot of fun
the missions arent incredibly difficult to get through though earning gold medals on all of them is next to impossible at least before youve found all the hidden powerups and unlocked some of the extra ships
some of the requirements are a little too stringent if you ask me  why include the targeting computer and a powerup that lets you keep it on all the time if youre not supposed to use it
also to kill enough enemies to earn a gold medal on most missions you have to get rid of your wingmen which removes the whole appeal of having wingmen in the first place
there are also levels where its too easy to lose or miss a medal because you made a simple mistake
when a mission takes  minutes to complete that gets real annoying real fastin any case i cant say this is a bad game it just didnt jump out at me as one of my favorites
the lack of a multiplayer mode being remedied in its upcoming sequel which is supposed to have cooperative multiplayer might be part of it
it could also benefit from more of an overarching storyline like in the xwing games on the pc  each mission feels disconnected from the others
part of the problem is also that i had the first rogue squadron on the n and this feels like mostly the same game with better graphics
im holding out hope that rogue squadron iii will improve on all these areasa solid game and at the prices you can get it for now id recommend it to any star wars fan
otherwise rent it first before you plunk your cash downi pretty much bought the gamecube for this game and resident evil
while the graphics and sound are typically great the controls were frustrating
i much prefer the gameplay of the starfighter games to the one exhibited in rogue squadron
was also enlessly annoying to have to use the targeting computer to see targets as the lighting made it otherwise too difficult for me
perhaps it was just a problem with my tv but it only happened for this gamethis game is a must for any quotstar warsquot fan
the game play is awsome graphics nice
great ship selection if you can unlock them or just get the passcodesmikepros
real starwars levels like the attack on the deathstar and the battle of hoth
wedge antallies real voice
cool star wars aircrafts like the xwing and the millennium falconcons
it is impossible to unlock everything whitout cheats
levels are to long
chewbacca is not plyable
the n game is betteri can still remember the shrieks of rage that erupted from my brother when biggs got shot down in the first assault on the death star
his emotion seemed a little excessive but then again he always took his star wars pretty seriously
his rage must have left an impression however because i bought rogue leader thinking i could rewrite star wars history and save biggs
while im happy to report that the game is great fun and faithfully recreates many of the enormous space battles of the first three movies i could not save biggs
he was as i always feared merely an extraand doomed to be cannon fodderi didnt find the tutorial mission to be much help though you do get to bulls eye womp rats it was more exploration than instruction
youre probably better off just jumping into the first mission that pits you luke skywalker piloting your trusty xwing as red five against the original death starit looks right out of the movie and really sets the mood for the game
the first two parts of this first mission are basically tutorial as you attack cannon towers and hapless tie fighters that rarely shoot back or do much in the way of evading
youre able to give your wingmen commands to do a number of things and theyre pretty effective at carrying out orders
the only difficulty in the mission comes when darth vader appears with a guard of tie interceptors wounds wedge and then blows biggs awaysniffle
you must as obiwans spirit guidesuse the force luke to finish off the death star
you all know the resteach mission gives you three lives to complete the threepart missions
after each successfully completed mission statistics are compiled and medals are awarded or not awarded according to your proficiency
each medal is worth points and can be used to unlock alternate fighters and missions
each mission also has upgrades hidden somewhere in the map which can be used to upgrade ships components
it is worth noting that the missions jump rather radically in difficulty so that by the third mission youre up against a star destroyer and cursing blasted wedge for not backing you up
if you could clone porkins im sure hed die in every missionthe mission difficulty is probably the most frustrating aspect of the game but also the most rewarding
one minute youll be cursing the game and its makers and trying to restrain yourself from smashing the controller and then suddenly realize some new tactical strategy that lets you finish the mission
i will say that the final mission is simply too difficultrealistic but too difficult
i beat it after much pain and cursingthe technical aspects of the game are very well done
the controls are responsive and every craft feels very different to pilot
there are also several views inside cockpit just behind fighter far back of fighter and bombing view for those fighters that are capable and each viewpoint has advantages and disadvantages
the graphics are some of best to be seen on the cube to dateup there with resident evil and the like
the missions that recreate battles from the movies look exactly like their movie counterparts
i also didnt encounter any glitches or bugs while playing this gamethe audio is terrific and appropriate for a star wars game
the staple soundtrack and sound effects are right out of the movies
the voice acting was the most surprising as any spoken dialogue not taken directly from the movies is voiced by actors who do a convincing job of imitating the stars
the replacement voice for lando billy dee williams was especially convincingin all rogue squadron ii faithfully recreates the major battles of the star wars movies in all their difficulty and technical brilliancejust be prepared to see biggs dieagainfirst off im a big fan of the original star wars movies i loved them
but the game disappointed me in several key aspects
and while i may not have enjoyed this title as much as others it was still a nice game to experiencethe graphics were excellent the music true to the movies and the game was incredibly easy to control
so what made it take a turn for the worse
the basic gameplay
it seemed like every mission i started i would end up attacking the ship i was supposed to be escorting or spending half an hour trying to fire my secondary weapon i still dont know how to fire a tow cable
the problem is that the only instructions you get come in verbal form that would seem to only serve as a reminder to those who already know what to do
i really came close to throwing my controller out the window several timesonce you realize what the objective actually means for me that meant looking at an online guide you can appreciate the game for what it is
i may not have played many flying games but the ships all seemed easy to control
i ended up enjoying the levels where you could just fly around attacking ties for target practice
since a large part of the game consists of collecting medals for achieving objectives it should last you a respectable amount of time assuming you eventually understand the instructions
there are also many unlockable levels so it felt like you got a lot of variety complete with visually amazing and unique sceneryoverall a great flying game but maybe not quite worth a purchase
great for a weekend rental but unless you are a hardcore star wars fan i wouldnt recommend buying itwhat can be said about star wars rogue leader rogue squadron ii
everything about it the graphics sound controls story and even voices are good
from the moment the gamecube intro movie passes you are entertained
even before you have to pick up the controller you see stormtroopers forming in the lucasarts logo dancing to the mos eisley cantina music
from then on it is sheer bliss
the controls take a little while to get used to but after that brief learning period they are second nature
your thumbs and index fingers flow perfectly to the correct buttons and never once do you need to check where they are
the movies of this game just dont do the sound and picture justice you wont even notice that you arent playing the movie most of the time
the voiceovers are well done and placed factor  the developers even got the real voice of wedge antilles to do his voice
the only reason why i give this game four stars is because of the difficulty level
you can be stuck on a level for days at a time and then you can forget about a gold medal until you replay it with about a thousand more times and thats with all the upgrades you can find
the lack of a multiplayer option is a minimal inconvenience as it would detract from the experience in the rest of the game
many people would end their review with quotmay the force be with youquot but thats just to cheesy for me
ill just go with the simple quotgood luck and good huntingquotthis game is awesomeuntil mission   i dont mind a challenge but a game ceases to be fun when you play the same mission fifty times and beat it finally out of sheer luck
the last mission is too hard period
if you have anything resembling a life outside of your gamecube you will never earn gold medals so forget about it
i find this to be true with many of the gamecubes gamesand people say this is a machine for kids
graphically and soundwise this game is amazingbest i have seen on a console to date
the games early levels are awesomeyou feel like you are in the movie and the challenge is perfect in many of the later levels
be warnedyou run the risk of destroying your gamecube when you try to fly out of the exploding death star in level  for the umpteenth time only to crash into a wall as you try to speed away from the fire
it is damn near impossible
factor  would have had a near perfect game if not for that flawthis is a great game
graphics and sound are great
why i gave it four stars is because some parts of the game are really tough specifically the battle of endor level you try blowing up three star destroyers with an awing and the last level
overall a great gamethis game is fun
it has nice graphics and good gameplay
however it is a duplicate of marble madnessthe actual game is fairly good
the multiplayer are a mixed bag
the bowling is just about the worst thing ive ever seen
it got my neighbors little girl so upset we had to make her promise not to attempt itthe golf on the other hand is amazingly good
as good as mariothis game does a great job at rounding out the gamecubes lineup
with minigames galour this unique game never fails to impress with its innovative level designs and cool shortcuts
the main game is impressive over  levels and thats not even counting the bonus levels
also there are a few things to unlock so the main game always keeps you coming back for more while you earn play points
the main game however is unimpressive compared to the great variety of multiplayer minigames
monkey bowling monkey target monkey billiards monkey golf minigolf monkey race and monkey fight are all fun to at least some degree and they are all multiplayer
monkey bowling is always fun because its easy to get into even for beginners
monkey golf is frustrating at first but once you get the hang of it it is quite enjoyable
monkey target is also really great and monkey fight is perfect for partiesthe game does have a few shortcomings
the music is not catchy and the controls seem a bit sensitive at times
also some of the levels on expert mode are just too difficult to the point that they are intensely frustrating
however monkey ball comes out on top because of its innovative play and excellent minigamesthe second game is much better and has better games but this is still a fun party game if you dont have the second onethank goodness the nintendo gamecube is a high quaility console
cuz as many hours as my roommate and i have played quotsuper monkey ballquot youd think a system would over heat
thank you nintendo for such wonderful games
the replay value for this game is up there
gt even after you beat it its still fun to play again amp again
did i say bravo nintendoi was afraid when i first got this game that its replay value would not last
it was one of the first games for the gamecube and that had me worried
plus cmon
it was a monkey in a ball
but when i played it i was pleasantly surprised
the main one player game is pretty difficult the expert mode close to impossible sometimes
but it is still fun to try
but my favorite part is the variety of multiplayer games it offers to unlock
my family plays the monkey race and monkey fight all the time
i also like playing the billiards tournament against the computer sadly admitting that i dont always win
when i am tired of grinding through some of my other games i put in super monkey ball and let the extra games take over
without the extra games this would just be a brief rental
but the simple fun of bowling hanggliding and smashing your friends off of the screen with a large springloaded boxing glove keeps me coming back for moreas a kid i played super monkey ball  in which the main antagonist always spoke of revenge
i got the st on years later and it plays just the same
you control a monkey in a ball with the control stick and attempt to break the ribbon between to goal posts within  seconds  for some levels
i was disappointed by the lack of story
i will never know why dr badboon wanted revenge
oh well its still a good gamethe main game consists of d platforming quite literally as you have to navigate d platforms suspended in air while trying not to fall off
the party games are pretty simple
there is racing billiards flight and others
they have slightly different play controls and are really fun to play with friendsi bought the gc as a family machine so this game was a natural choice
i was surprised how much fun my wife and i had with it if we both like a game it must be well rounded
the mazes are very addictive
with the many games included there is something for everyone
i cant wait until my kids are old enough to play this onethe nintendo gamecube as a system is better than ps and can almost match xbox but the games may be limited unless you have a good open mind
many people say quotthe games are too childishquot sure i can understand that
but that doesnt mean even game is kiddy junk like super monkey ball
just check out metroid prime rogue squadron ii and rebel strike super smash brothers melee and enternal darkness all great games
sure some games may be the cheesiest things ever but most of the gcns games are classics
note lay off zelda wind waker that is a very good game being turned into a kiddie gamenot a good choice to buy iti bought the nintendo gamecube console because of the previous console nintendo the playstation and the xbox are good consoles but i had to go with the gamecube
it would be pretty difficult to live up to the nintendo  but the gamecube did a good jobwell right off the bat the console is smaller and takes up less room and instead of a cartridge the gamecube uses a disc
there smaller than dvds i guess i am a gamer of the past but i like using cartridges better i feel like they are more durable than discs
also there are two memory card slots and four controller slots all built in to the consolemoving on to controllers they mastered two things the joystick and the rumble pack
the joystick for the nintendo  wear out easily and theyre rough on the hands they gave me blisters now theyre much easier to use and they dont wear out as easily
also instead of a bulky rumble pack to go on to the controller now its built into it making it lighter
i loved the nintendo  controller for its unique design and i was a little disappointed that the gamecubes design is more like a regular controller but over all they did a good jobnintendo s memory could be great than terrible
some games didnt need memory cards because they had built in memory and then sometimes one game could take up a whole memory card
the gamecube made this simple
there are three memory cards sizes  blocks  blocks and  blocks
each game takes up a certain amount of blocks for example super mario sunshine only takes up  blocks and thats a pretty big game
so you get a lot of room on one memory card which means you will be spending a lot less money on memory cardsmost importantly the games there are  games on the gamecube so there are plenty to choose from and most of them are family friendly games
the playstation  and xbox may have more games but most of them are not all that great
gamecube has a lot of great franchises and tons of the same games the playstation  and xbox have anywaysheres my take on gamecubes graphics
the bars have been raised and the gamecubes graphics have definitely improved
improved d backgrounds and smoother characters make it a good console to getone more thing this is a pretty cheap console and most familys can afford it and you get so many fun games so its worth the price
i love nintendo and the nintendo gamecube does not disappoint so why not pick one upthe gamecube may seem like a little kids console at first but after checking out the selection of games and by playing a few myself i have realized that it is notthe graphics are nice on every game ive seen so far
they rival the ps though im afraid i cant say anything on the xbox as i dont own it
gameplay is very smooth
there are no ridiculous delays or long load times
the controller is also quite comfortable though the analogs are very sensitive
the gamecube also has a handle and is small perfect for vacations
the gamecube also has a variety of games from super smash bros to zelda to lost kingdoms
this definitely isnt just for little kids i know that little kids normally dont play resident evil
it doesnt have as much variety as the ps but there is still a good enough variety to make it worth buyingsadly you cant convert games from previous nintendos into this one as usual
i also havent found a use for all four control slots perhaps it is for games i have no interest in
still the gamecube is a nice console that so fars seems very nice in many areasplease know that i love nintendo and have owned all of their major systems
gamecube was the first of this generation of systems that i bought i now own a ps and an xbox
i love nintendo games so i am happy with it
if i had to choose only one system this would not be itpros nintendos own games eg
legend of zelda super smash bros melee metroid paper mario are some of the best in the industry
 the graphics and audio power of this unit are amazing
 the system is very portable complete with a handle for carrying
 the controller is very ergonomic and easy to usecons many major titles have not been brought to gamecube even if they are on xbox and ps
 the system requires that you purchase memory cards and a hard drive is not available
 online gaming is not available i think there might be one game and is not encouraged by nintendoi own an xbox and have owned every system since atari and this is certainly one of the best
for anybody who already has a dvd player this is the system for you
it is compact and has great graphic capabilities
my xbox is in the garage now due to the fact this one fits better and i have a dvd player on my home theater system
the only system with resident evil zero and re is coming out
also with games like mario cart double dash and star wars rogue leader  exclusively coming out on the cubenow is the time to buy it at a great low pricei totally love the gamecube
the graphics are great the games are cheap compared to the psxbox counterparts
but i am quite annoyed that all the games are kids games
there are no gtas or manhunts or adult games at all for this console
and i hate the noise the fan makes
nintendo could have designed it to shut up
if you turn it on its side the noise goes away
but make sure it sits on something to make room for the fan to breathepeople moan because it wont play dvds or cds
but the disc are minidiscs to crack down on piracy and bootlegging
its a helluva lot harder to copy a minidisc to another minidisc
it also makes the console fully devoted to playing games
it is called the gamecube after allnintendo had a lot riding on their follow up to the n
the cartridgebased system had not done well on the market and they had been severely overshadowed by the sony playstation
thankfully nintendo has ditched the cartridges and made developing for their system more quotprogrammerfriendlyquot
as a result the gamecube is a vastly better thought flawed systemthe good news is if you get this system there will be a number of highquality titles you can only get on the gamecube
metroid prime the legend of zelda the windwaker and eternal darkness are just a few examples of the quality and unprecedented variety of nintendos titles
there are two drawbacks however that will be holding nintendo back in the current console race
first the lack of rpgs
most gamers remember the days when you could play the latest final fantasy or dragon warrior game only on nintendo
sadly this is no longer the case
there are currently only a handful of rpg titles for the gamecube
second the lack of a stable online environment for play
while the gamecube is expandable and can have dialup and broadband adapters added it lacks a community to rival xbox live which alienates avid sports and action gamers who want to compete onlineall in all if you like the single player experience the gamecube is the superior choice
if you are a hardcore rpg gamer or online gamer you may want to look elsewherelike a lot of others i grew up with nintendo
zelda metroid super mario bros etc were all household words when i was a kid
i stayed with them faithfully with each new system including all the gameboy units
a few years back i picked up a sony ps and ill admit i began to drift away from nintendo and all of their kid games
my son who is  fell in love with all the good stuff nintendo has to offer and wanted a gamecube
we picked up a bundle one day and i was just as excited as he was to open up the box and plug the system in
we were instantly hooked and i quickly realized that nintendo still has it after all these yearsthis is just a great little system
reminds me of a small car that blazes by you on the interstatethere is alot underneath the hood of a gamecube
the games are full of color and great sound not to mention smooth action
the system itself is pretty small and lightweight
also load times are extremely short something i wasnt used to with the ps
i have found myself buying games for the gamecube that i wouldve normally bought on the ps simply bc of the short load times
we also picked up a wireless controller and that thing is insanely accurate dollars is money well spent on this systemthe nintendo gamecube is one of the better systems out there
it appeals although its not thought of to appeal to many ages and is a great system overall
the graphics are beautiful and crisp the sound is clear and cut and the load times are fast and quick
the system also has lan support and online gaming support
but dont let the features fool you though for the gamecube has great games
games such as resident evil the legend of zeldathe windwaker ea sports games resident evil  star fox adventures eternal darkness metroid prime and many many more
the system also has the best st party support making it a great place fo old classics like star fox fzero metroid mario and alot of other famous seriesi give it  stars because of no dvd playback or cd playback and because there is a lack of fine first person shootersi bought this for my daughter and we were both very excited to play our first game
unfortunately we cant save the game because there is no memory card
i assumed that it came with everything you needed
every other item ive ever purchased that requires a memory card came with one
oh well
its still wonderful to play and the graphics are great
the game were playing currently is sponge bob  battle for bikini bottom and my daughter loves when the controller vibrates when we smash the tikis
one questionis it normal for the screen to have lines on it during louder soundsin the days of the overrated  wii and snoozefest thats the  wiiu where do they come up with these names anyway lol  the nintendo gamecube still stands tall and is one of the best if your a retro gamer like me  you  know what im talking aboutsure it might look like a  little system  but it has powerthe gamecube has a fast  processor that delivers amazing graphics some that put the  wii systems  to shamefor example  whenever i play the gamecube metroid or  any of the star wars rogue squadron gamesi still go wow because the detail is amazingthe gameplay is always fast and fluid  its games like these that show off what the gamecube can do
the system also has a port where you can hook up your game boy advance gamesvia converter  which also adds extra valuenow in my opinionthis is the last great system nintendo producedwhy 
you might askits because the gamecube didnt have to rely on a gimmicky controller like the wii wiiuthe controller on the gamecube  works and is effective and thats all you need no weird motion thingy or a wannabe ipad interface here bottom line its all about the games plain and simple sometimes people tend to forget that and just focus on the hardware  the gamecube didnt dissapoint
sure  ive played the wii and wiiu and  lets be honest  they sure dont feel like nintendoeven in  the gamecube is still one of my favorite systems from the big n it ranks up there with the nessnes nto me these are the real nintendo systemsand when you say im playing nintendothis is what comes to mindthe fanboys might get ticked and start trolling with their negative comments and thats finebecause they have nothing better to do see my wiiu review for what i mean i laugh and laugh when nintendo came out with this little purple or black or platinum box called the gamecube most peoples first thoughts were of how small it was how odd the controller looks and how kiddie the games are
this led to people thinking it was a bad system and even as far as to say it didnt belong in the class of the xbox and ps
well people misjudged as this tiny little machine outdoes in almost every category the ps and in some aspects the xbox
the system the gc is easily better than the dc or the ps for these  simple reasons
 its small compact and yet twice as powerful as either of the other   this little cube has enough graphics power to dish out beautiful splashing water sharp fighting details sweat dripping from athletes faces and fiery eruptions that will make u put your hands over your eyes
this thing can bring a convincing world to your screen and is highly reccomended for anyone buying a game system for kids younger than  and even those of 
why
is this not reccomended for adults
its not that it isnt a good system or that it doesnt have good games the games are aimed at kids not adults
ok sure any mario game or donkey kong adventure can entertain an adult for a few hours
but it just looses interest as the computer ai isnt very good the riddles arent very challenging and the skill required to beat them isnt going to make you work very hard
most adults also dont like the controller which ill get to more detail in a minute which is quite small and cramped in many areas for adults and just looks a bitodd for those hardcore halo gta or even all those great sports titles
this system is aimed at kids capabilties this system is great for setting up in the car for a long trip accross the country or even state to state but it doesnt do much else but play those kid games
the memory units are extremely small compared to the massive xbox hard disk and ps memory card so youll often find yourself buying more memory units then games
thats no fun
this system also has no way to play dvds play music and cant be cleaned or fixed when the drive brakes the cd drive cant contain cd cleaners and cant be replaced with a regular dvd tray like the ps and xbox
the size of cds can also be a problem as many adults cant even fit their finger through the little circle in the middle or could loose them quite easily
it hasnt been the case for me but i have rather small hands still only  games this system has a ton of great gamesaimed at kids
if your an adult looking for a little gore smart fast computer ai or even the casual sports title to build a franchise through the gc is not for u
the major games are for the most part the marios zeldas donkey kongs star foxx etcall cartoons
you wont find the halos gtas socom navy seals or even games like splinter cell nor the controller to use them
if u want all of your games to be mariolike nothing wrong with that this system is ok  but for the more hardcore gamer like me an xbox or even a ps would be a better choice controller for games like pikmin perfect
huge buttons small joy sticks springy trigger buttons
its perfect
but for sports games like those that i love halo splinter cell games like that the controller is awful
it just doesnt work
notice that sega pulled all of their k sports titles as no one with a cube bought them
if u look at the top  selling gc titles you wont find a shooter except maybe metroid prime by nintendo
this system or controller just doesnt work for these games
on the other hand for games like mario melee zelda pikmin animal crossing etcits the best ever made
and if youve got lots of money to spend and dont mind owning a system just for one type of game then the gc will do just fine
but for someone with a low budget and wanting a little bit of sports rpg some shooters stealth and even mariolike games blinx crash bandicoot the xbox was for me also a dvd play and cd player gc doesnt support online plan none
it has a k adapter and works on broadband but nothing like xbox live or even the pss online network
no headset no stat tracking no buddy list and not a very big list of games
no real plan it just seems to be there
if u want to be left behind without the online gameplay of the future i guess the gc will do fine
but i am a gamer who loves playing other games like me keeping stat track trash talking and enjoying good competition besides my little sister or next door neighbor
the gc didnt suppport that
why
i dont knowoverall the gc is great for kids and good for the casual gamer
but for someone who is a low on money and would like a dvd player too b wants a controller and system that works with shooters and sports and c wants a few m titles in his collection the gc was not for me
this system will satisfy those looking for a system for kids a second system or even a first if they have a great pc
but i needed more and the gc didnt have itstill a great system with great games and is very reliable id reccomend the system to anyone who can live with the above problemsthxi own all three systems
ps sucks compared to xbox
gamecube though is in its own little world
you cant compare because the amount of nintendo exclusives it has
but gamecube has no games
thats the negative
the positive the games it makes are instant classics and the ones they make rock periodthe graphics are okay
there are a lot of kiddie games like pokemon and animal crossing and all those other little girl games
games like zelda and all the remakes are great
gamecube constantly moans and complains that they get no sales
they should do what they did for zelda remake the oldies
there sales will go up if they made remakes of mario games and donkey kong games
its not because they are kiddie its because we all grew up with these gamesanyway gamecube is just an average nintendo system
it is second best nintendo system because every classic is made on nintendo 
the occasional mario games are fun and any zelda game they make no matter how cartoony it is will always be great
the controls are good and loading times are faster then ps
in fact everything is better then psif you are looking to buy gamecube dont hesitate
with all the includings they include you can get the silver one with games controllers and meory cards
one word of advice dont get any type of action or sports games on gamecube
they are better on xbox and occasionally ps
get classics like zelda and some mario games and thats all gamecube is worthyes i have reviewed this systema bit to much i guesswell it seems like november is the perfect month for games as it has come out with all the killer games people have bin drooling on for
november is also the best month for gamecubeso far octnov has come out with some pretty good games and im looking forward to the new gcn games to come out
so far some pretty fantastic games have come out like metroid prime  mario tennis viewtiful joe  and the upcoming starfox assualt resident evil which the playable demo shown at e  is now avaiblable when preorderd the game and killer though i must agree with one review who said that mp didnt get lots of advertising
nintendo stinks at advertising this game
when mp was heard it was getting some hype but  hasnt got any that much
hopefully resident evil and killer  dowell thats all i have to say and yupnovember was the month of killer games i mean look at the listkill zonejak ratchet and clank metroid prime halo half life metal gear solid viewtiful joe mario tennisever quest iiectwelluh yeahlatesi bought this console only to play a few games that are exclusive of nintendo but this is a very good consolethe nintendo gamecube came out along with the hot playstation  and the newly introduced microsoft xbox
the nintendo gamecube could not compete with the ps and xbox of course only because it coudnt play dvds or cds
well it doesnt matter with this system it is still cool with a lot of great games like mario party and a lot lot morei have all  and the ps is the best then the xbox and then the gamecube
and it is a great price only 
 less than the ps and xbox
great deal great systemhad taken knocks but came as i expected it is still running and is a pretty good one
gamecube is a great console although wii totally overwrites iti bought my gamecube over  years ago and i still enjoy playing the games
its more of a kids system than a serious gamers system
it has simple controls and simple interface
if youre looking for a good cheap system dont mind it being old and dont mind ordering all your games for it online they dont have them in stores anymore then this is for youwhat makes a company like nintendo so great is that they stay loyal to the consumer
they dont make something and expect everyone to play it
they make only what they know there audience wants
though i am a advid sony fan and i will always have sony number  in my book
nintendo will always have a special place in my heart that will never be takin away
the gamecube the fourth system by nintendo is a truely remarkable product
what makes it so great is its completely a game list
what ever age you are or whatever games you like it will always have something for everyone
one truely creative and cool feature for the system is the small disk games that the system supports
every game is disk that is no bigger than your palm inless your a big guy
some people might not find this a big deal but it is because it differenciates the gamecube away from the other systems which use a dvd disk to format there games leaving gamecube with a nice cool look
many games for the game cube have game boy advance connectivity which with a gba conective cable they can conect with certain games on the system
the only knock i have at the system and this is a big knock is the lack of online gameing
i for one believe that online gaming is the future of the gameing industry
and gamecube does have an online adapter but only supports two games for online connectivity phantasy star episode    and phantasy star card game revolution
these games will appeal to some people but only a small few will buy the adapter for them knowing that these are the only games that support online play
also note that these these games require a monthly fee for play even knocking consumers down even more
but that is the only reason not to buy a gamecube
but to some people that is not a big deal because they dont find online play to be appealing
but in the end gamecube is a truely revolutionary system
with a great gamelist for the whole family it will quench anyone ones thirst for games weather you are a hardcore gamer or a gamer who just is in it for some fun you can rest asure that gamecube will deliever whatever you want in a gamei wont go on with all the technicle specs and obvious advantages it has over xbox and especially ps
all you need to know isit is the best of the threebuy it
best games graphics load times controller everythingpros the reason i chose this sytem over the others iswell i guess it was the price
i really wanted one of the new consoles and so i bought the cheapest one
and its good enough for me
the others have extra stuff that you dont really need for gaming
such as musicthe next reason i got the gamecube is because it has mario
mario games in my opinion are the best games you can get
they usually have great multiplayer and they can keep you entertained for monthsgamecube also has the best controllers
they seem to fit right in your hand
the other systems controllers are either flat or too big
plus the buttons are easier to findthis is just kind of a bonusi dont think it really matters but the cds are smallerit has the greatest game in the world super smash bros meleecons it probably has the least amount of third party support
most games are made for play stationya i guess thats all the cons i can think ofit took me a while to decide which game console to buy
after all there are now three major consoles on the market each boasting its advantages
in the end however i stuck with my old and stalwart friend nintendo
ever since the days of my original nintendo system back in the mid s i have frittered away countless precious hours of my life to playing games games and more games
i hoped the gamecube would live up to the standard of its predecessors and i was not disappointedto me one thing matters more than graphics sound etc
that thing is gameplay
and for a variety of utterly enjoyable and very playable games its hard to beat nintendo
my friend has a ps but since i got my gamecube i find we havent used it much
the gamecube is great because it contains such classic series as the mario series zelda starfox and one which recently returned to the forefrontmetroid
all in all i absolutely love nintendos games and find myself much more entertained with the games available on this system than those on the ps or the xboxto me this is the best system out there
its also the cheapest
if youre struggling with the decision of which console to pick i highly recommend the gamecubethe nintendo gamecube came out around  and from its begining to this very day it is considered as a childs system
theyre partially right about  of the videogames coming out are teen  mature rated only a fraction of them ever reach the cube restating the fact that this is for mostly kids
the console does pass at an  though
the graphics on nintendos latest console are better than ever but sony  microsoft are still in the lead
the design of the gamecube is well a cube duh
compared with the ps and xbox its the most compact of them allmabey not the slim ps so you can set it up almost anywhere
if youre a diehard nintendo freak then this for youanyone else may lose interest very quickly and buy another different console but keep readingas i said in the begining the graphics could be improved but  about  of the games have stellar graphicsthe controller in my opinion is the most comfortable for your hands than the other bigboy consoles
it dosent have a kajillion buttons like its underling the nalso it is smaller than xboxs mammoth controller
it sports  buttons  shoulders a joystick control pad and a camara changing cstickthe games are mostly st party gamesgames made by their console company with some big name multiconsole games
nintendo sticks to its roots with its original titles like mariomostly for kids donky kongparty gamekid game which uses bongos instead of a controller metroidfor teens and adults and my favorite the legend of zeldafor kids and teens and adults
then some other games like resident evil  the nba live series and prince of persiaid say try the cube at a friends house if you like it buy it or try the other consoles you will find one you like
if you thinking of getting this one here are some recomindations youll be satisfied mario sunshine paper mario  metroid prime  zelda wind waker  twilight princess resident evil  prince of persia and super smash bros meelelook for nintendos next revolutionupcom foreverplease know that i love nintendo and have owned all of their major systems
gamecube was the first of this generation of systems that i bought i now own a ps and an xbox
i love nintendo games so i am happy with it
if i had to choose only one system this would not be itpros nintendos own games eg
legend of zelda super smash bros melee metroid paper mario are some of the best in the industry
 the graphics and audio power of this unit are amazing
 the system is very portable complete with a handle for carrying
 the controller is very ergonomic and easy to usecons many major titles have not been brought to gamecube even if they are on xbox and ps
 the system requires that you purchase memory cards and a hard drive is not available
 online gaming is not available i think there might be one game and is not encouraged by nintendosure gamecube is cool best good graphics ps xbox they practicaly evry game looks about the same i used too hate the controls and the controller not no more
its the next generation system
but the xbox has the best graphics out off all of em ddesent controls and downloadable music and dvd player what more can u ask for yaknowps the best controls best controller out they folks but they brake too easaly from most gamers i heared of and sorta complicated
i cant explain it but i hate the controller now for some reson ever sense it broke and got a xboxwell over all for the cube it has the most fun games preety standered graphics but not the best we have seen the controls can get sloppy in some games good platinum color awesome nintendo
you can hook up your game boy advance or sp too hit and pick up a gameboy advanced player soo you can play your favorite games on your gba or sp on your game cube you can use your controller too you dont need your gameboy advance just hook it in and go for  bucksand gamecubes price is only  dollars now so people with not alot of money and want the next generation games just geta gamecube who cares what anyone thinks yaknowas a games retailer i have become keenly aware of the assets and drawbacks of each game system
the nintendo gamecube is often given short shrift when compared to the ps and the xbox
its often seen as a kiddy system appealing only to children and preteens
but when stacked up against the other two systems it is second barely to the xbox in overall quality
the gamecube features excellent graphics a  mhz aluminum processor and an ibm cpu second only to the xboxs  mhz and smooth even gameplay thanks to a three linked processors and twin emotion engines
this keeps framerates smooth load times to a minimum and allows for gorgeous graphics
its hardware isnt as complex as the xboxs but it makes better more efficient use of what it has
like the xbox it has four controller ports for mulitplayer use the ps has but two and requires a separate multitap for extra players and two memory card slots
it does have a couple of drawbacks when compared to the other systems though it wont play dvds cube games are minidiscbased not dvdbased and currently theres no online play to speak ofin terms of games the cube does have a smaller selection of titles than the other two systems
however this is largely due to the fact that nintendo keeps most of its gaming licenses inhouse doling out a few to select companies
this means that although there are fewer games the ones available are of good quality unlike ps which will license anything no matter how bad
certainly there are some bad games for the cubejust a lot fewer than the other systems
plus certain titles and characters are nintendo exclusives you wont find mario zelda metroid starfox or donkey kong anywhere else
they also have exclusive rights to the excellent star wars rebel strike
plus one can get madden medal of honor nba street and other popular titles for the cube
also nintendo has recently released a nice piece of hardware that expands the number of games available the gameboy player about fifty dollars hooks up to the cube and allows one to play gameboy games on the television
nintendo has often been criticized for having few maturerated games this is largely due to their focus on keeping games kid and familyfriendly
between the quality of games and the firstrate graphics and gameplay i have to say that this system is an exceptional value and is highly recommendedsuggested games mario party  and  luigis mansion metroid prime animal crossing mario sunshine super smash brothers melee starfox adventures legend of zelda windwaker fzero gx soul calibre mario kart double dashsuggested accessories when possible stick with the nintendo brand
theyre the best quality memory card  a musthave as this is the only way to save games a second controller available in blue black and spice orange for wireless play get the nintendo wavebird an excellent controller at a great price the gameboy player for playing gb games on the tv if you have an older tv without rca av jacks red yellow and white that has a cable jack in the back youll need an rf adapter about  racing wheel i recommend the logitech brand if travelling with the system i recommend the intec gamescreen which includes everything you need for portabilityquotps is the bestquot quotgamecube sucksquot quotxbox rulesquot  if youve read the reviews for any of these three systems its the same thing over and over
let me ask a question
how many of you have actually playedowned a gamecube and did not like it
my guess is not many
dont get me wrong playstation  and xbox are both wonderful systems and are worth purchasing
if you only have money for one however i would choose the gamecube and heres whylet me first start by saying it is the cheapest of the three systems but that doesnt mean it sacrifices anything in quality
what it means is that it cant play dvds doesnt have a hard drive and cannot basically run your life for you
what it is a compact diverse and just plain fun systemthe graphics are wonderful
and only cartoony in cartoonlike games  they are better than ps not bad but this is better and fall just a hair short of the xboxloading times are basically nonexistent on all but just a few games and those load very quickly
that is a huge advantage over their two competitorsi feel that they have the most diverse selection of games out of the  systems
they have zelda mario and metroid to name a few but they also have excellent third party games such as madden  nba live  final fantasy crystal chronicles skies of arcadia and countless others
for you mature gamers you have eternal darkness resident evil mortal kombat etc
so everyone get this myth out of your head this is not a kids system
sure it has games tailored to kids but it has plenty to keep older gamers coming back for morei think the gamecube controller is excellent
it is a bit different but you will find that the button scheme works well on all but just a couple of games
it works about as well as the ps controller and we wont even discuss the mammoth xbox controllerthe only real drawback is the lack of online play but that isnt particularly devastating
the fact that there are four controller ports as opposed to just  on the other systems and several addictive four player games more than makes up for that
if however you really enjoy playing online ps would be the way to gojust to wrap up i think the gamecube is an excellent system to purchase although i would still recommend ps and xbox as well
what i dont want to see are people that have never played the ngc spouting that it sucks because people depend on these reviews to make an important decision and i feel it is an injustice to comment on something for which you have little knowledge about
the gamecube is a wonderful system and definitely worth your ive been a nintendo fan since the snessuper nintendo entertainment system and i have enjoyed all the classics since then ecspecially the mario franchisenintendo gamecube is the latest in nintendos home console gaming and featues state of the art graphics wich were amazingin as you may know or not know nintendo is plannign on releasing a new consol soonvery soonso is this truly worth buying
read on and decide for yourselfgamecube had a strongstrong line up in the beggining of its life span with instant classics like super smash bros meleeduke it out in a crazy fighting game with nintendo classics
and star warsrogoue squadron or pit yourself into the realm of star wars and man your vehicle and prepare for war
even as the years rolled bynintendo got possibly betterwith hits like phantasy star online episodes one of the few online games on the gc great rpg and its multi player too
and sonic adventure  battle by working a few deals with segasadly the gamecube started to become sluggish lacking the online features other consols now fully supportet speccifically xboxnintendo went their different ways but still managed to produced multiple titles that still had major successkeep in mind gamecube prodominatley features multiplayer games and child based games but that doesnt stop them from releasing mature single palyer goodies like resident evil one of the best games of all time
dont forget the nintendo vault of treats to with all their franchises making epic returns and new arrivals animal crossing is very addicting think of it as a wacky the simsin a nutshell that issuper mario sunshine is marios way back into people homes with all his platformer goodness and one of the greatestlegend of zeldathe winder waker a powerful rpg conducted of elements from all the previous loz containing clean clear cell shaded styled graphicsall these good games and you wonder why a  starnintendo as i mentioned did superb but then started disabling many titles that came out on ps and xbox as if they wanted to kill off fanbase but still failed long live nintendo
with all that said you pick a gamecube up for a relatively cheap price considering all the other system costs of around ive had this system for over a year and nothing serious has happened yet
the good thing about the gamecube is the loading times especially on mario kart
there are  controller ports its small and even the discs are tiny
the only problem is that you cant listen to music or watch dvds
but it actually makes sense because its called gamecube meaning only for games
so far i only own  games spiderman  zelda wind waker nfsu and mario kart double dash and thats mainly because i own a xbox and ps and i play mostly m rated games
the controller is all right but the ps is still better in my opinionoverall this is a system for kids mainly because of pokemon and mario
but i doubt you will have any problems with this system and nintendo you can trustill start with the controller since that is not addressed very often
the gamecube controller may look funny but it dits rather comfortably in most hands and works well with most games despite the three buttons less than the competitions
the digital crosspad is not very comfortable to use i think because its sort of detached from the left handle making it hard to reach unless you have a long and very jointable thumbits true that the gamecube cannot play music cds or dvd movies and im not going to deny it that is a weakness
if you want to watch dvds play music cds and play video games all in one system the gamecube is not for you
there is also minimal support from third parties hence the long list of games available for the other consoles but not gamecube
im not a sports fan so the lack of sports titles doesnt bother me
the gamecube also has no hard drive and there are no plans to make one
online play is limited to one or two video games maybe a smattering more
there arent too many bloody games on this system because most third parties dont believe they blong there and nintendos inhouse development team is more interested in games not limited to adultsthe strengths of the gamecube rely on its firstparty titles such as animal crossing the wind waker super smash bros melee and metroid primethe gamecube does have a lot of titles that are mostly aimed at children but that doesnt make it a kiddy system per say
that is unless you think bloodrayne mk deadly alliance eternal darkness five resident evil titles red faction  blood omen  hunter the reckoning turok evolution bmx xxx which is uncensored on gamecube the true crime games dead to rights eternal darkness and hitman  are there just so mom or dad or an older sibling can play once in a while
maybe that doesnt matter to some hardcore gamers since many of these titles are also available on other consoles
i still think this is just a result of jaded game companies who havent forgotten or forgiven nintendo for censoring the blood in mortal kombat on snes and the sex in duke nukem  for nintendo the unit is rather small measuring about xx without the gb player attachment
its fairly durable and travelfriendlythe nintendo gamecube is a video game system plain and simple and if you want to know whats avaiable for it feel free to look for the many listmanias or so youd like tos right here at amazoncom or check the databases at gamefaqscomfirst of all this is not a bias reviewabout a year ago my friend got a gamecube for christmas
this is mostly because they couldnt afford a ps
anyway i spent alot of time at his house and before i bought my ps i played gamecube alot
i had hundreds of hours into timesplitters  which is a multisystem game but i was playing it on cube
here is my analisys of gamecube during that timegraphics  about the same as ps less than xbox
the framerate is not always steady but gfx are still greatsound  doesnt offer any support for dolby digital that i know of anyway
nor are there any digital sound outputs optical or coaxalonline play  although it offers a network adaptor and a dialup modem very few games actually support the feature even multisystem gamescontroller  not bad
i like it better than xboxs but less than playstations
i got used to it pretty quick thoughduribility  this has to be the longestlasting most durable system avaliableversitility  the only thing you are going to do with this thing is play games  thats it
no dvds no cds no homebrews
although there is a linux distro avaliable for it the site makes it sound like a pain in the butt just to boot it up
none of this may matter to some peoplegames  although this system has very few games what it does have are great
all the nintendo games are only on cube
honestly standalone this system wouldnt provide much entertainment after you beat the few games it has
but like i said what it does have are greatmy total and today i bought my very first gamecube
i liked it so much i bought one for myselfif you were to ask my opinion the first system you should buy is a ps then a cube and then maybe an xbox i really dont like xbox at alli hope this is helpful to people looking at a new video game consolethis game system is the best
i originally bought it used to save money
after a year or so it stopped working once and a while
i put the game in and turned it on and it didnt register that there was a game in there
i had to turn it on and wait for a whistle and lift up the lid until after an hour of trying it worked again for the playing session
it turned out that it is a relatively common problem for the laser to become unfocused
i had to buy a new gamecube and have not had problems since i bought it  years ago
the games are usually pretty good and the graphics are sometimes good
the controllers if left upside down on accident can get stuck in a position and can get ruined
but i dont recommend getting it now that nintendo leaves its old customers in the dust and stop making the gamecube and its games
the n lasted a lot longer than the gamecube
because of nintendo you are forced to buy the wii or the other newest game systems
if i wrote this about  years ago i would have said get the gamecube
but now it would just be a waste of money
save your money for an xbox  or a wiii waited in line on the launch day to get this system so i am a nintendo fan
i also own the ps and the xbox
my review is for someone who doesnt own any of the three and is considering buying one of the systemsgamecube is small but surprisingly the graphics that it can produce are at least as good if not better i was actually quite surprised by this
it is definitely the most kid friendly of the three systems but that doesnt mean that it is just for kids
nintendo is known for putting out great video games which you can only play on nintendo systems so if you want to play mario zelda metroid prime which i feel is the greatest game i ever played or pikmin you need to buy the gcthe controller is ergonomic but for fighting games and some sports titles the button layout does not work
i have seen controller converters where you can use the ps controller with the gc so you might want to look into that
this system does not play dvds
again it is a game console and does not try to be a multifunctional entertainment system
i am somewhat disappointed that nintendo is slow in producing games
the games are great but it seems like they put out maybe  great titles per each console generation and then it becomes obsolete
look what happened to the npros the cream of the crop games on this system are masterpieces
wont have to worry about your kids playing grand theft auto on this system
surprisingly good graphics and a  price tag
the hardware is probably the most reliable out of the threecons there arent too many cream of the crop games
you cant play grand theft auto
virtually no online gaming whatsoever
cant double as a dvd player
the controller is not universally suitable for all gamesim mostly a computer gamer but i also have this system
i find it hard to find good games that arent rpg or adventure
mariokart and madden are a few of the games ive been able to find for this system
what i like about this system is its cheap price and portability
i can easily move it within a couple of minutes to another tv
the graphics are not as good as xbox but they are satisfying
overall i think this system is good but its library needs a touchupthe gamecube is a very well rounded console
it manages to balance good kids games good family games and good mature games without tipping the scale in any direction
the n also did this very well which is something that the wii and wiiu cannot say
whether you grew up with a gamecube like nintendo or retro games or are an avid casual or party gamer i would definitely recommend this console for you
out of all the nintendo consoles the gamecube is th best out of gamecube isnt that good
heres the good and the badgoodits the cheapestyou could play clasic games like marioits the most portibleit has four playerbadits better fou younger kids like it has the least amount of gamesits not a dvd player or a cd playeryou have to buy a memory cardmost of the games are cortoonsi no longer play video games but my kids love this systemtheres tons of games for it and i admit i play super smash bros melee with them but i havent played a single player video game in yearsim too busy reading and listening to the radio but for those who have the time its a great systemof the three systems out now the ps xbox and gamecube the gamecube outshines the xbox but doesnt quite match the power of the ps
the gamecube is much smaller than the xbox meaning it doesnt take up a lot of room to set up
there is no dvd cabability present but if you allready own a dvd player it isnt a big loss plus online capability is on its way
not to mention that the gamecube is the cheapest system around right now
the first party games are naturally top notch games like super smash bros melee pikmin and the upcoming super mario sunshine and the new metroid and zelda games are great plus capcoms classic resident evil series is gamecube exclusive and segas dreamcast classics skies of arcadia and phantasy star online are on their way as well
however the controler is rather clumsy in design but if you can get past that there is no problem except the fact that the gamecube doesnt have as much third party support as the ps
all in all you really cant go wrong with a gamecube but the ps still outshines it by fara lot of people think that the gamecube is just a toywell if you want to get figurative then yes it is
but realistically it is a very powerful machine worthy of hype and expectation
ive seen things like this in reviews pros good graphics bla bla bla and best controllerbest controller
yes it has a great controller but that is a personal opinion not a fact
so lets state the facts
better texturing abilities than 
comfy controller design to most but odd button layout to many more
simply a gaming system no extra features
good or bad
many recognizable characters but almost no character development for yearsmario very enjoyable but always rehash
smallest polygon count but good textures means game looks good up close but large scale levels will hammer the system
smallest game selection of all but many recognizable facesall in all the gamecube is a competetor in the console world if you want to pay for a game system and thats all then get the gamecube otherwise youll be paying for a dvd playermusic machine yada yada yada when chances are you already have all of that
the best information i can give anyone is this games and systems have come quite a way since the beginninggenres have been defined inroduced and defined again franchises have been made series have all developed across every platform that people know and lovetheres always a few good series on every game systemso buy every one
ps xbox and gamecube
that way youll get mario sonic and halo to play
truth be toldif you are sticking with one system no matter which one it isyoure missing out on something elsewhen nintendo came out with this little purple or black or platinum box called the gamecube most peoples first thoughts were of how small it was how odd the controller looks and how kiddie the games are
this led to people thinking it was a bad system and even as far as to say it didnt belong in the class of the xbox and ps
well people misjudged as this tiny little machine outdoes in almost every category the ps and in some aspects the xbox
the system the gc is easily better than the dc or the ps for these  simple reasons
 its small compact and yet twice as powerful as either of the other   this little cube has enough graphics power to dish out beautiful splashing water sharp fighting details sweat dripping from athletes faces and fiery eruptions that will make u put your hands over your eyes
this thing can bring a convincing world to your screen and is highly reccomended for anyone buying a game system for kids younger than  and even those of 
why
is this not reccomended for adults
its not that it isnt a good system or that it doesnt have good games the games are aimed at kids not adults
ok sure any mario game or donkey kong adventure can entertain an adult for a few hours
but it just looses interest as the computer ai isnt very good the riddles arent very challenging and the skill required to beat them isnt going to make you work very hard
most adults also dont like the controller which ill get to more detail in a minute which is quite small and cramped in many areas for adults and just looks a bitodd for those hardcore halo gta or even all those great sports titles
this system is aimed at kids capabilties this system is great for setting up in the car for a long trip accross the country or even state to state but it doesnt do much else but play those kid games
the memory units are extremely small compared to the massive xbox hard disk and ps memory card so youll often find yourself buying more memory units then games
thats no fun
this system also has no way to play dvds play music and cant be cleaned or fixed when the drive brakes the cd drive cant contain cd cleaners and cant be replaced with a regular dvd tray like the ps and xbox
the size of cds can also be a problem as many adults cant even fit their finger through the little circle in the middle or could loose them quite easily
it hasnt been the case for me but i have rather small hands still only  games this system has a ton of great gamesaimed at kids
if your an adult looking for a little gore smart fast computer ai or even the casual sports title to build a franchise through the gc is not for u
the major games are for the most part the marios zeldas donkey kongs star foxx etcall cartoons
you wont find the halos gtas socom navy seals or even games like splinter cell nor the controller to use them
if u want all of your games to be mariolike nothing wrong with that this system is ok  but for the more hardcore gamer like me an xbox or even a ps would be a better choice controller for games like pikmin perfect
huge buttons small joy sticks springy trigger buttons
its perfect
but for sports games like those that i love halo splinter cell games like that the controller is awful
it just doesnt work
notice that sega pulled all of their k sports titles as no one with a cube bought them
if u look at the top  selling gc titles you wont find a shooter except maybe metroid prime by nintendo
this system or controller just doesnt work for these games
on the other hand for games like mario melee zelda pikmin animal crossing etcits the best ever made
and if youve got lots of money to spend and dont mind owning a system just for one type of game then the gc will do just fine
but for someone with a low budget and wanting a little bit of sports rpg some shooters stealth and even mariolike games blinx crash bandicoot the xbox was for me also a dvd play and cd player gc doesnt support online plan none
it has a k adapter and works on broadband but nothing like xbox live or even the pss online network
no headset no stat tracking no buddy list and not a very big list of games
no real plan it just seems to be there
if u want to be left behind without the online gameplay of the future i guess the gc will do fine
but i am a gamer who loves playing other games like me keeping stat track trash talking and enjoying good competition besides my little sister or next door neighbor
the gc didnt suppport that
why
i dont knowoverall the gc is great for kids and good for the casual gamer
but for someone who is a low on money and would like a dvd player too b wants a controller and system that works with shooters and sports and c wants a few m titles in his collection the gc was not for me
this system will satisfy those looking for a system for kids a second system or even a first if they have a great pc
but i needed more and the gc didnt have itstill a great system with great games and is very reliable id reccomend the system to anyone who can live with the above problemsthxoh and as for it being platinum its no different from indigo or jet black except its color and that its only going to be available for a few months
do u like platinumthis console is pretty good
it has a decent selection of games but most of them lean toward younger children that is the way nintedo has always been and will always be but thats great for the kids
they often have rd partys censor their games to not include themes that may be to mature for the younger audience
this is a great move to protect children but if youre older it does get annoying
if youre a bit older and looking for some mature games that arent geared torward the pre year old crowd the system has a few but very little in that category maybe a handful or more
gc lacks heavy rd party support and the little it does have make a few mature titles but are usually quick cash ins with little substance such as capcoms recent announcements
but there are a couple good ones to be found just very miniscule compared to the other consoles on the marketthe system itself is very small and thats great for fitting it in tight spaces
very durable as well
the system doesnt play dvd movies or music cds though just a special mini disc that play the games for the system
and because the disc are smaller it has less storage space so some gc games often include less content that the versions of the same game on other consoles
if you want a great game console that plays games dvds and cds then this isnt what youre looking for youd be better with a ps  in that casethe gamepad is great though
very comfortable but the button layout is a bit akward for certain games but overall its good
it also has  gamepad ports so  player games are definitely fun
but it does not include a modem harddrive and the memory cards have very little save space that get filled up quickley with certain games so expect to buy many memory cards down the roadthe graphics and sound are also impressive and most games have very fast load times
the system does not have an opticaltoslink output like the ps  does but it is capable of prologicii whch sounds great although not quite as nice as dtsoverall a nice system but limited in terms of features such as dvd cd and  playback and also very limited in variety of games and mostly geared toward children
it also does not have an online structure so you will not be playing games online for quite awhile if at all
but it is perfect for a child that just wants a bare bones console that has some excellent and fun games for their agei got my gamecube back in  which is if i remember rightis the year it came outsince ive had it so long ive grown to love it but save your moneyif i could id go back in time and not buy this
id buy a ps because there are so many games i want for iti am  and though most are appropriate for kids  i still enjoy them like harvest moon a wonderful life
but im a big rpg person so this system doesnt really satisfyprosgreat classic  legendary titles like harvest moon mario sonic final fantasy etcsmallminidisksokay graphicsconssmall rpg librarymost underrated systemvery little online gamingif i were you id save my money and get the nintendo dspsp when it comes out or wait for the gamecube  ps xbox  etc but if you really want a system now id get a gba sp or a psive grown to love it but i still think i should have bought something elsei bought a nintendo gamecube back when they first hit stores
it was pretty cool at the time
and i was quiet excided to see what nintendo would bring fourth with this system
well nintendo did what they typically have done in the pastmade some great games that are known for being nintendo only titles
such as mariomario kartzeldametroidfzeroectand then they made some games that were mediocre
what i liked about the gamecube when it first came out was that they focused on being a video game system
i bought a xbox  ps aswell
but around the time these systems dropped it was a huge selling point for xbox  ps being dvd players too
that was cool however i buy game systems cause i wanna play games
so that was cool to see nintendo stand out on that aspect
also i like  recommend buying the wavebird controllers
they were the first well made  accurate wireless controller
the bit nintendo nes had a wireless controller years ago too
but that was in the s
and the technology just wasnt properly implemented into the manufacuring of those wireless controllers
the wavebird controller is lightaccuratewireless of course and has a good range to react with the gamecube
another cool thing nintendo made for the gamecube is the adapter that allows you to play gameboy advance games on your gamecube on your tv
the gamcube came in various colors such as blackindigoplatinum
and had four player ports on the console
this system isnot hd
it has av inputs
in my opinion the gamecube is a overall pretty cool system
the controller layout at times needs some getting used to with some games
not the best system in my opinion but a good one none the lesssome of the best games for this system areresident evil  i think extinctionit has jill on the cover w a zombieresident evil  graphics are still the same as the n  ps versionsuper mario sunshinemario kart double dashfzerogodzilla destroy all the monsterssuper monkey ball   nba street   super smash brosdead  rights graphics are choppy but the game was funthere are many other titles that range between greatfairly good for this system
it is a nice console to own  have as part of your gaming collectionthis is a quality system
i have all  nextgen consoles and i find them to be very equal
they all have their pros and cons
here are the pros and cons for the gamecube followed by a list of quality titles with brief descriptionsprosgood firstparty gameslots of classic franchises metroid zelda super marioa carrying handlesmalllooks coolhas a cool logois made by nintendo
you cant diss nintendofun offline multiplayer games controller jacksinexpensivecan hook up to gameboy advances for extra featuresis necessary to play some games final fantasy crystal chronicles four swords plusfast load timesconsbarely anyno online supportno dvd playergames to buy for gamecubemetroid prime a fun first person shooter based on the classic metroid franchise
its basically like they took super metroid and made it d quality gamethe legend of zelda the wind waker once again you take on the role of link in this epic quest to save your sister and weild off ganondorf
probably the second best zelda game next to ocarina of timesoul calibur  available on other  systems a sequel to the classic fighter soul calibur for dreamcast
this game is a very good fighting game is fun in multiplayer and has link the main character from the legend of zelda series as a playable character which is exclusive to gamecube
xbox has spawn and ps has that old guy from tekken viewtiful joe the story of an average joe who while at the movie theater with his girlfriend gets sucked into the movie as his girlfriend is taken away by the bad guy in the movie
he then gets powers such as slow motion fast motion and zoom in
the graphics are very unique and beautiful in this game
also the camera is set so the game plays like a d sidescroller but it is actually dwell sortajust play it its greatsuper mario sunshine a lot of debate and harsh words are said about this game because people think the idea of the game is to clean up pollution
although this is part of the game it is in no way all of the game
aside from having to occasionally clean up some crap this imposter mario leaves around it plays similar to super mario  its very funsuper mario bros melee  probably one of the most fun multiplayer games out there next to bomberman  goldeneye and the super mario kart series
this game supports  simultaneous players and if you get you and  friends playing this game at the same time its hours of funresident evil  basically a rehash of the ps classic
ive never played it but i hear its very scary and very fun
unfortunately it costs more than the ps version which is why it recieved lower scoreseternal darkness sanitys reqiuem a fun horror game for gamecube
you take on the role of a girl whose grandfather is mysteriously decapitated in his mansion with no sign of intrusion
its up to his grandaughter to search the mansion for clues
what she uncovers is a book called the tome of eternal darkness which tells a very unique story of the universe which spans through many different characters from various time periods who all have a role in the story which you all play as
a very fun gaming experiencemario kart double dash although mediocre in singleplayer multiplayer in this game is very fungames to look forward tometroid prime  nothing is really known about this game yet except that it is a sequel to metroid primetloz wind waker  a sequel to wind wakertloz four swords plus you and your friends take on the role of little links the character from legend of zelda and use puzzle solving and classic zelda items to get through levels with each other
so far its shaping up to be a very fun looking gameif you had to choose between one of the  systems to buy id say theyre all pretty equal
i would base your decision on which pros and cons you care more abouti have own a ps for the past four years ive always thought that the game cube was childs play plain and simple i must admit that the cube appearance does not impress me so i never even tried this consolei have tried this system just for fun and was impressed by the graphics and gameplay so i decided to buy it
i have purchased a nintendo game cube the price was good oh my
this system is awesome
i am blown away guess what game i am currently playing
yes
resident evil  i cant give it a five star because i must try a few more game to see if the quality is the same goodbye playstation the cubes in town to staythe gamecube is a good system
it has the best games ever made and it has a cool design
some of the best games on this system are animal crossing super mario sunshine and super smash bros meleeunfortunately this console lacks features like online gaming and the ability to play dvd movies and music cdsoverall i recommend this console
however if youre looking for a console with lots of features then get the psthis is a newgeneration videogame machine an amazing little thing
this is the videogame who hosted the exclusives resident evil zero resident evil metroid prime the legend of zelda the wind waker eternal darkness sanitys requiem and so many othersgraphically it wins compared to the ps and loses compared to xbox but in some games the gamecube posesses even better graphics than xbox
talking about sound its perfect too it can record over a hundred voices for all ive heard i dont really know very much about hardware so i wont really get into that
in my opinion the gamecube possesses the best design of the three gamecube
ps and xbox new generation consoles
no offense but ps looks like a video and xbox is too heavy and too big and the gamecube is so compact you can take it and put it anywhere
how can such a little thing have so much power
it looks so perfectbut it has its bad sides too check them out it doesnt play anything but games
no cds no dvds thats bad but if it played it would be an easy target for illegal copies like ps and xbox are theyre getting a lot better with resident evil eternal darkness and some others coming but they still need more mature games in gamecube this is the only videogame who doesnt have silent hill series which i lovebetween the three new generation consoles i have choosen the gamecube because as a fan of the resident evil series this is the conlose which is going to make me feel happier with resident evil resident evil zero resident evil  and resident evil  already released resident evilcode veronica and resident evil  to come people say that ps has more games it is definetly true but the most amazing games in my opinion are for the nintendo gamecube ps does have many games but a lot of them arent good you know what im saying the design does have importance for me as i said there is no possibility yet of copying the minidvds and thats for me a great thing because i dont like illegal copiessee why i have choosen the gamecube
i hope you have this wise decision to buy yours because there are lots of games to come and lots of amazing games already avaliable
are you born to playthis memory card can not hold that many games
i only recommend this memory card for people whom just got a gamecube or only have a few gamesif you thought that  mb wasnt going to be nearly enough you probably didnt know that most games only take up about or  slots on the card which has  slots
but if youre looking to save sports games on here youll probably have to buy more than one if you want to fit other games on it too because those sports saved games take up tons of room
but still for  dollars its easy to buy another oneits good
thats it in a nutshell
i got it when i first got my gamecube on launch day and it obviously saved games with no flaws whatsoever
its what to expect from a nintendo brand memory card
however theres only  slots
some games take up  or  slots while others like sonic advance for example take up  slots
heck some sports games take up the entire memory card
its a good buy if youre not exactly a hardcore gamer but i would look into the memory cards with larger storagei am not here to complain about space in fact i believe the space is fine
if you do not already know this card has  slotswhich is fine for games like smash bros monkey ball and rogue squadron but have you ever tried madden
yes i recently purchased the highly reccomended madden  it lived up to its expectations
the only downside was the fact that when i saved this it took up an entire card
i think nintendo needs to get more space on their cards or lower the amount of spots games like madden   takeunlike the n you need a memory card for all of the games
this card although the norm for gcn is really small at half a megabyte
a floppy disk has about mb for comparison
however there are some other options
one is the mb memory card from interact but i am not to sure on the reliablity of it
however the big one is the panasonic sd secure digital memory cards availble at the panasonic web site
they are super reliable and range in size from  mb nowbigger ones are coming soon 
thats a lot of moola for a single card but thats big you can store  whole entire mario  cartriges on one stick
my advice get this and expect to buy a whole lot more or just buy one sd card for every single game you ever getgreat card works like a charmonly it save a few games how about a memory card the nintendo memory card  is a must for all gamecube owners
due to the discbased games that the gamecube uses you need a memory card to save your progressi highly recommend buying a memory card like this that is made by nintendo instead of a memory card by a thirdparty company that may be a few dollars cheaper or bigger because they are notorious for losing data
i have never had trouble losing data from a nintendo memory cardone note of warning is this  if you already have a memory card and plan on getting an extra or something wait until the nintendo memory card  comes out in a few weeks
the memory card  is almost five times bigger than the memory card  but it will sell for about the same priceeverything a memory card should be
it is a very important thing though so you should buy this with your gamecube
since it is called memory card  it has  slots of data
the only thing is that gamecube is not like ps or some other systems
all games are not  blocksome are up to  blocksto access the memory card when you turn on your gamecube system hold down the a button and then the screen should pop up
this memory card does its job and i recommend it i hope this was helpfullthanksvaporwell it works
plus it is the official card so you know it will work as good and more than likely better than anything else available
but its tiny
half the size of a ps or even an xbox memory card
and what is worse is that it is sectioned into blocks which as some may already know is very inefficient
to make a long story short memory blocks take up more space than they need to eating up memory a lot faster than a card like the ps cardthere is good about this card though
games tend to usually only take between  to  blocks which is comparitively small compared to the amount of memory that ps saves takegame cube is the first tv game console ive ever owned and ive only had it for  days but through my friends ive played most of the systems out there
gc controllers really are comfortable
n controllers are semicomfortable but you have to reposition the controller alot to reach certain buttons
nintendo has fixed that now with gc
im only  and i have average size hands but xbox controllers were too big for me to comfortably fit my hands on it
ps controllers were better than xbox but not than gc
the only button that is kinda wierd to press is the z button sticking out above the r button
it feels wierd because you have to move your index finder into a position you normally dont have it in
its doesnt hurt or anything it just feels a litte wierd
the different size and shaped buttons make it so you dont have to contstantly look at the controller to see the buttons
at first it takes getting a little used to it but then almost everything does
and even if you prefer ps controllers just but the ps controller adapter
gc and its controllers ruleit fits very nicely in the hands just like the super nintendo controller did
i wasnt too fond of how the n controller fit but it has a design that is similar to the playstation controllers and it fits very well in the handsim just glad it doesnt have the enourmous amount of buttons that the xbox controllers have and it isnt so thickagain very nice controllerunlike the n controller the gamecube controllers look like they might actually last longer than a few weeks without wearing down or falling apart
the only problem is that this split color indigo and clear looks ridiculous
other than that a pretty good controllerthe lcd screen for the ps one exceeds all expectations
the graphics are amazingly clear and the sound is nice and crisp
it simply hooks onto the back of your ps one and folds down for easy transport in a bag
the screen is super thin but extremely sturdy
this is a major plus because unlike the other lcd screens out there it doesnt add too much excess bulk or weight to the systembut please only get the official sony lcd screen
there are a number of low quality knockoffs out there that either suffer terrible burnin before long break easily due to shoddy construction or give poor picture and sound quality
this is the only one worth gettingthis was the very first game i got for gcn i got it before i got gcn
 and i was impressed instantly
this one very smooth and high quality game
it has all the modes you could ask for such as situation practice franchise createaplayer and two minute drill just to name a fewthe graphics are amazing and some of the best on gcn
there are over  faces for the players so rarely will you see the same face twice
and the players faces arent just paintings their mouths move as if talking eyes move they blink and everything
the game is so detailed that it throws on grass stains and helmet marks when a player gets slammed to the ground or takes a hard hit
the framerate is also very good it only lags rarely when you down on your own  or something like thatthe controls are easy to pick up too of course
each player has his own button for you to throw with him and it is easy to scramble as a qb and juke people out as a rbhb
catching is automatic so no worries about that
madden  has near flawless controlsof course there is always one downfall of the game and it is the difficulty
the game gets very easy up to allpro and when you advance up to allmadden the game is just too hard opposing players are extremely hard to tackle and break  yard runs every other playwith all the factors and everything combined this game gets aa yes my scale is kinda oddthis is an older title that is now very affordable and well worth the moneysimilar to may other games around at the moment including the hugely popular medal of honor  you control a special unit of soldiers through around  or so levels across europe during the latter part of wwiian array of weapons tasks and specialities are available to you as you equip up to  team members picked from a choice of  for each missionon each level which progressively get harder and require more task solving
the quoteasyquot level is actually not that easy and where the game scores i feel is in believability one head shot kills for example
the only aspect of the game i found annoying was the inability to pre select tasks for the group members you dont control
as you can only carry out the actions of one member at a time switching between characters is a little frustrating and those not under your control tend to act of their own accord during the mission if they are in the midst of the action
hidden amp dangerous was better from the point of view of being able to quotsendquot other team members to specific areas whilst you carried on with one but this is still very enjoyablefans of this type of game will certainly feel that it is money well spent and the game does keep your attention for many mnay hours as long as you dont cheat
definite two thumbs upunlike the first kessen its not realistic like the first one but its much better because you shoot thousands of rocks onto troops or shoot massive lightning bolts at them
also unlike the first you are inside the battle with all your troops which is amazing because theres up to  soldiers fighting at once in a battlebattle isnt the only thing you do in this game
you strategize which commanders you use and what route they take
also you can decide ways to improve your army like making your troops farm for more provisions or devolope new weaponsalthough not educational like the first one it took a good turn in the right directionas one of many players with a background in oldschool strategy  war simulation games i have played several installments of koeis romance of the three kingdoms
so naturally kessen seemed worthy of further investigationwhat you probably already know is that the kessen series covers the same historic period as the rtk series
and it has the same great personalities of all the generals
so what makes it uniquekessen is different due to the groundlevel view of events as opposed to  kingdoms very highlevel views
example in rtk you fight battles bythenumbers and the feel is like moving men on a chess board
the important decisions often happen before you ever enter battle and have to do with logisticswith kessen you are in the trenches controlling the body movements of individual generals in realtime as they engage the enemy
logistical decisions still affect the battles however the complexity of managing resources has been wiped so that the game can focus on the fight
decisions are very general and might be as simple as choose one to produce rice soldiers or weaponsis it worth it  fun to play
yes absolutely
koei did a great job on the execution and balance of the game
it can get a little bit button mashy but thats ok because you are enjoying watching the battle unfold and theres only so much a general can do at once anyway
its a bargain to add to your colectiononce upon a time in china two warriors liu bei and cao cao made a pact to take down the evil han empire
unfortunately c cao went all dark side on liu and the two ended up fighting each other
their epic struggle is the stuff of chinese legend and is recorded in a famous tome called romance of the three kingdoms
veteran strategy gamers know that koei and rtk are practically joined at the hip
so its no surprise that after launching kessen last year with an ancient japanese scenario koeis returned to familiar territory for kessen ii
this historical playstation  strategy games more show than gobut what a show
kessen iis visuals are primarily a spectacular display of computergenerated cinematics
you witness titanic clashes between armies awesome elemental magic attacks stunning ninja fights and ingenious asian instruments of war
its like watching the trailer for some awesome anime dvd
however things trail off dramatically once you get into the gameplay
the workmanlike controls dont ask you to do much but they enable you to adequately oversee  campaigns
you can easily select battle units and painstakingly move them into position with the overhead view contour map
the pacing here is very slow as you select and then move multiple units
it also takes several minutes for units to reach their positions but at least you can watch some great movies as they charge forwardbattles are mostly won and lost from this vantage point
you spend a lot of time just watching but you also have the option of affecting the outcome by quickly zooming in on a particular battle to control an individual commander
a few simple button presses enable you to bust magic attacks and you can jam buttons to fight with weapons but moving around with the joysticks is slow and imprecise
kessen ii gets pop from nicely synched music and dramatic dialogue that you must hear to advance through the game
however since its translated from japanese and is so movielike in its presentation it occasionally suffers from stereotypically wacky dubbing
some dialogue doesnt match lip movement and a few voices dont fit the look and feel of the charactersyou hear ancient chinese warriors talk with the hint of irritating valley girl accent or a little stoner dude drawl
its humorous and entertaining but probably unintentionally sothis campaign comes off as unbalanced
its a decent battlefield challenge that marches steadily along surrounded by major cinematic fireworks
but the difference between the sheer energy in the cinemas and the painstaking gameplay is so striking that it feels like youre fighting battles less to win them than to see the next visual treatwinxp users with directx and nvidia viedo cards that cant see the beginning movie after install making the game unplayable  start menu run dxdiag display tab disable directdraw acceleration
remember to turn it back on after you are done
leave everyone a comment if it also occurs in vista and is a vaild fix too
currently additional downloadable quests from the manufacturer are not supported on the gold edition the wrath of krolm the balance of twlightthis is a very fun game to play it is also aggravating complex and hard as heck in a couple of places if you dont cheat glares at cheaters but it is a blast to play and really fun of course if the rogues let a troll kill off my tax collector one more time because i havent placed a bounty on it yet i will level their guildhalli really enjoyed this game when it first came out so i got it for nostalgia sake
the gameplay is fairly unique and i find it challenging
all told it is fun and a great valuefirst off this game ran just fine on windows  bit without having to mess around with compatibility mode or anything like that
i just installed clicked the exe and had some funthe funny thing about this game is the fact that even after  or so years there has yet to be an rts that is so refreshing in gameplay
im not saying this is the best rts im just saying it is a refreshing change from what we gamers have gotten use to
just in case you didnt know in majesty you have no direct control over your units
you can build buildings do research to upgrade items or abilities and even cast mighty spells throughout the map but the one thing you cant do is control those who follow you
you can entice your units with gold but in the end they do what they want to dothis type of gameplay gives the game a special charm
each hero or heroine is born into the world with their own randomly generated name which allows you to distinguish the brave ones from the cowards and the foolish ones from the wise
they also seem to have a personality of there own i could just be imagining it though
for example ill have a level  knight who always goes head on into danger while ill have a level  knight who always plays it smart and flees if he thinks he is in over his head
this type of gameplay allows you to get attached to certain heroes
youll get so attached that youll find yourself spending money to cast your healing spell on that level  paladin who youve watched get out of tougher scrapes than going toe toe with two vampires and werewolf but who just ran out of healing potions and is about to bite the dustyes the game shows it age especially on my in monitor but it is still a very special rts with its own charm
i would caution gamers to not buy this oldie if your expecting a traditional starcraft or red alert gameplay but if you want something new to the old hashed out rts theme then this game is well worth your whileon a personal note the charm of this gameplay makes me wonder if majesty is wrongly labeled a rts
actually its more like a dungeon and dragons meets simcity with rts throw in there
i dont really know what to label majesty but i know itll be on my hard drive for years to comemy rigamd phenom ii x gb of ddr ramgeforce gtsupdate i downloaded this game and played it on my wifes laptop
she has a toshiba satellite running vista with a  ghz intel core duo gb of ram and a integrated gma  video card
the game installed and ran fine but it would only play in a  x  resolution box with a black frame around the box
on my bigger computer the game played at the same resolution but stretched to fit my  in monitoralso i dont know why others are having so much trouble
in my experience this game has worked on both a vista and windows  machinei picked this game up on a whim
i had no idea what it was about or even what genre it fit into
all i knew is that it was old
after spending an hour or so getting over the counterintuitive interface i was gripped
this game beckons back to the days of openended consequence rpgs like the early ultimas and the krondor series
you are a nameless hero and have been thrown into this prison camp with only a message and a prayer
it is up to you to try to find a way out
choose your allies choose your martial path
your are your own creatorgameplayas stated getting used to the controls is tricky
the game was primarily designed as keyboard only
the mouse was only added in on the recommendation of a magazine and it shows
this however is only a minor fault as a little gameplay will easily get past this design decision
the game is fairly openended especially towards the beginning when you spend your time learning who is who
its also fairly challenging in the beginning you can go anywhere your only limitations being the strength of the wildlife around you
as you get stronger your world thusly enlarges until you have free reign of the prison camp
this allows for hours of fun for those who like to wander and explore
the game also has little niceties that add to the worldly flavor like being able to cook your meat mine ore make stew blacksmith some swords etc
days cycle and they take their time doing it
the daynight cycle takes around  minutes which is long enough to feel right
the npcs have daily routines so at midnight theyll be in their homes while daytime will find them hard at work
this level of detail is hard to find nowadays
the only gameplay problems that occur have to do with the complexity of running a storied game in a freeform world
since you can kill anyone you want you might find yourself killing someone that advances the story
this problem is easily solved by the old rpg mantra save now save oftengraphicsthis game is starting to show its age
sure there are low polygon counts and sure the textures look bland but hey  thats what x aa is for
this game is one that ignores the prevalent trend of graphics first content second
the games engine is still complex enough to allow for amazing vistas with its far horizon and sundry landscape
the  yearold graphics will be the last thing on your mind once you get into this puppysoundthe sound is nice its your standard preeax ditty
no noticeable environments but again no one is complaining
the ambiance is well thought out and i can swear more modern games have stolen gothics soundtracks as the music seems very familiar
everything is voiceacted and done quite well
the weapon magic and enemy sounds are varied enough to keep you interested and there was never a time when i ever wanted to play on muteoveralli highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone who enjoys a good wellthought rpg
the decisions you make in the beginning and the sheer pleasure of the game will even allow for substantial replays as you go after the stories threads you had to pass on your first time throughthe only thing keeping this thing from  stars is the glitchyness caused by an engine at the engineering maxes of its time
but keep in mind all other things considered this game is perfecteu is one of those games where you have to think long and hardbefore you make your moveyou cant just take over a countryyouhave to think how big the army is how big is yours and so forthuseing diplomecy instead of force is also a good ideathe choiceover  nations means that the replay value is quite highgraphicssoso musica difficultyyou bet overalla eu forumaso if you a like historybased game that might make you thinkthen get euthis is a good game but be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into it
some of my fellow reviewers seem to think that this game is too easy
this may be the case if you play it for months or longer
but it certainly is not a game you can pick up and play over the weekend
there simply is too much going on and too much to handle
and the casual gamer will soon wish for more obvious feedbackthis doesnt mean the game is bad though
quite the contrary
just be aware of the commitment you will have to makethis is a game that is like nfl
blitz just hockey
because of how it is very unrealistic
there are  players on the ice
codes for using a hockey ball or tennis ball
goalies get checked and can check
players become on fire
you can be aliens soldiers poneys totempoles and about  others
there also are no penalties
this though is a fun gameyouve gotta love watching a little sorty fatass beat the hell out of some huge buff quot guyespecially when shorty has a donkey head
haa good hockey game but gets its stars from its comedyever since i got this game i could not put it down
my favorite part of the game is the records page in which me and my brother continually compete for the top spot
the fast pace makes this game incredible with never a dull moment
another amazing component of this game is the interactive crowd
instead of the dull blur of the crowd in other games this game features an interactive crowd that has seperate animations for each situation in the game
such as a big hit a a goal score this is the st game ever for this feature
the fast pace and exciting games make this game a winner
being a hockey fan myself helped me love this game
go stars
pros awesome graphics fast pace game youll play over and over again well worth your moneycons extremely addictive you will find better games on the gamecubethis is probably the classic strategy game on a pc
my son loves this game and so do i  while it has lots of options for each nation you can play there are not too many options like in yuris revenge
some maps are excellent
and you can create your own maps pretty easily with a free online program called final alert it seems that ra crashes a lot from internal errors and that no one has published a way to solve this problem
even so the game is dangerously addicting because it is so fun to play
probably the best war game we own on any systemif you have more than one pc that can go online via your isp simultaneously you might want a second copy so you can play with someone you knowthats even more funthis has to be one of my favorite pc games
despite the cheesy cutscenes and lame actors the game does a good job of what its supposed to do have battle sims
the story doesnt seem as cheesy to me as others say it is and the skirmish is the most fun ive ever had on the computerif you dont like the game then blowing apart the enemy with  fighter planes is something you should try
also the demolition trucks and terrorists are pretty fun to just line up in an empty space and mass destroytake that bin laden   all in all aside from cheesy cutscenes and poor acting this game is top qualityit is better than red alert  and that is a very easy mission toaccomplicethe good part in this game is that you can put soldiers inside buildingsbut the first game in this series is the best onebuy it im not stopping youred alert  has everyting that everyone wanted in red alert  it has better grapics a better story and fresh units
both the soviet and allied single player mission are great and fun with interesting twists
as usual westwood studios has given us a great game with a good backstory and bad cinemas but since most people dont even watch them it doesnt really matter
yet there is one problem with this great game its too easy
if you start the single player missions on normal it can be  challenging to beginners yet after a while it can get dull even on hard
yet westwood puts in a solution to that too
since the game features single player skirmish battle and a wide array of multiplayer games
its one of the best rts games ive ever played
if youre into rts games this is a must havethis is a fun game
i am not sure there is much higher praise that you could give a game nowadays
thats what really matters when we are playing is if we are having fun and enjoying ourselves
sure the graphics matter too and they are quite impressive in this game
when i first started i was pleasantly impressed by the sharpness and how good it really looked
but my last experience with a tony hawk game was briefly playing thps on the ps
i did get to see thps on the dreamcast and i was impressed with the graphics on that game but i personally had not played a thps for a good length of time since the first one on the psand just like the first one this one is fun yet challenging
tony hawk games never seem to be easy but they dont seem to be overly difficult either to where you just get frustrated and quit
there is a nice blend with fun and difficultyone thing that i really like about thps is the varying missions that each level presents
they are creative and some are humorous
this seemed to start in thps but again i really didnt play that game muchfor tony hawk fans i need offer no recommendation for this game you already know how fun these game can be
but for those that own and gamecube and are unsure about this game this is one that i feel is worth giving a chance
i do not feel that i have wasted my money and i am more of an rpg resident evil legacy of kain kind of games fan
so this game really isnt in what you might consider my type of games
it is however fun and again thats what mattersi liked all tony hawk games
this is the best one of course the only problem is that it gets boring after playing it
i would suggest this for playstaion instead of gamecube
other then that there are alot of charactors and its a cool gamepro skater  is on a higher platform but its still the same great skateboarding game that it has always been
you can play as one of  pro skaters in skate parks located around the world such as japan canada and a cruise ship
not much has improved except for the graphics and the fact that people can now be found in the skate parks
there are however new challenges other than scoring points and jumping gaps
now you can impress people to earn cash
rather than buying stats like in pro skater  you now must earn them
there are also more advanced create a skater and park editors with different ramps hazards and schemes like a beach
after all of that has been said because i have played and beaten the past two games this game offered only a weeks worth of challenge
there is now smearing blood in the gamethis is a good game but i personally have had enough grinding and flipping on a skateboard
this game features new skaters new courses new boards for your skaters and an updated makeacourse feature
this game is definately worth buying but the series might die down after number four
you should probably rent this one before you buyfor those of you unfamiliar with the long running tony hawks pro skater series you control one of many proffesional skateboarders or one of your own creation around various locales trying to complete goals
these goals include scores collecting the letters skate finding a hidden tape or finishing some randomized goals for each level
you can grind grab or flip just about anything you see and the controls for these tricks are mapped perfectly onto the gamecube controller the only problem being the slightly too small b flip button
the newly added revert trick allows you to continue combinations out of vert tricks letting you score a great deal higher than in the older games in the series
the only noticeable problem in the game is that the vert ramps are few and far between so you are going to have to learn a whole new set of grinding skills if you want to have a chance of getting the high score on the levels
very highly recommended for players of all ages although parents may want to watch out for the lyrics of the songs and the blood that appears after a nasty spillwhile its the weakest thps its still great
if you have an xbox or a ps get it on one of those
if you only have a cube its still a solid title to add to your collectionother reviews have gone into what a great game thps is i think it is too so ill let them tell you how great it is im going to compare the two major versions available pc amp psx versions excludedi bought thps for gamecube as a test the next time a game comes out for both ps and gamecube which one do i buy
the answer it dependsthe most noticable difference between the ps and the gamecue version of this game is that there is no online play for the gamecube version but it isnt like that matters since neither system has released their online adaptors yet
so until sony and nintendo have their network adaptors who cares about dialup on store shelves or in my case in amazon warehouses it is a moot pointgamecube advantages faster framerate for smoother motions slightly better graphics nothing to really scream about though and it also wins out in the same battle n won over psx better d environment
in other words you dont end up seeing through sections of walls or having it appear that the camera is now located inside of your character revealing the empty reverse of his hollow body
sure this does not occur nearly as much as it did in psx games but it still happensps advantages well there is only one that i have found
lip balances
on occasion with the gamecube version when you try to grind on a surface you may instead end up doing some antigravitational lip balance
now this wouldnt bother me so much if it werent for the fact that when it happens the camera angle tends to shake jitter uncontrolably
this may just be a bug in the game hopefully it is not a gamecube thing that is going to occur in other gamesme im keeping my gamecube version and selling the ps version to a friend but that does not mean that i am going to buy a gamecube version over a ps version
if a ps version comes out with better options im getting the ps versionit has been a while since i played this game but it is a fun game and keeps me playing for an hour or sothere just have been so many games that are just so nostalgic they keep coming back better and better
there are times where it either keeps getting better or just keeps losing ground
that has happened with so many different classic games like pacman donkey kong and it has happened again with the most classic addictive puzzle game of all time tetris
since this game originated from russia in the s it has taken on the world by storm and just keeps surprising so many different gamers of all ages
yet while so many just variations lose ground from tetris others just come out swingingtetris worlds is a collection of six different variations of tetris that really are just amazing
there is the classic tetris as well other recognized new variations of the game including hotline tetris the learning game learning tetris which is more like a basic instruction game that teaches people how to play tetris fusion tetris sticky tetris and square tetris
the graphics are just gorgeous and the gameplay is very simple to operate with the push of a button on the keyboard
there are also the  classic modes from tetris for all these games such as the story mode and the arcade mode where you have to beat the clock to try to clear as many lines as possiblewhile you look at so many games that depend on out of the ordinary graphics it is sometimes so easy to forget about classic games like tetris
if you have played the game before tetris worlds is a well worth buy for the computer
if you havent played this puzzled legend before it is definitely worth the try
dont be boxed in without trying this great delightful gamegraphics bsound bcontrol afun  enjoyment boverall b one of the most well balanced games ive seen
if you have a gamecube get smugglers run on it because its just an improved verson of this game
the only thing i dont like about this game is how they still took out the animals and pedestrians when you play the game multi player
what else are  people gonna do on free run mode
come on rockstari call this kind of game a scripted first person shooter
the gameplay is fun but linear leading you down a path with very little openendedness
its a bit like playing a character in a movie where you must follow the script
other good scripted fps games are half life and medal of honor
no one lives forever is one of the best of this type game
it is a very long game so you get your moneys worth and it never gets old with a great variety of locations and a good story
the game of the year edition also includes  new levels in a volcano at the end source code and editing tools to create your own levels and mods the in the lounge music cd an excellent music cd on its own but i think this also came in the original packaged version so its not really fair to say its a bonus with the game of the year edition and a free strategy guide
the only major problem i had with this game and the reason i deducted a star is the stealth aspect
to me the greatest stealth game ever made was thief the dark project and nolf comes nowhere near the excellent stealth missions found in thief
in nolf you must be stealthy in certain areas but there is generally only one way to sneak past these areas not allowing you to get creative with how you approach these areas
if you want the apex of stealth try thief or thief  instead
that said however all other aspects of nolf are excellent
visuals sound quality and weapons are all very well done
and the story is great though the cut scenes tend to go on a bit too long
and you wont find a funnier fps around
i laughed out loud at several points listening to the other characters talk and there are several sight gags also
i wasnt expecting these so it was a nice touch
the scenery looks great with wonderful atmosphere and a good sense of place
obviously this game was made with a great attention to detail and love of the material by the designers
and since its a couple years old it runs nice on older computers
it ran perfectly on my pentium ii  with a  meg video card
it is definitely a classic and a musthave for any serious game player or fps fan
get it while you canlike they say no one lives forever
step into the fearless andbrave shoes of cate archer and fight harm and other evilplus save the world from evil as unity
graphicsfunsoundaboveaveragemusicfunoverallfunny and funbesides the point ifyou are a kind of person that likes funny first person shootersagent type games this is your gamei first bought this without looking at the reveiws at amazon but i found i thoroughly enjoyed it
it was the first tycoon game that was in d which was why i bought it
i really like tycoon games
this one was great
the missions are clearly possible the graphics are great the gameplay is great and the structures look really cool
even the inflatable houses look neat
there are some cons though
such as  the screen movement is choppy and its very hard to keep your budget in tact
in the reagular version you start out with  dollars to build your entire colony
when you finally finish you can look back at your work and enjoy it because the layout they made is beautiful a real eye opener
i too wished when i was playing this game that i could just settle in one of my colonys
it is clear how any sim would want to settle in on someones colonyrecommendations i would recommend this to anyone who is good at keeping good budget at these gamesnot recemmended to gray davisthis game is very similar to simcity
if you enjoy playing simcity you will probably like this game too
because the setting is on the moon you will have to think over some other materials that would not be any matter on simcityin moon tycoon you should think about oxygen besides water and electricity
you will also face pollution problems just as what in simcity
you can also create your own city the way you like
you can make it sparkling as lasvegas by building entertainment places or you can build scientific building for educational purposesin general this game is interesting and it comes with pretty good d engine that enables you to rotate in any direction and zoom in and out to your convinientingredientslarge spoonful of slimey teethfresh smoke steam and dripping waterpinch of doom garnish liberally with terroras a big fan of the alien films ive launched myself into a lot of the tiein games that have been released over the years including the genesis supernes gameboy and playstation versionsmost of them  including this latest incarnation follow the same basic plot  government agents with machinations of global domination stumble on alien beasty and take it home for show and tell
said alien escapes and there follows much running and screaming in steam filled corridors
however this game sets itself apart from its long lineage with a truly immersive survivalhorror experience
depending on how you look at it this game is best played on your own with the lights off and the sound up
for better or for worse this game scared my panties offyou can play as three different species each with its own weapons and characteristics and all with an intertwining plot
choose the alien and youll be running up vertical surfaces and biting people in the face
with the predator youll get to play with lots of shiny gadgets like heatvision yeah like in the movies and various stabbychoppy weapons for taking off heads literally
and as the poor weedy human marine its back to d shooter basics with pistol shotgun fastbutweak machine guns and lots of sweatits the marine single player game that really shines as you creep around lots of abandoned military installations movement tracker bleeping
if youve watched the movies youll know its only ever a matter of time before something with big teeth and an attitude problem jumps out of the ceiling at you and man does this game deliver
expect to jump frequently firing blindly into the darkness at the very scarily accurate alien hordes
sometimes there will be as many as six or seven of the critters bearing down on you and the crisp graphics really excel in bringing the movies to lifeas far as the alien and predator games go the tension is somewhat diminished since after all youre the monster now
its initially very amusing to watch the ai controlled civilians quake and scream at your approach and theres lots to be said for the aliens acrobatic talentsyou can leap huge distances and explore airducts and sewer systems with easehowever youll probably find that sooner or later the alien and predator missions get fairly samey
still theres lots of great graphical effects on show with great smoke and lighting throughout all the missions
again the sound is excellent with distant screams and scuttling behind walls bringing everything to terrifying lifethe online multiplayer game is also very well balanced and features a nice variety of playing levels and game modes with more downloadable from the official site
in the long term this is where the game stands out since beyond the marine missions the single player is really a oneoff affairoverall this is a good solid game with some stand out moments in the single player and lasting appeal in the multiplayer
it is both violent and gory so the sqeamish should probably shop elsewhere and for obvious reasons if you didnt like the films this is probably a poor choice
but for both film and horror shooter fans alike alien vs predator  is a game to sink all four sets of teeth intoif youve ever wanted to play as a predator or a alien than this is the game for you
there are  campaigns the marine the alien and the predatorthe graphics arent great but there ok  this game also has one of the best multiplayer
however people that use aimbots or wall hacks can really ruin the experience which is why i usally only play with my friendsaliens vs predator  is a very very good game but it could use some improvements
first off the graphics could be better i know its made in  but it could have been better
second i should have been longer
each campaign was  levels long and it could have at least  levels longentertainment story gamplay controls graphics sound overall you can find me on youtube if you want to see gameplay subscribethis is the best first person shooter ive purchased in quite a while
singleplayer was rather enjoyable
sound was nice and eerie
graphics were rather good even if they did reuse the scenery way too much
but what really makes this game shine is its actors
whether you are playing as a marine a predator or an alien you really become that characteras a marine you are sent to investigate a colony that has been ravaged by aliens
then you get separated from your squad and things start to go really bad
its dark and scary and as your little motion sensor beeps away you find yourself jumping at every turn
it feels exactly like the moviesthey nailed the predator too
all his famous abilities and weapons are at your disposal which pretty much makes you one unstoppable killer
turn yourself invisible
switch to infravision
jump from treelimb to treelimb
then decimate your prey in any number of ways
you are a predator and the game captures that feeling perfectlyfinally it is the aliens that truly make this game for me
they can walk on walls
they have acidic blood
a sharp sense of smell
fierce claws and a whiplike tail
sickest of all they eat their victims to regain health
the aliens can be rather disorienting to control at first but once you get the hang of it you are sure to fall in love with the little critters
it really makes you think and play in a totally alien manner very originalsingleplayer was a lot of fun but multiplayer really makes avp ii shine
take the three species and throw them in an unforgiving arena and see which is the fittest
it really is hectic and quite a ridehowever there  is one aspect of multiplayer that really needs improvement
the game launcher
when you go to find  an internet game to join it lists all the servers along with the number of players the ping and the game types
you can then sort the game by any of these aspects to find just the game you want to play
it provides filters to make this even easier but unfortunately there is no way to save your filter preferences
instead you have to put them in every time you want to find a new game
this is really a nuisance
there is also no way to remove all the servers that require a password would be nice or download the map from the server if you dont have it instead of getting kicked out
maybe im asking too much but other games like halflife have been able to solve these little inconveniences for years now
maybe after a few more patcheseither way once you finally get into a good server you are in for a real good time
death match doesnt get much more fun than thisthis game is a vast improvement over the flawed original
for one the graphics are much better though not as good as some of the newer games out there
still they arent bad and the atmosphere in the game is wonderful
where the original felt more like a runofthe mill shooter wherein the player mowed down hordes of aliens or humans if you played as the alien or predator this one still has you facing hordes of enemies but does a much better job of emulating the movies creepy feel
as an example the first level in the marine campaign has absolutely no enemies in it but it is imo one of the best levels in the single player game
though there are no foes scripted events abound as you cut off from your team try to make your way back to them
as you go along youll bump into a few survivors and before you can do anything see them slain by the predator with suitably tantalizing glimpses of the cloaked predator
youll find evidence of the aliens and predators handiwork all around something will rattle through a duct nearby things will break or otherwise go haywire in such a way as to make you jump
the atmosphere is pulled off quite well in the predator and alien campaigns as well though they are not as creepy as the marine campaignbeyond that the encounters for each race seem fitting and all of the races are fairly well balanced
the alien cant take a great deal of punishment but its fast and lethal if it gets in close quarters and it can climb virtually any surface the marine isnt terribly durable either but with his motion tracker and a devastating arsenal he can be a match for either of the other two races the predator is fairly tough and has some good weapons but not anything as purely destructive as some of the marine weapons
the alien campaign also has one particularly cool feature in that you start it as a facehugger your goal then is to avoid the humans until you can find a suitably isolated host
once thats done you become the chestburster the child stage of the alien again you have to sneak around until you grow larger
once that has happened you become a full grown alien and the fleshrending fun begins if i have any complaints its that the minimum requirements for this game are a joke
as with most graphically intensive games your ram and the quality of your d card are more important
if you have a decent d card and  or more megs of ram you should be okay however if you have only the  megs the box calls for the game will stutter a lot even in the lower detail ranges
 that and youll want to do a full install for maximum performance
the nearly one and a half gigs that the full install eats up can be painful if you have a small hard drive 
though its a fun game at any detail level being able to max the graphics out certainly helps to sum it up this game is definitely worth the money and a good follow up to the original though youll want to have a fairly beefy computer to run it wellthis game depends on a persons particular taste and whether or not they have a pace maker or not
a love for a scrawny fps will have you drawling at the screen as you back pedal down a vent shaft whilst spraying randomly into the face of the three aliens clawing there way along the ceiling totally intent on sucking out your brain
and of course if youre an alien  predator fan then youll have the same kind of liking to the scary atmosphere of the alien series
however for those who like to be able to see what theyre shooting at and like to stand and fight instead of leg it and shoot backwards perhaps this is not for youthe game is clearly a scary thing to play  close the curtains and turn out the lights gives the ideal atmosphere and i suggest a good sound set up and even better headphonesyou may have read other reviews that state how you can play as the alien predator and marine and that is true but i find playing as the human characters by far and away the most fun because theres nothing like pumping away with the shotgun at an alien with no legs left until it turns to liquidbeing serious though the graphic content is excellent the modals are well rendered what you can see of them and the lighting effects really make you wish the flashlight on your shoulder hadnt just run out of powerthere is a massive array of weaponry with the marines and if youre the predator you have your nice long claws to enjoy and of course the famous shoulder cannon that the predator uses in the films
when playing as the alien you start life as one of those worm things and then you eventually grow up into a fully armoured acid licking killing machine that can walk on the ceiling and cut peoples heads off
grose
i often say to people when they say this movie is really scary that its only a movie how can it be scary
but i really can tell you when playing on this game you really will need a cloth to wipe the sweat off the mouse as you fight to stay alivethe scariest parts are when your walking into a semi lit room and you throw a flare in to see the room but then as you carefully walk into the middle you can hear the familiar ticking and scrapping sound and then the radar starts beeping and before you know it youve turned around to locate the alien so many times you dont know where you are and all the time its above you on the ceiling and when you look up and see it looking at you get that gun outso as far as i can see if its scary games and fpss your into this is a good choice of course there are others like medal of honour and cc renegade if you prefer a more skilled game more then the toilet treatment that goes on if you play avpthe multiplayer is for online of lan only so there are no computer player options which i was a little disappointed in because i like it when you can play infinitely against a computer especially in the hunt option where i could be a marine searching for a predator in the junglenever mind the single player really makes up for that
the game is however a bit too short
okay its still a big game but to todays standards where anything under  hours of single player action is short it has to be said it could be a little longer
but even though ive completed it believe me you will want to do it again on a harder skill level
and you can see why its short compared to most its because of the details thats gone into making it the levels are so big some of them and some of the open spaces where you have to walk along this pipe over a  foot fall really make you see how long it must have taken to design this gamethe levels are a little linear but dont let that put you off because what true fps isntall in all a great fps which is the best scary game out at the moment in my opinion
worth owninglike many i was first introduced to the concept of aliens vs predator through the dark horse comics
while i found the comics fair at best movie to comics adaptions are rarely good i am a huge fan of the alien movies except for the godawful alien resurrestion and to a lesser degree the predator movies
the concept was awesome but an alien isnt an alien unless its screaming that high pitched godzilla whine and a predator isnt a predator without those weird clicking growls
there have been rumors of an alien vs predator movie for as long as i can remember but so far no cigarwhen the first pc game came out i really looked forward to it
unfortunately i couldnt get into it
i thought the plot was mindless the controls were wacky and the multiplayer was unbalanced
the novelty of controling an alien or predator wore off pretty fast after a few frustrating minutes
once again a great concept was put to wastefor the first time we now have a quality product from the marriage of two great film creatures
this game rocks
the last shooter that i got this into was clive barkers undying
before that it was system shock  a fantastic and highly underrated game
they all have one thing in common tha ability to scare the crap out of me
the ambiance and tone of the game truly does the movies justice
i can think of several instances were i thoguht i was going to jump out of my skinthis game has it all great story great graphics great sound i should put specific emphasis on this one
i have surround speakers and the ambiance and sudden noises kept scaring the crap out of me and a lot of action
whats more they manage to capture the tone of each individual race and balance some of the issues that avp suffered from
the aliens were mincemeat in the first game but theyre much more frightening in this installment
theyre treated more like the aliens in part  and part  than the cannon fodder of alienseven if youre not a big fan of the movies or the comics i encourage you to try this game
its rare for a franchise game to please more than just diehard fans but this is one of those games
not since jedi knight has a movie based game captured the essence of a film so perfectly
if the single player games had been a little longer id probably give this game  stars
instead i can only hope that an expansion is in the works because i want morehaving unsuccessfully tried to play avsp and avsp gold because of incompatibility issues i took a chance and ordered avsp  i gotta tell you it was worth it
ive had a riot with this one
im still playing it and its a lot of fun
it takes too long to load after getting killed and sometimes you can hunt around for hours before learning how to move on but all in all its really a lot of fun
if you have windows xp home edition this one will workif youve read any of my other reviews youd know that im an old fogey that pines for the good ol days of firstperson shooters
i quotgrew upquot on a fattening diet of wolfenstein d blake stone aliens of gold and nitemare d
upon adolescence i was playing games like quake ii and the ultimate pc game unreal
ever since my gaming childhood ive been looking for a way to relive those experiences with a more recent technically advanced gamealiens versus predator ii fulfills many of my hopes
it looks great and the developers obviously went out of their way to make good use of graphics cards
many parts of the game are dark and you need to use special equipment or abilities to see in the dark and to see particular enemies
for example when you play as the predator you use a quotnormalquot vision mode to see the details of the level youre on a reddish vision mode to see aliens and a bluish mode to see human marines
not only do these modes look cool but they also enhance game playin addition to the predator you also play as a marine or an alien
you have lots of fun as either one and like the predator you experience unique abilities and limitations as each character
it all works very well and all three characters you play let you see the same world and story from a unique perspective
very well doneperhaps the best part of this game is the atmosphere
it does a good job of making you feel that youre on a spooky alien world and danger is never far away
the ai is good and it lends the impression that your enemies truly hate you
the levels are well designed allowing you to interact in a rather realistic way
just be ready to be startled
i jumped quite a few times playing this gameso why only four stars
its because of the bugs
most of the game is pretty stable but i ran into a bug playing as the marine in which i was unable to quothackquot making it impossible to get some ammunition i needed
in another level i was unable to open a hatch as a result of a bug
nevertheless i got through these levels using cheat codes so all was not lostaliens versus predator ii is a really cool well designed game that takes you away so to speak
it includes innovations that work very well and make the game fun to play
if youre a shooter fanespecially a fan of the sciencefiction themed shootersthen give this game a tryaliens versus predator  is actually a game that has really great graphics that is much comparable to that of no one lives forever
i really believed there would not be a game with the same fun ai intelligence and gameplay w great graphics as no one lives forever but i see that i was wrong
aliens versus predator  almost made me forget about all the other games i had on my pc believe me  i have alot of pc games
the graphics are just so detailed and amazing  it just blows away the first aliens versus predator game
the sound is great and the shrieking of the aliens when they are hurt sounds much like that of the aliens in the aliens movie series
the game is very dark and the night vision and flashlight turn off because of battery drain after one minute
the game is not as scary as the first but it does have the feel and look of the aliens and predator movies
the marines do not really look like the same marines from the aliens movies  they appear to look like the operatives in halflife that sport orange jump suits and goggles
the weapons are great  you have a sniper rifle now and the minigun can be used even when you are running
the only problem i had with this game was that it would crash the computer most of the time when you try to quit the game
this is one of the main reasons of why i gave this game  stars instead of  i do not know why the crashes would happen  i tried it on  computer systems a pc with pentium   ghz mb sdram and a nvidia geforce  mb video card and a pc with pentium ii dual  mhz processor  gig sdram and dlabs oxygen vx video card maybe the crash is a temporary bug that could be fixed by downloading new patches from sierra or fox interactives gaming homepage
even so sometimes the graphics would get scrambled like for instances where you could see through the polygons
other than these two problems that i have encountered this game is a must buygameplay  graphics  sound  value  youve read the comics
youve seen the movies
youve played the first avp
now be prepared to be blown away by the second installment of what may turn out to be a longlived fps series on the pc
however not all is gold and silver in this amazing packagethe graphics for one thing are absolutely gorgeous
the characters come to life seamlessly and behave realistically
going for more of a comic book theme avps graphics do not opt for the fleshy and realistic looking models and skins of the first game but instead go for a more colored and polished look similair to what you will find in the classic dark horse comic book series
and thats not a bad thing at all
the characters all have personality and contrary to the first game there is a linear actual story running continuous among all three racesso its not playing the same story with a different outcome its playing the same story through the eyes of each different race as it unfolds
whats that you ask
why did that guy suddenly disappear from the marine campaign
well once youre finished with that youll play the pred or alien campaign and find out
consistencies like that occur through all three viewpoints which adds alot to replay and overall fun valuethese gorgeous graphics described mask a menacebugs and lag
even on some of the most high end to midlevel computers avp has a tendency to be herkyjerky when there is alot of action on screen particularly during mass alien attacks
the graphics manage to stay crisp but the high detail on the models still creates a problem
its okyou can always turn down the display settings but in such a great looking game like this would you really want tocrashes are abundantits too bad really
this is such a great game and yet there are so many wrongs that could have easily been overlooked by the development and playtest teams
crashes during ingame cutsceneswhich are done rather wellconveying the story intelligently and clearly happen often depending on whether or not your video drivers are up to date or if your hardware is compatible
there are many technical issues with the game that can be easily and shuold be solved in a patch or twothe sound is great but there are alot of sounds ripped directly from the movies that were included in avp that were so great and are now missing in avp
one thing that many have wanted is the improved sound on the predators shoulder cannonit sounds exactly as it did in the movies
other sounds have been pulled from the flicks and integrated but many of the sounds have been changed
in any case the sfx are still great and the music ranges from all out creepy to terrifying especially in the marine campaignthe atmosphere is frighteninguse of dark and light is great and keeps the mood forever tense
there are tons of scripted events that will have your knees knocking from utter fear especially in the marine missionsmultiplayer codingit needs serious work
there is a very highly argued balancing issue between the  sides you can choose alien predator uscm corporate mercs each with  subclasses
very buggy and unbalanced the multiplayer game is fun but needs serious work
there is no shortage of interesting modes however and trying them all out will be a blastall in all a great game with some moderate flaws
definitely pick it up if you are looking for a great single player experience or are a fan of avpthis game is definitely an upgrade from the original aliens vs predator pc game
im not talking just graphics game engine sound etc im also talking plot atmosphere action
the game has cutscenes dialogues that can be overheard all these help contour the scenario
theres even a few interesting twists in the plot along the waythis game is definitely worth buyingwow avp
and what great timing
we all know that alien is the best scifi movie ever right
well actually most people think it is aliens the sequel to alien i still think alien is the best
anyways if you are a fan of scifi espically alien buy this game
it will scare you to no end
playing the demo in a dark room with headphones or an a sweet soundsystem will make you scream as soon as something happens either on screen or off
the suspense is almost too much
but then the game does have its problems
if you have an ati card the game doesnt run like it will on an nvidia they say it is resolved in the full version but i still see some traces of it
the second is the alien animations
ugh not as good as the original if you ask me
but problems aside this game rocks
simply excellent
if you are a fan of aliens buy it
if you love scifi buy it
if you like bursting out of peoples chests 
 buy it
no game has given me the sense of suspense like thisin avp you play your choice of alien warrior marine or predator in a single plot that unifies all three
if youve read any of the dark horse alien comics the plot wont surprise you  a covert corporate talk about redundancy conspiracy on a remote and hostile looking planet is breeding xenomorphs the aliens for research purposes
the planet is also home to artifacts related to navigator civilization the longdead alien creatures in whose derelict ship the alien eggs were discovered in the first and second movies and apparently the hunting ground for predators the vicious race of aliens who live for the hunt
something of course goes wrong and contact between earth and the planet is cut
a squad of undermanned and under armed colonial marines is dispatched to investigate
as the lowly harrison you are assigned to a squad but keep getting cut off or otherwise sent alone you wanna stick around and guard the dropship while i grab the glory
be my guest
as you land on lv
instead of something simple like a downed transmitter you find the planet and its research center crawling with aliens and prowled by something else the predator kills people and blasts things near you early on the game but doesnt really put in an appearance those whove seen his movies will recognize the sounds he makes throughout the game
surviving a few early missions in alieninfested parts of the weylandyutani research base you link up with the researchers themselves  only to be betrayed by them
in the best part of the game you are trapped alone and almost entirely defenseless inside of the wy base
you wouldnt have a prayer but you do get some surprising help
the lesson of the game is simple  you can only survive as long as you can turn your enemies against each other or otherwise exploit his gaps of attention guards will overlook your presence  once they are stuck in a room full of hopping facehuggers even predators will cut you some slackas long as there are alien warriors aplentythe game models the look and sound of aliens very well and fans of the colonial marines will rejoice at getting  chance to play with their gear  youve got semiautomatic pistols surprisingly useful pulse rifles smart guns and sniperrifles youve got flamethrowers multipurpose grenade launchers and exomechanical powerloader suits
youve got everything that bill paxton had but the tactical nukes and really big sticks
if they tossed in james horners soundtrack youd swear you were in aliens
some parts of the wy base are actually great renderings of nostromo from the first alien movie
this game is hard  aliens are quick they can run on walls and ceilings and typically attack in force
youve got a motion tracker but it typically wont pick up movement until its almost too late
most of the time youll be laying down a suppressing fire while egressing  ie
running backwards as possible only in fps games while shooting madly at the mass of hostiles behind you
the aliens dont have it any easier  they have no standoff weapons and have to wait for some unlucky sod to enter their darkened lair unawares though they can get health powerups whenever they want simply by chewing up their victims
ironically your most relentless enemy isnt the alien as much as lvs ceaseless darkness
your equipped with either a helmetmounted flashlight or nightvision goggles that sap your batteries dry youll spend a lot of time just waiting for them to rechargethat said the game runs on a very tight storyline  its the only way to keep the game from degenerating into a single uninterrupted frag
when you cant be sure what specific goals are the game tends to lag
also the stiff plot means that theres little point to really exploring avps rather wellrendered settings
forget about those ventilation shafts  just jump out that window  you dont know whats out there but that window is there for some reason
also because the game is difficult youll often have to replay the same stretch of a mission over and over
also too many problems involve simple things like walking on top of some boxes or jumping from an elevator thats being overrun by aliens
while i probably wouldnt handle real aliens as well as the marines in this game im pretty sure i could walk a ledge a lot better than my character doesi played this game on my winxp p ghz geforce and it ran smooth with no sound or graphics issues
if youve conquered other fps games and need a new challenge that doesnt involve multiplayer death matches this is your gamefirst a couple of caveats  i never played the st avp and only really played the marine portion of this one
i started and plan to  get into the aliens part but have no interest in predator at all  i know im alone but the predator franchise wouldnt be able to hold a candle to any of the aliens flicks if not for the vastly uninspired alien resurection  and yes im including alien
the respective themes of alien and predator dont match and putting the two together only blunts the nuance that the first  alien movies for commercial purposes
also monster teamups have a proven trend of destroying great movie franchises  remember all of those frankenstein meets the wolfman movies
we know what happened next  they all met abbot and costello and that was the end of it
whats next  aliens v predator v jim carrey
but i digressthis is a fantastic gamealien and predator is the bestscrew the marine damnit sure its easier but the alien and predator rockget this game its more than worthitthis game is far more frightening and tense than most movies at least playing as marines
from the start of the game it scared the  out of me
there are tons of scripted events in teh begining all as frightening  as teh one before it
youll constantly be looking over your shoulder for more enemys
however i have a small gripe about its scariness the first alien you encounter takes much of the fear away because they are extremly easy to kill taking away some of the atmosphere the movies created
however the atmosphere itself is just plain down freakyeach species human alien and predator have their own strenths and weaknesses but i believe he human is the only really scary one which is what this game is about
however each species is fun to play as
recommended for those that want scared or a different fps experiencecmon
explain to me how im supposed to say a word against this game
its freakin castlevania
as such fans of the series have probably long since bought this and played it to death so i would like to speak here to those of you who know not of the castlevanias of old
if you cant be bothered to do the truly right thing purchase a stack of orphaned systems and play the four or five castlevanias every selfrespecting gamer ought to have enjoyed grab chronicles at its bargain price and find out what you were missing while you were still belting your kindergarten classmates upside the head
hopefully my optimism holds true and a good game is indeed eternalthis contains one of the earliest castlevania games from a japanese computer called the msx something or other the same computer the original  metal gear games were made on and its bit psx remake
the play control is tight and the difficulty is as much a terror as the creatures you fight in this classic seriesdespite its title one would expect more games in the series to be included on the disclike the nes and snes originals for cryin out loud
it only contains the obscure original and remakeif you were weaned on challenging d sidescrolling action in the s this game is for youthe first castlevania game i ever played was iv on the snes back in  i became a fan and even went as far as buying an old nes to just play the first three
as fun as the new castlevania los and the d ps releases are ill always have a special affinity for the retro d classicscastlevania chronicles takes elements from i iii and iv to present entertaining albeit slightly outdated gameplay graphics and sound
i say outdated considering castlevania iv came out in  on the snes with simon able to whip in  directions and swing over chasms along with some very creative levels which utilized the snes scaling fx chip
chronicles came out two years later in  yet simon can only whip in  directions horizontal downhorizontal and straight down and there is no swinging ability
the graphics also took a step backwards yet nothing too drastic
even with enhanced graphics via the arranged mode iv looks and plays better
i figure its due to chronicles originally being released on a system that did not have the same capabilities as the snes so the discrepancies are forgivable
its just too bad the konami didnt beef it up with more than just a few improvements in the graphics and music for the psx release in still this game should be a part of every castlevania fans library if not of every retro gamers
the graphics are not too much of an eyesore the music is great and the gameplay is fantastically fun
there is a great variety of enemies to battle and the levels have that classic castlevania creativity
ive read some reviews that it is a more difficult game
but if youre a castlevania vet its nothing you cant handle
even in hard mode id say it has about the same difficulty as dracula xthe main issue people take with castlevania chronicles is that its old
well its actually the newest cdrom format castlevania game to date besides the castlevania and contra collection
har har very funny
despite the new packaging though it is indeed a game released in  for a system that very few people outside of japan own the sharp x series computer
it is not just any old game though it is generally acknowledged by gamers inside japan as game of the year for that systemthere are two basic modes for the game original and advanced nevermind that an interview with the developer igarashi is included here in the us and european pal version but not in the japanese release from a short while before oursoriginal is just what you expected it to be until i change gears assume im talking only about original mode
the game plays just as it did on the original system with the same graphics three different midi soundtracks each with their own uh style and the same incredibly challenging difficulty
the difficulty in original mode approaches or even surpasses that of super ghouls n ghostsi havent gotten past level  in the original game without some serious use of ahem some serious savestates
on the plus side the game saves after each level so you dont have to go over it againthese graphics are extremely good for the era
the sharp x series had arcadeperfect translations of many classic arcade games from alien syndrome to strider and beyond so if youre a fan of that eras graphics you should certainly at least look up some screenshots
there is a good deal of original music herea really funky remix of castlevanias stage  music vampire killer follows the great intro cutscene something loopy as a great name entry tune and then the new stuff
completely new compositions mixed in with older tunes are found here we see thrashard in the cave seen as it was originally spelt crazy people a really moody piece creatures in the depth for boss music tower of gears moon fight the tower of dolls and etude for the killer are seen for the first time
its not every day you get to see wiched child again sic in the sound test but be assured this is an excellent and moody rendition of the songnow arranged mode improves dramatically on the music for the most part at the cost of introducing a lot of noise
there is now an increased use of reverb and true instruments but here we also see some excessive use of twinkly little sounds and other musical tomfoolery as well
the noise and sometimes overbearingly dramatic style of the remixes may drive you off at first
overall its a lot less pleasant on the ears than the original midi music but regardless of volume shifts you may get used to itmake sure you get to the last level in arrange mode though
the final boss music is among the best reworking of an original castlevania score seen yet
getting there shouldnt be too hard either thanks to the improved difficulty level and different difficulty levelsthere are a couple dramatic reworkings of the games design howeverthe original game had a brownshaded simon in keeping with the visual style of the original games and dracula looked right out of an old s universal picture
in this game these character designs have been reworked by castlevanias current character artist ayami kojimaa bit too serious and odd looking for my taste especially with simons apparently pink hair ingame the cover art shows him with very red hair as you see here in the games iconbefore he bleached it apparentlyalso the original game was played on a square screen
when this is emulated people seem to try to stretch it out to a rectanglerather fat looking characters result
from the screenshots ive seen of chronicles this same problem is evidentthat said chronicles originally was a steal
if youre into collecting be assured that this game will eventually command high prices thanks to the limited run
if you just want to play one of the last oldschool castlevania games i cant think of a better place to look
yes even with loi out i still say thatkinetica is essentially ssx or the upcoming ssx tricky using exotic futuristic locales
the graphics are crisp the worlds are massive and the competition is fierce
with nine potential racers of varying abilities and more than a dozen race circuits the unlockable features ensure longlasting playability
the controls are easy to learn but control is challenging to masterinterestingly the kinetica game manual is extremely welldesigned being both informative and beautiful to look at
the racers and circuits are presented along the bottom of the pages across the entire manual while the specific easytoread details of the game controls options etc
are explained on specific pages
an added bonus is quotthe art of kineticaquot a small booklet presenting closeup images of the games charactersperhaps most impressive is the incredibly fast load time for each race venue
the expansive worlds and their glorious detail take almost no time at all to load this is made to seem even shorter as the game screen offers a tip to improve a palyers performance while the venue loads
another wonderful aspect is that the fastpaced gameplay is not interrupted by dropped frames the only potential drawback is the lack of a specific stunt track andor interactive stunt tutorial such as is available in ssx
this would be a great benefit to players as they first play the game especially since stunts must be performed almost continuously to have a chance at winning
nonetheless while this is not a gran turismo  kinetica is definitely a wonderful game which should definitely be a part of every serious ps gamers collectionat first i did not like it but after the first few races it grew on me like a vine
this race is crazy zainy and just plane funthe first time playing kinetica a few years ago i mus admit i didnt like it
back then i found it difficult but i soon realized that the only reason i found it so difficult was because i had little to no expierience in racing games
i waited i played the need for speed series and i picked this game up again
now that i have more expierience this game is an adrenaline filled rollercoasterthe game feastures full body suits that have wheels on the hand and feet which race you through a futuristic worlds of ups and downs
through the entire expierience you are never completely sure which way is up since you are constantly shooting up and along side wallsthe best feature of the game is the boost system which ties directly to the trick system
doing tricks is an amazong display of twists turn and lights
you can do flips spins both at the same time and many other arial acrobatic tricks
after preforming these great acrobatic feats you earn boos which makes you move much fasterso you may say why not a four star rating
there is only one gripe i have about this game and it is a problem that can be the ultimate downfall of many games
the game is just too short iwas able to beat it in a solid two hours of gameplay which is a less than inspiring statisticif kinetica would have been made just a bit longer i think it would have been a five star game
thats not to say that the short time you are playing is not exciting quite the opposite actually
if you have a lot of freind who cant get enough racing games then this is the perfect multiplayer delight and the game is even fun repeating the career several times well worth the measley  to  dollars for the speed nutgraphics nothing too special what there is will mostly just keep the people watching entertained since the players will be transfixed by the game play
actually this is a game that is tough on the eyes of the players since blinking is actually difficult on many of the songs
if you liked the graphics of whipeout or tempest these will be right up you alleygameplay you use the dpad  buttons and sometimes the left analog stick
mostly you use  buttons to press in time with the beat
by doing this you lay down one of  tracks drum track guitar track vocal track for example
once you get it right for a while it continues to play without you freeing you to move on to the next track
by completeing all the tracks you make the song sound how it was intended to
it is very addictive and the quality of the music helps it be outstanding
remix mode and multiplayer add to the replayability of the title
it also scores high for originality since it is different from anything else out theresound  id have to say this game has the best soundtrack of any game out at this point
the entire game was built around the music and if you dont like the jungle brothers no doubt paul okenfeld lo fidelity all stars or powerman  one of the other  or so artist will probably suit you finedifficulty  the game is actually pretty tough but has an excellent tutorial
id say it falls into the easy to learn hard to master area of gamesconclusion  buyers who enjoy puzzle games this plays like one or music as well as those just looking for something different will be plenty impressed by this title
its only drawbacks are a tough difficulty level and the whole dry eye problem
this is a great leeper title that may get lost in the fray of metal gear solid and gran tourismo but it is a game that is worth adding to a collection and is easily the best music game for the psive never been a fan of rhythm type games but i checked this one out because i liked the music that came with it
it took about one hour for me to get used to the gameplay and objectives but since then ive been hookedgraphics the psychedelic background actually can get in the way of the gameplay because you get so distracted by it
fortunately there is a track without all the colorful shapes and imagesgameplay there are three difficulty settings
most people should not have any trouble with easy settings
it may take couple of hours to get the hang of normal setting
i have yet to start on expert mode
the challenge is to get the high score and unlock a new song for each roundsound great
most of the time youre so focused on collecting the jewels that you wont realize what instrument youre on but everything sounds greatthe good great song selection simple yet challenging gameplay remix mode is funthe bad visuals can give you a headache not enough songs can get extremely hard later onbefore guitar hero and rock band harmonix created this fun rhythm game using pop hiphop industrial rock and other genres
you tap away on your controller with a pick your own path type of gameplay
the game is fun and very challenging and comes with some great toolsyou use the square circle and triangle buttons to tap away on a track
use the dpad to rotate the tube and pick any track you want to play
you will know when you have to play when you see a green line connecting dots
this gives you a break between sections so you can rest your thumb for a second
tracks range from the vocals synth bass drums guitar and other instruments
when you successfully complete a section that instrument will continue playing
score perfectly in that section of the song and the instruments wont turn off when you enter the next gate
i found this a little annoying but it encourages you to play perfectly the song doesnt stop
you are scored as usual and a meter is shown on how bad or well you are doing
fail too much and you will fail the songthats the entire game in a nutshell
it seems simple and it is but the game is challenging later on when you have to do longer sections and faster button presses
theres some pretty good music here by powerman  no doubt fear factory and others popular musicians
the visuals are trippy and can give you a headache after a while
they are psychedelic and full of bright colors and fractal shapes
one thing i found useless was the free scratch mode which lets you press one of the three buttons while moving the left stick back and forth to scratch
this isnt there for anything but for fun i guessonce you beat the main game on each difficulty you can go into remix mode which plays a song while you add your own notes to the song
this can be pretty fun for people who want to changeup the game themselves
however i did find that there should have been more songs but i guess remix mode is supposed to remedy that
theres a good dozen hours of gameplay here and you will keep coming back to master the gamefor just a couple of dollars frequency is one of the most fun i have had in a rhythm game since rock band  i found myself coming back and trying to master the songs
the music may not be to everyones taste but if you open your mind you will find a gem of a game heresure it may be little more than a hybrid of crash bandicoot and super mario  but it has extremely polished gameplay and loveable characters jak the mute spikyhaired hero daxter the motormouthed furball samos the old and crotchety yodaesque sage and his hot and intelligent daughter kiera
much of the gameplay consists of collect x number of bronze eggspower cells with some hoverbike action and a few minigames in between but its still darn fun
all the levels consist of one giant seamless world with gameplay ranging from the ridiculously easy senitel beach geyser rock to the unbelievably challenging spider cave anyone
my favorite level is the atlantisesque precursor city
its extremely fun to play although the game could use a few more boss fightsthe only flaw in jak and daxter is the completely unoriginal plot
it doesnt affect the gameplay but it must have taken the guys at naughty dog about  minutes to come up with the story for jd
  here it is jd explore a forbidden island that must have been inspired by the elephant graveyard in the lion king and daxter falls into a pit of dark evil stuff and is transformed into an otterweasel hybrid an ottsel ooh how original
the entire game revolves around the pair journeying north to find the only guy who can change daxter back who of course turns out to be a bad guy
along the way they must fight off enemies called lurkers again how original
and interact with artifacts from a lost people called the precursors cant we be more creative than that
but overall jd is an almost perfect platformer
jak  and  are superior and much more complex and adultoriented but that just makes jak  that much more oneofakindchad steingraberparadigminfogrameslevel designergame designerd artist on the terminator dawn of fatethis is one of those games that i had fun playing through the entire game
there were a few moments of complete frustration where i had to put it down and come back the next daybut it was worth it
i didnt find anything to be repeatative or boring
it brought me back to when i first bought a dreamcast and played rayman   i would definately suggest this game to anyone who likes actionadventureplatform styles gamesits a lot of fun
i gave it four stars because of some of the frustration i encounted
more than just a rental this game will take you a little while unless you play it all weekend or can rent it for  daysthen its a rental
unless you are crazy insane for this game you will only need to play it once
i traded mine in for drakan after i was donethis classic is sure to entertain your kids for many hours
there are many different worlds to explore that are all brilliant and full of color
you are jak a young boy and your partner daxter has been turned into a weasel
you have to explore vast world and obtain enough power cells in order to move on to the next worlds
you must complete different tasks in order to obtain these power cells
for example you must heard cows into a pen and catch a certain amount of fish with a net in another section
these are just two examples of fun mini games that you must play in order to progress thru the game
if you are looking for a fun game for kids without the foul language or violence then look no furtheri saw lots of commercials game previews and demos on this game and all had nothing but good things to show about this game
after playing a demo on this game i knew i had to get it
it seemed really good and when i finally got it i was hooked
this game has a good story awesome and beautiful graphics and the characters are great
daxter was funny samos hagaigreen sage was funny and cool and jak was badasseven though he never spoke in the entire game
i really do hope that naughtydogwho really rocks at making games makes a sequel to this game it really does deserve and need one
the ending definitely leaves you hanging and wanting to know quotwhats behind that freakin door
quot another reason why they should make a sequel is because of the villains gol and maia akaron
they make it pretty obvious that there was a chance the two villains survived falling into the dark eco siloand ill bet that falling into the dark eco like that will make them even more powerful
quotjak and daxter the precursor legacyquot is definitely a must have if youre into make believe stuff with elves monsters adventureand danger
get it or rent it its your choiceunlike many adventure games this one doesnt make you watch the whole thing
it does have its share of cutscences but most of the time you get to run around in a free environment
they keep the edge of the game world away from you nice to
it has a good story and its quite long and keeps you interested by always introducing new charaters and the levels are hugeonly problems i see is the life scale is made up weird must collect  green things to get another peice of life
but its not much concern as since the late s all adventure games you have unlimited deaths
there are some anoying d jumping as always but the l analong control is nicely used to move the camera whereever you want around yourselfall and all its a fun game if you like doofy adventure games has some funny stuff and some anoying stuffthis game was a lot of fun
it reminded me of ratchet  clank amazing game only without the guns and gadgets and set in a mystical world
the world is this huge multi level world and is really well put together
it could have done with more weapons thoughthis game is so much fun theres lots to collect tons to do an interesting story different gameplays and an amazing world to explore
this just the beginning of a crazy story thats posed as a platformer racer and puzzle solving
the bosses are epic and powers are tricky
this game has it all or almost but the sequels make up for anything missing
must have to start of this epic taleremember all the time you wasted playing mario bros on your nintendo
live those days all over again with jak amp daxter
only now do it in an amazingly rendered d world of beaches jungles swamps icy mountains and fiery cavern depthsthe first thing i noticed in the game were these absolutely beautiful graphics
insects buzz around the wind moves through the trees and everything behaves naturally enough to pass as a real cartoonish environment
having never played a naughty dog title before i was stunned by the attention to graphic detail like jaks feet kicking up sand as he runs along the beach
the graphics associated with the powerups are also very well done
i really cannot give too much praise to the games artistic design
the spatiallyoriented sound helps provide for excellent immersionthe gameplay remains nothing new
collect doodads collect some doodads to get other doodads finish little side quests to get doodads all while donig some sort of puzzle solving
sure theres tons of platform jumping an old saw of the actionadventure genre
it wont matter when its done as well as this thoughmy only complaint and its a small one was with the story nonexistent amp characters onedimensional amp thus dull which has always been a problem with this genre so one gets used to it
also one thought i had was that it would have been neat to have had a chance to use daxter the crittersidekick on jaks shoulder alone in a couple of sections
as it is hes just along for the ride amp for color commentaryamazing find great price cute characters and story line
love easy controls and tutorial
fun for all ages
cute storylinefrom the creators of crash bandicoot comes jak and daxter
the games overall feeling is a good one
with a very well designed environment it sucks you right injak your quiet hero player and protagonist and his buddy daxter are quite the duo
when daxter falls into dark eco he is turned into a ottseland from that point jak sets out to find the one person who can possibly turn his friend back into a human
which basically covers the plotwith many traps and puzzles this game requires thinking and strategy as well as fighting technique which balances out very welloverall this game is entertaining for a while but will get old
nevertheless it is a great start to a great franchise
however the fact jak doesnt talk can get annoying sometimes
but it is fixed in later games of coursegreat buyeven though this is an old title the graphics are very good for a ps game and the gameplay is solid
dont have much to add since most other reviews state everything in detail so i would just recommend this to anyone who hasnt played it yetthis game is platforming done right
huge sprawling levels filled with tons of intricate detail and no loading almost
on top of that a blast to play with very little bad to say about it
gameplay is well refined and a little borrowed from their past crash games
is the game too short
no
about  hours of solid gameplay
why i said it was over way too soon is because once you get to the end of the game you are left really wanting more
the only teenytiny draw back are those ugly ps jaggies they dont hinder your gaming experience but when you step back to take in the amazing detail you seem em crawling around everything
a great game nothelessi love platform games but not many are out there
i tried crash bandicoot and i just didnt like it
im not sure which one it was or anythingso being a spyro fan looking for a fun yet playable game i rented thisit looks really good and it plays well the characters are good dax is cute
 but i lost interest when i got stuck
not having a strategy guide i wandered and i think the problem is that it gave you too much area to explore at once and that made it easy to get lost
i never bought it and i havent tried the second one
it sounds less cute and more battlelike and hard
but when i have some time i might buy this game and play it througha great step up for platform games thoughthis is a great game and i reccomend it for any body
i really had fun playing it
the graphics are awesome
jak is cool
and so is daxter
this is the best e rated game out there
see yai got this game for my son and he loves it
he had some trouble with it at certain points but overall its a good game for anyone looking to revive their pss playabilityjak and daxter is by far the best platform game out for any of the next generation systems right now
the gameplay is very similar to that of naughty dogs crash bandicoot games
the graphics are excellent and there is plenty of places to explore and things to collect
after collecting my first  orbs in jak and daxter  i must admit that this is one of the coolest games i have played in a while
wait until you try to get over the lava canyon or have to catch the fish you old school gamers may remember the atari  game kaboom its very similar even though its only for a short time unless you stink at it  this is truly cool stuff
the sound is typical naughty dog fair and doesnt really add to or take away anything from the game
at one point i could of sworn that it was the same music from crash bandicootthe saving feature in jak and daxter is great it saves you the frustration of having to restart the level when you die
this is great because the levels are huge and it makes the game much easier to playoverall i like this game a lot its a great looking game and its a blast to play
i can see naughty dog using jak  daxter as their next platform game  of which many sequels will be madeand yet another great game for the ps
eat your heart outxboxthe camera
it will drive you nuts
other than the camera having a mind of its own and doing things that i hated the game is great
have fun playing itmy  year old got this game for christmas and he loves it
so far he has made it through most of the levels on his own and only needed help with a few of them
we are only about half way through the game now
i must say i love the game as well from what i have played so far its a great game
definately worth the moneyi had the demo and wasnt very fond of it
i enjoyed ratchet and clank a million times more
so i would say you should skip this one unless you really like platformersthis is probably one of the greatest platform games of all time
of course that doesnt say much since platform games arent truly the greatest games
the graphics are very good though a little garish
the frustration level is not truly a problem
the most important aspect is the openness of such a game
you could move from the level to level with ease
if youre stuck at one place just move onto a different place
the constraints of a standard platform game are absentbasically jak and daxter travel through different areas beaches volcanoes caves villages and try to pick up power cells
you can gain power cells through accomplishing many different task from finding certain crates destroying certain creatures to minigames and on and on
you travel by foot travel in a sort of hover bike or in one instance ride a small bird like creaturethe controls are pretty intuitive and the camera angles are right on
you cant save at any point in the game but the saving takes place in very frequent spots
this saves the user from repeating many jumps and actions
sometimes jumping is a little cheap and frustrating but no one is asking for perfectionthe bad part is that it just is a platform game
even though the exploration part is nice its basically a series of jumps for most of the game
it even falls to the same cliched trap of fighting some super boss at the endprosgood graphicsintuitivevery little in terms of cut sceneswide openlittle repetitionconsjust a platform gametime  hoursfrustration lowdifficulty lowthis game is fun for all ages and has excellent graphics
it has some funny characters mainly daxter and is a quotgreatest hitsquot game
the game is about how daxter transforms into a muskrat by falling into a pool filled with quotdark ecoquot he decides to set off on a journey with jak in search of a cure for his transformation
the game is an actionadventureplatform type
you jak must complete different tasks to receive power cells that help aid your quest
the moves that jak can perform are pretty neat
there are the basic jumps punches kick spinsstuff like that and then there are the uppercuts rolling turbo jump dive attack and the aerial attack
i thought that the only bad thing about the game was that it was too short
i finished the game in about  weeks couple hours a day
i just hope that the sequel will be much longer
overall i recommend this game to anyone that likes to play adventureplatform gamesthis game was great for its time but weve kind of moved on since then
it definitely feels like a game from the early days of the ps
the game play is very retro
to give you an example you spend a lot of the time picking up precursor orbs which are more or less the golden rings in sonic or the golden coins in super mario
you have to collect many many many of these to get power cells which then let you go to other parts of the mapthe attacks are rather simplistic and you dont have a wide variety
thats not to say gameplay is not fun but it relies a little too much on taking only a couple of hits or doing a speed run on a vehicle perfectly for my tastes
a lot of time is spent memorizing obstacles dying starting up again then getting further dying restarting and finally succeeding
i really enjoyed it but ive liked more recent ps titles more
the games cheap now and if youre going to play the other jak games you probably want to play this one just to see the start of the story
decent gamethe title says it all
this game is a fun actionpacked adventure that brings the animated series to life on your tv
this game promises to look and play better on gamecube than on other systems because it runs at a constant  fps frames per second which makes the animation appear smoother
the developers also added some extra graphics effects that werent possible on xbox or ps such as volumetric more realistic fog and smoke
this game will not disappoint batman fansbatman vengeance has made history
the best of all the batman games put together
the second best superhero game next to spiderman and spidermanenter electro
the plot twists in the game were very well put together
the only downside is the horrible control
for example right when youre going to jump from a building to another is impossible
than of course comes the satisfying kersplat when he comes face to concrect
the joker no surprise is the head honco for the game
hopefully the next sequel will fix this problem and have another excellent plot along with the camerabatman vengeance is a really good game not great but really good
however the method for saving a game in progress is the worst
you have to quit the game and then save it
i have not played any game that had that kind of idiotic save method before
no automatic saving in this game
i had played this game the first day i got it for like six hours straight which is a lot for me because i am a busy man and it was extremely fun and exciting because of the great story sound effects and brilliant cutscenes
if you are a fan of the animated batman series then this game is for you
a lot of interesting twists in story occur throughout this game which i figured out from the beginning but still wanted to play through the game to see them unfold
the battle against the joker is nothing short of spectacular even though it was quick and easy
while batmans skills in fisticuffs is okay and a bit sluggish at times and controls for cuffing people is somewhat troublesome and glitchy the controls for using his weapons and utilities are quite good
the fights are still fun and somewhat fun to watch while jumping from rooftop to rooftop and down ladders is fantastic
note i beat this game the third day i got it
the only reason why it took three days is because of the bizarre save mechanism
i had to play through the entire game all over on the third day for about  hours or so
the way the joker behaves in this game is delightful because his behavior is a good match for him
the cut scenes in this game are fantastic but it is a short game with really close to nothing to replay it for except a second run through of the storybatman vengeance is a fun action game that keeps you enjoying every moment all the way through the game
honestly im not one to like batman but this game was so much fun
when this game first came out it was actually a lot of fun
i really wanted a good actionadventure game to play and what better than a batman game to fulfill this need
ive never watched the batman animated series but i hear that the game is loosely based on those
its got a very dark comic book look
the graphics are very hard to judge because of the art direction it takes
they dont look bad in any sense they are just very comic booky
i actually really enjoyed the look of the game
lets just say they arent realistic in any waythe gameplay is also really good
although the game takes a very go from point a to b type of style it is still so much fun
throughout the game you will encounter some of the most popular batman bad guys from poison ivy to doctor freeze and of course the joker
they all make a great contribution to the game
most of the game is played through a rd person perspective
when in this perspective you can do pretty much everything except use your special gadgets and battoys
in that case you go into a st person mode
my favorite of the gadgets is probably the batarangs they are so much fun
one small gripe about these gadgets is you cannot use them while staying in rd person
when you use any of them the game automatically takes you into st person mode which can feel pretty clunky and confusing at times
if you are in close combat however you can stay in rd person mode and fight with good old punches and kicks
the fighting in this game was put together very well and felt very authenticoverall this game was very good especially for a game that came out in  it had a very unique art style that i liked a lot even though it didnt truly show the power of the xbox
it was definitely worth playing a little short but still very goodi have liked batman since i was a kid
this game seemed stupid when i heard it was batman yes i grew out of that phase but when i actually got to play the game it actually had alot of cool features
the batmans movement is really cool the cutscenes are great however their mouth doesnt move can be ignored
sound gives you the feeling of the old batman cartoon again
storyline is basically the batman cartoon that was on tv
missions are sometimes a bit difficult because of camera angle but overall brings the thrill
i would recommend this because this is actually the best batman game around that stuck to the original batman storyline on tv and it is actually playable
although there are rooms for improvement this game is great and better than any other titles out there so if you are a batman fan this is itsound replay value gameplay graphics story overall i must say that i am mostly impressed
this game is the first batman video game ive ever played that i enjoyed the others quite frankly were awful
the graphics are great the movement is very fluid and the animated sequences are fantastic
they developed no shortage of moves for batman such as gliding with his cape or hiding in shadows against the wallthe problem is that the game can be very frustrating at certain points due to the limitations in control
it would have worked much better if its controls were more like halo and max payne in which you move with one thumbstick and control the viewpoint with the other
here batmans perspective is limited and you constantly have to press the trigger button when you want to look in the direction that batman is facingthe fight scenes are good as are batmans martial arts moves but there are certain parts where it is very awkward and frustrating to maneuver him
the biggest example of this is when fighting poison ivys minions handtohand the very slight delay between pressing the button and the execution of the move is just long enough for the plant guys to knock you on your butthaving batman use the grapple is neat but very limited you use the grapple only to certain select spots where they allow you to do it and not to any surface that would likely be able to hold a grappling hook
its not like spiderman which in most ways was obviously batman vengeances biggest inspiration where you can pretty much use the web to attach to whatever you wantthe car and plane chases are lame
theres no other word for them
the detail is scant control is very limited and if you deviate even slightly from the set path you lose and have to restart from the checkpoint
basically its as if the developers spent five minutes working on the vehicle sequencesif you compare this game to trend setters such as playstations spiderman which set the standard for urban superhero games or xboxs halo which has amazing graphics fantastic control and great vehicles batman falls a little short
still for anyone who loved the animated series which i did it is a heck of a lot of fun to interact in gotham city the atmosphere of which the developers flawlessly mirrored for this game
i was very impressed by the graphics and it was so great that they got the original cast from the cartoon to provide the voices herethis game is great fun for simpsons fans  for a little while
after a while it becomes pretty repetitive but still fun
while the real voices are a great addition there are a limited number of them and so hearing the same thing over and over again gets old after a while
another downside is that it can take up to  seconds and usually does to load between games
thats a giant drag
on the upside there are many different vehicles to unlock and drive which makes the game more challenging
some vehicles handle much differently than others
the missions are fun but are easy to beat after only a handful of tries
the game has  levels however so if they werent easy youd never finish the game
despite its drawbacks its the game i play the most out of all of my games
enjoya racetype game in which youre encouraged to run into things
im in
although of course this is not the typical race game
you race to pick up passengers and deliver them to their destination
this game is just plain fun
my husband really likes it for taking out his frustrations
recommendeduhcrazy taxi
more like lazy taxi
hahaha
okay that wasnt funny but the game certainly is
real character voices for everyone and the kind of thing youd expect from the simpsons
some hings are just like the show
its the kind of game that takes some time to beat but lasts forever with a great twoplayer mode
and youve gotta love the other features such as sunday drive playing for fun not for points and quick missions
unquestionably the funniest video game everhididdlyho there
ned flanders at your serviddlyervice
the game starts out with the simpsons watching the news and they find out that homers boss c montgomery burns has bought the bus company and has made the buses radioactive
the citizens of springfield wont stand for it
they are forced to turn their cars into cabs and boycott the buses while collecting money to buy back the bus comnpanythis is one awesome game
if youre a big simpsons fan like me youll love this game
one strange thing about this game is that its just like crazy taxi in every way except there is a primary objective that must be completed to beat the game collect a million dollars to buy back the bus company
you can play with about eighteen characters and play on six levels
as far as game play goes it is awesome
graphics are phenominal and another cool thing is that the characters sound and look just as they do on the show
here are the characters you can play with their cars and best asset are also listedhomer family sedan  all aroundmarge convero  all turningbart soap box racer  accelerationlisa electric car  accelerationgrandpa gocart  speedprofessor frink hover car  best overall my favorite

other than that its perfect
so what are you waiting for
get it nowps
vote quimbyi think the simpsons are awesomei think crazy taxi is fun
combine them and you get a good game
the storyline is good
the game is fun and has excellent replay value
the graphics are not so good
dont listen to the reviews that say this game is horrible
for those who dont like crazy taxi just rent this game
as for those who enjoyed crazy taxi tis is a must buythis game is great
unlock missions and new characters and gain lots of money to buy back springfields transit system from  mr burns
you can also have a player contest
the characters are hilarious
this game like many will entertain you for quite some time but once you get everything done it will probably sit on your shelfthis is a good game to start off with on gamecube
i just got my gamecube and this is the first game i got
i love it
it helps that i am a simpsons fan but i believe that everybody would like this game
even if you just watched maybe  or  episodes
the main part of the game is road rage
the goal is to get  million s
it is really fun because everytime you hit a certain cash goal you win a prize like a new character or a new starting location
the cool thing is you pick
the other cool part of this game is mission mode
there are  in all and at the end you win a certain prizei wont ruin it for u basically there are different missions such as knocking all of the newspaper stands down and then on the th mission you meet mrburns himself
personally i like this game a lot
it does have some similarities to crazy taxi but in simpsons there is actually a way to beat the gamegetting  million 
in crazy taxi there was no way to beat the game
also mission mode has almost nothing in common with taxi
the head to head modemultiplayer is also really fun
you can set the goal to k k or k
for each person you drop off you get k
one of the players picks the person up and tries to get the chararcter to its destination while the other tries to follow the car and smash into it to steal the passenger
its very cool
this game does have some bugs to work out like long loading times but it is all worth it
thats why i give it a   if i could have i wouldve put  and a halfwhat i meant by the title is that my little brother and i did not like this video game as much as hit  run
i give this  stars because the missions in mission mode are too easy and there is only one music track in sunday drive mode
sometimes i have problems with the controllers
i have to use controller  or controller the game only accepts input from one controller at a time
however in road rage mode i do like the safe trip and road rage bonuses and how each character has his or her own unique vehicle
overall i think it was a pretty good video game and is sure to make a promising addition to your simpsons collectionea still knows how to make the best sports games around
ssx tricky is a solid snowboarding title that not only offers fun but long lasting gameplay that will have you coming back for more
awesome graphics like the animations of the players and the snow that showers off your board
cool in action sound effects like taunts and hints uttered throughout your run
interesting props and signs line the course and awesome light effects reflecting off the snow
control wise you coudlnt ask for a more tight responsive feel of you player and board doing tricks helps boost your turbo meter
a great game that gives you an arcade feel and interface highley recommended for snowboarder fans and nonsnowboarder fansjust like i said when you buy this game youll have so much fun with it
but after a month or two itll get extremely boring it has a very low value to it
but it is cheap so you could just buy it for a month or two then sell again
thats what i didyoull have a good old time with this game for only a bit thoughssx tricky is an awesome game personally my nd favorite my all time favorite is super smash bros melee just so you know
i love the game play the graphics are sensational pretty much as lifelike as can be
there is only one thing that separates it from the preqel ssx when your character comes flying off his or her board and does an uber trick a special trick that no one else can perform
the uber trick can be performed once your boost meter is full
pay close attention to the right hand side of the screen
the insane tricks are what makes this game specialas far as the game play goes there are a total of  characters however you start out with the folloing  their age is also listedmac frasierelise riggsmoby jones eddie wachowskibut you can later access  more riders by earning gold medals in the world circut mode note there are two modes of play showoffwhere you earn points by doing tricks or race modewhere you race against other racers
which mode you do it on doesnt matter
the characters trickriding style depends on what board they usealpine boarderboardlongboardfocuses mainly on speedfreestyle boarderboardshortboardfocuses mainly on tricksbx boarderboardmidsized boardfocuses on every areayou also have this thing called a trick book where you do tricks to earn a new outfit
if you mannage to complete the whole trick book you earn an uberboard the best board in the whole gameif i was to rate this game on a scale of  to  id give it an  hey what can i say
im addicted to this gamei got this game  at the store and i can say i am not disappointed
to tell you the truth i dont really like snowboarding games that much
this is the first one i ever bought i played  snowboarding at a friends house
however it was better than i expected but not perfectgraphics the graphics are pretty good
i have seen better in other gamecube games but this will have to dosound this is ssx trickys best attribute
the music was custom made for this game by various artists
after listning for a while during game playi have to say that it is amazing musiccontrol the control is also very nice
turning is easily accomplished and it is easy to perform a trick but hard tricks get much harder to perform
this offers enough challenge for everyonegameplay the game has eight normal coarses that need to be unlocked by winning races in race mode or by getting enough points in showoff mode
there are two extra coarses that when unlocked can only be accessed in practice mode
this is something i do not like too much
speaking of modes there are three main modes
practice world circuit and single race
each can be accessed with one or two players except world circuit
world circuit is the were you can race in competitions and try to unlock more level
in single race you can race against the computer or a friend in one race
in practice mode you can race just for fun by yourself or with a friend
no computers
you can also do trick practice in practice mode
this allows you to try to perform all the tricks in the gamefun factor each of the coarses is a fastpaced race or trick fest to the bottom
ssx tricky is not a realistic game but is more of a no physics at all type of game
even if you are not a major fan of snowboarding i still recommend picking this up
you will not be disappointed
i know i sure wasntif you have ever read any of my reviews you will know the scoring system is alwaysgraphics sound control gameplay fun factor ssx tricky got the following scoresgraphics sound control gameplay fun factor final score  rounds to a this game is very entertaining and has a lot of replay value as it did on ps and xbox
the trix are mad and disobey all laws of gravity and the characters have famous celebrity voices from the likes of lucy liu and david arquette
the easier earlier courses are good but the later ones are just insane
the tricks are quite easy to pull off and the racing action is great toooverall this is a great game as it was on ps but it is slightly inferior to its predecessor which is not what gamcube fans want
the system is more powerful than the ps and i think this title was just rushed to make an early release before making any improvements on the graphics and some of the controls could have been better
great game but next time i hope ea makes a better effort with ports from ps to to gc
but still if u never played it before on ps buy this and quotget trickyquotgo get this game its worth it its fun as hell and the replay is there one of the best games on gamecubessx tricky is a great game in many aspects
the graphics are sweet the course designs are nice the music is catchy and there are quite a few things to unlock
i wish there were more courses and a fourplayer mode would have been nice but overall ssx tricky delivers a solid game experiencessx games are the best snowboarding games ever
why
for starters you can go anywhere you want on your board
ssx is one of the most diverse snowboarding games out there and definately worthy of your attentioni am really glad to see some great soccer on the gamecube
dreamcast and nintendo  editions were not very good so this is easily a pleasent surprise
the shoulder buttons and comfortable controller work great making al controls work really well
the gameplay is alos excellent and it gives the player full control of what is going on in the field
my only complaint is that it can get bland after playng it for a while but it is the best soccer game excluding the upcoming  fifa world cupgreat game but it only allows you to qualify for the world cup from different regions
you dont actually get to play the  world cup itself
also the cameras quotzoomquot and quotdistancequot settings always reset after every game and the interface ie
menus etc
have some rough spots
the music is very quotgerman discoquot but otherwise the game is great and suited to players of different levelsfunfunfun
a very nice game with a fun ring to it
a soccer fan will enjoy it a soccer hater will enjoy itanybody will
fun game buy itgreat grahics after a goaltomshadyyes you can use monsters adapter but i am happy with this one by microsoft
it is only  and has outputs for my component cables as well as an optical output for  dolby digital sound
it comes with some cheap component video cables but it gets the job donepeople may complain that it is not shielded but it honestly did not make a difference for me as i dont have it lying next to any power cords or speakersif you have an hdtv why wouldnt you want the highest quality possiblethe product picture doesnt show everything that comes with this kit
it also includes an svideorca cable that will connect the audio and svideo to your system
what it does not include is the fiberoptic digital audio cable which is a must have if you have a dolby digital av systemi cant tell you how much better the sound is with dolby digital enabled
youve got to hear it to believe itthe only reason i dont give this  stars is that you cant use one of the cheaper coax digital cables but instead have to fork out another  for the fiber optic cablefor those of you that dont know and as ive recently discovered there are a few of you there are a few ways of improving the already exceptional performance of the xbox
the best bang for your buck is the advance av pack which allows you to upgrade from those yellow red and white av cables which are standard for almost all home entertainment equipment to svideo and dolby digitali was originally planning to order the monster component video cables which are far more expensive but offer the very best in performance
eventually i decided to go with svideo instead because my  sony wega has svideo hookups in the front as does my second tv and the televisions of all my friends whose houses i sometimes take my box
when i saw this product on the shelf for half the price of the monster hookups i bought it impulsively and im very pleased with the resultsfor those with very highend equipment hdtv or those willing to shell out a little extra dough theres no substitute for monster
for the rest of us this little setup does the job quite nicely
ive got a decent system  sony wega onkyo receiver and polk speakers and it feels like im finally getting all my money out of my xboxafter playing these game for two months with the standard cables the difference is stunning
the dolby digital sound is immersive and incredible
theres just no comparison
the superior video actually makes some games easier to play
svideo improves the depth clarity and color allowing you to see distant objects clearly which is important when playing halo or gotham racer
you can see creatures clearly or the outlines of an impending turn allowing you better reaction time
a surprising benefit but a welcome onewhile im satisfied with this inexpensive little product theres a few things you should know  if you want dolby digital sound youll need to buy an optical cable seperately
if you can afford hdtv you can definitely afford monster component cables so do yourself a favor and buy them
if youre new to things like svideo and arent sure what they are make sure your tv has at least one svideo inlet
if you have a midrange tv built in the last  years you probably do but know what your tv can do before you buy any of the available wiresnew legends has gotten poor reviews from numerous sites due to its graphics which are not up to par with other xbox titles
this game however offers outstanding gameplay which fans of old school beatemups like final fight will love
this game was developed by infinite machine headed by the designer of the original jedi knight
not surprisingly this game has a lot in common with lucasarts obiwan which happens to use the jedi knight engine
it has the same fun mission based killeveryoneinsight rdperson gameplay but instead of wielding a lightsaber you wield numerous weapons of eastern theme ranging from samurai swords to razor claws to guns
being that you can hold one weapon in each hand you can either spin around slicing opponents as you go or shoot opponents with a gun while at the same time hitting them with a sword attack from your other hand there are two attack buttons one for each hand
though the action in the game is very repetitive like any beatemup the levels are diverse and a blast to play through
the graphics in this game are better than obiwan but more on the level of dreamcast than xbox
in addition you also see subfps framerates at points which also detracts from the graphics
all in all a worthwhile purchase due to its addictive gameplay as long as you can get over the graphicsnew legends is one of the next round xbox games afterinitial launch
the concept of a primitive neofuturistic china is both compelling and immersivethe play style is very similar to obi wan withthe exception that you cannot kill your allies byaccident which is a good thingthe gave is very story line driven and may seemfrustrating in the beginning because you arentgiven a chance to fight the arch villains that arestomping all over your kingdominitially the combat seemed too difficult untili learned to fight with a short sword and long swordmost importantly is the blocking this will stop opponentsin mid attackis it worth the money
i would say yes to thatlet me start by saying i hate most racing sims where its just you against the turns and the gears in a sad attempt to exactly capture the thrills of actual circuit racing
it doesnt work
it neednt work
why do they keep trying
who plays that junk
video games are capable of so much more so why not get a little more fanciful
burnout  makes great use of moving and unpredictable obstacles traffic to produce a firstrate arcade experience unlike anything you could try in real life more than once anyway
sure it has the turning and sliding and manual transmission issues of a quotrealquot racing game but the real fun is in trying to drive against traffic at  mph to build up turbo so you can go even faster
the courses are really wonderful
the action really keeps the heart pounding as in no other game ive playedother racing games i love all ps for some reason  crash team racing  fantastic alone or with friends
sled storm  great use of shortcuts tricks terrain
micro machines  overhead everytoyononescreenreally boring racing games sega gt  rallisport challenge smugglers run multiplayer mode atv offroad fury gtvisually burnout is a superb looking title with solid visuals
they are nextgeneration worthy thats for sure as they feature excellent vehicular detail and great environmental detail
the cars are very well detailed
they are made up of great texture work and feature very nice chroming and lighting reflections in part with the environments
the environments of burnout range from american cities not real ones just by atmosphere to european cities
the craftsmanship is done well for every stage in the game as they do great jobs of resembling their respective countriesperhaps whats most interesting in burnouts visuals is the realtime damage
crashing the vehicles is really half of the fun and when looking at a manually controlled replay you can see that each and every crashs side effect damage to the car has various animation strands
in other words when looking at the direct impact playing a couple of milliseconds of the replay and pausing it again youll see that the car begins to show its damage
the severe dents just dont flash on the vehicle in one animation you can actually see the crunching occur in front of your eyes
the frame rate is crisp and rarely drops from its set point of  even with all of those traffic cars on screen at once
the game does suffer from some flickering and a few aliasing issues but its nothing overwhelming but it is there
while they cant compare to what gran turismo  has set for us and lets face it that wont happen for a while burnout is a solid looking title with a blistering frame rate to bootburnout manages to cast itself as hybrid of test drive and need for speed with a dash of originality
the core of the game revolves around the initially mentioned but the latter comes in as a little emphasis to the racing
burnout is a true arcade racer and theres no doubt about it
unlike nfs and td the game has a counter counting down and refreshing every time you hit a checkpoint
there are many cars to choose from  being the initially available with three different styles of handling
the smaller vehicles are easier to control as they are more nimble
the speedier vehicles while harder to handle are much quicker but handle loosely
the larger vehicles like the pickup are the hardest to manuever but the best when it comes down to muscle on the road
the opposition will try to hit you to oncoming traffic by hitting you from the side although the oncoming traffic will try to swerve out of the way though key word was quottryquot
if an accident happens youll see on the screen what the insurance bill wouldve been due to the outcome of the crash
tally up a high insurance bill in one race and your name will go down in the record books
but on the downside i did feel that after an hour or two of gameplay burnout begins to wear out and slowly become repetitiveyou have to race three laps around one stage and some stages are reasonably long as one lap could add up to  minutes turning a three lap race into a  minute event
what makes it even more grueling are the consequences lets say youre playing a race and leading it throughout the whole time until suddenly you crash at the very end and your opponent passes you and the qualifying position doesnt allow you to settle for second
so now you have to replay those ten minutes of racing on the same track once again only to have it happen once again
now youre utterly frustrated and discouraged and dont want to continue playing the game anymore but maybe you would had the tracks been shorter and this has happened to me once too many
burnout does retain a great sense of speed especially because it runs at  frames per second
to define the sense of speed even more burnout has a little adrenaline gauge that fills up every time you are doing some risky as you drive
if you pass between two vehicles cleanly the meter will go up heavily if you closely pass by a car the meter will increase as well if you drive towards and passed oncoming traffic the speed meter will increase dramatically
my pet peeve with burnout is that you cant explore the games stages nor can you just cruise around and not have to worry about the clock
i feel the game is claustrophobic in terms of offering me any deeming extras hopefully a sequel will improve upon that
altogether burnout is a fun game that can be even more fun when playing with a friendburnouts controls range from slippery to stable mostly because of the different controls the cars have depending on their class
some cars can take quite some time to get used to while others are like gloves and grip the road wonderfully
the analog sticks work great with the game
you can get a good feel for the vehicles using the analog instead of the touchy digital
when crashing the dual shock does a great job at making you feel the impact because of the rumbles power
adjusting to the controls layout should take no time everything is as general as it could possibly get for a racing game that and the right analog stick is compatible for acceleration and braking
perhaps the best feature is the use of the gt forcedriving force logitech wheel
the game is fully compatible to work with the wheelin the end while not groundbreaking by any means burnout is a fast arcade racer with pretty visuals great speed somewhat frustrating but solid gameplay superb controls and great dolby compatible audio  the object of this game is to race through busy streets driving as recklessly as you can
the more dangerous the driving nearmisses driving on the wrong side of the road skiddingetc
 the more your turbo builds up
once you get full turbo you can get up to speeds over  mph
but if you crash your turbo goes all the way down
you race against three other cpu computer controlled players the first to the finish line wins
usually there are  lapsyou can choose from  or so different cars and colors before you start racingthe cars are a truck a viperlike sports car a ford focuslike compact car a mitsubishilike sports car and a mecedeslike luxury car
you can unlock other cars by winning racesthis was a pretty good game it has some pretty awesome wrecks in it
and when you crash it automatically shows it again in slow motion that can be a good or bad thingi give the crashes a  the graphics a  and the replay value a its fun to play at first but once you lose interest in it you usually wont want to play it very muchi love this game
i love the mood of this game spooky foreboding
the gameplay style is interesting and the way the customization of characters goes is something new
the story is original and kind of captivating
i pretty much love everything about this game
but for some unexplained reason i dont ever get incredibly far into this game
it isnt because it is too hard something about it keeps making me take breaks and then going back to play it only ive forgotten what is going on
this is an unusual case for me but regardlessi think the game is worth a look whether you are into the wizardry series or you just like rpgsi felt like i was playing a dungeons and dragons campaign instead of a video game
you have the traditional dd classes races similar spells and a huge whopping dungeon
sure you cant go anywhere else but the dungeon in the game but there are multiple levels and townaffiliated quests
it has more than enough content
spell components and scrolls matter inventory matters disarming chests random traps identification of new items which may be cursed and most importantly what makes the game great trust mattersill repeat  trust mattersive gone through a terrible amount of normal roleplaying with humans where an idiot playing a character usually a spellcaster with supposedly high intelligencewisdom in my party goes and does something stupid
it ruins the experience because either you ignore it and keep playing or have a pointless argument with hurt feelings
this game takes care of that in a wonderful way and i really feel the same sort of roleplaying rush without the dicein this game if you dont treat your allies right like keep getting them killed they wont trust you and your party cant perform allied attacks necessary for later levels
i was skeptical too but the trust factor really makes the game for me
the story is about as developed as an average dd campaign not much
the game is mainly about exploring leveling and staying alive
an enormous amount of npc encounters inside the labyrinth add humoryouve heard the good but now for the bad
sounds can get repetitive menus could have been improved and combat takes too long
the graphics are fine they accurately convey a dungeon exploring expeditions experiencesa major downside is no fastforward for combat
by the time youre level  the monsters in the first areas of the dungeon are no challenge but it still takes time to walk through their areas even with shortcuts
you still have to select everyones actions and even using allied rush still means the encounter wasted thirty seconds of game playing
additionally the menu system inside the viggers store could have been way improved as i probably want to sell everything i just had identified and no if it is a cursed item i dont wish to equip it thanksoverall if you like dd dungeon crawls and dont mind video games having a lot of stats and items to keep track of buy this gameif youve never played a game with slow mo dives get this then enter the matrix
theres a good story line was well
the problem with this is the faces dont look ritecheckoutninja gaidandead to rightslike max paynethis game has translated extremely well to the xbox
the control scheme and button layout work wonderfully with the xbox controller a factor which surprised me
the graphics on this game are also top notchwhat really sets this game apart from other action games in the same genre is the use of quotbullet timequot
for those that dont know your character max payne has the ability to slow time down to a snails pace for when the action gets hectic or you simply want to look cool kicking some bootay
some may feel that this may get repertitive throughout the game but i never get tired of this aspectwhat the game is really lacking is a good story
it begins decently but gets boring within the first act
also the cut scenes are rather weak as is the voice actingunfortunately this is not multiplayer nor are their other options that set this version truly apart from its pc brethren
if you have the game for pc its really not worth picking up for the xbox
but it is definitely a top notch rental for those who havent played it beforei should warn you against buying this game
its not a short game by any means however it doesnt offer much resistance against finishing the game within a five day rental
and after finishing it it might just sit on your shelf for a while
good game good rental but poor replay value thus making it only a mediocre purchase in my opinionthe best thing max payne has going for it is a tremendously effective immediate atmosphere
from moment one you feel like youre a part of this gritty grimy underground world
youre convinced that drippy rusty pipes and dirty snow are the only constants in your own life and all of that helps to make the central character max himself much more understandable and sympathetic
all of the little things work together from the graphics to the storytelling to the various ambient sounds to the characters themselves to paint this immersive picture of a city overflowing with criminals corrupt cops selfcentered politicians and very few true good guys
even max himself is far from a squeaky clean dogooder and seems more like a comedically poetic punisher than a superman as he fires out one overly wordsmithed sentence after another like so many dirtencrusted bullets
really max only distances himself from the guys on the receiving end of his wrath through an admirable drive to discover the truth and a tragic origin and this lack of any true identifiable hero works toward that aforementioned greater good delivering a more realistic setting and allowing the story to take some liberties with its subject that would have otherwise been taboomaxs tale plays like a solid motion picture you come in just as the action gets interesting a rookie cop living the american dream comes home one night to discover a set of intruders in his house and fails to gun them down before they slaughter his wife and infant child and hang around as the antihero quickly loses his inhibitions and his mind accepting an undercover job that predictably goes bad and leaves him cut off in the middle of a criminal underworld that feels hes betrayed them
the story is compelling and is always laid out in one of two ways either through a liverendered cutscene in between scenarios or by way of a series of narrated graphic novelreminiscent storyboards
its nothing new to see a game featuring speaking parts in the middle of a mission any more but the paneled storyboard work that serves to bookend each sublevel is an interestingly novel concept that somehow manages to avoid the cheesiness youd think it would be drowning in
although the frames themselves are obviously based off of source photography and that photography looks like nothing more than a half dozen programmers and their friends out goofing off on the streets and occasionally shooting stills for a game they happen to be working on theres a certain charm to these pages that helps the player to further identify with the events that are going on within
its a nice break from all of the tense blood and guts action of the rest of the game to sit back and take in a quick comic bookbased scene even if that scene does happen to involve just as much blood and violence as the gameplayas payne slowly begins to lose friends and brain cells he also begins to lose his focus on reality and slides into several amazing if frustratingly tedious hallucinogenic nightmares and fantasies
these are the scenes that really help to set the storyline apart from its peers while at the same time dragging its gameplay a notch or two below that universal standard
the world spins hazily and blurrily around you your field of vision is always clouded by a sort of dizzying grey cloud things seem to move just a little bit too fluidly and time slows to a crawl they really are some of the best ingame visualizations of a dreamlike state ive ever seen and are crawling with the same sort of bloody twisted hopeless tone that fills the rest of the game
youll hear the last wails unleashed by maxs wife and the occasional wounded scream of his child off in the murky depths and the first three or four times theyll send shivers down your spine
once youre on your sixteenth jaunt through the area theyll grow more than a little annoying
still if it werent for these little bits and pieces of horror the game would tread dangerously close to straight action with no respitegameplay itself is slick and easy to master with the first few levels acting as a great primer for whats to come
theres no real lockon mechanism as is so prevalent in similar games but there is paynes infamous bullet time function which makes the process of aiming precisely at a moving target a bit less hairy
if youve seen the matrix then you probably already knew what i was talking about when i said bullet time and thus dont need a more detailed explanation but for those who havent max leaps into the air in some sort of dramatic gunwielding swan dive and from the moment he leaves the ground until the moment he touches dirt again time slows to a crawl
its the same sort of thing that was employed previously in conkers bad fur day and made you groan when you saw a cgi cow performing it in the trailer for kung pow a few years ago but is actually handled with some restraint so that it doesnt feel all that gimmicky and truly blends in as a helpful new gameplay element
you get a limited amount of bullet time to dole out exactly how much depends upon the difficulty level youve chosen so youre not doing it over and over and over again and youre given enough control of your actions in the middle of a dive to keep it from being an easy surefire kill every single timepaynes graphics have long been hailed as a measuring stick of sorts for the box and while ill certainly agree that theyre far above the standards set during the npsone war they havent aged all that well as this generations battles near their end
the textures and character animations have become almost runofthemill over the years and while that may say a thing or two about the games longlasting impact on the industry and the trends it may or may not have set it doesnt necessarily come across that way when played for the first time today
the characters themselves have always appeared to me as though they lacked real weight and mass
they look like scarecrows especially in profile with regularlysized heads and hands but stick arms and bodies with thick clothes just draped over to give the illusion of substance
the facial textures while beautiful dont look particularly professional and feel more like usersubmitted skins wrapped around the same body several times over
the constant smirk adorned by max himself only serves to further reinforce this sensation
the environmental textures that wow you from the ground level dont carry over as the skyscrapers near the roof level and while thats not something youll notice in the games first few levels later stages take place almost exclusively atop high rises and warehouses where the poor walls are featured front and center
building interiors are sufficiently varied with little bits and pieces of black humor thrown in like a porno poster on the wall or a hidden video camera facing the bedroom behind a false wall in a seedy hotel but occasionally distract you with sealed doorways that look identical to the doors youll need to be breaking open or casually pushing aside as the game progresses
this isnt a bad looking game but i wouldnt say its deserving of excessive praise either
its close but the effort and attention to detail seems to drip away as you reach the later levelsthe sound especially the voiceover work is very well done
although the majority of the game is merely accompanied by ambient noise and more often than not screaming and gunfire youll occasionally run into some music or white noise that is particularly effective in setting a mood or getting a laugh
the programs running on the few functional televisions youll discover are especially funny and smack of the kind of comedy youd expect from the various radio stations in modern chapters of grand theft auto
when somebodys speaking which is really quite often the voices suit the situations almost shockingly well
payne himself sports a deep gritty exceptionally noirdetective baritone and pounds out the games sometimes overthetop dialogue to terrific results
sometimes i have trouble discerning whether this game was meant to be a revival of the noir genre or a parody of it as the acting varies from extremely camp to chillingly effective and thats a fun line to walk as the events progressplaying a game of max payne is like owning a passably good movie on dvd
its not great it wont be bringing home any oscars and it isnt quite my definition of an epic mustsee production it is solid entertainment for a couple of nights
youll pop it in once in a while when you dont want to have to think about anything in particular and itll deliver a fun time
its got just enough depth to keep you motivated throughout a long session but momentarily entertaining enough not to demand your time in huge six hour bunches
i can see how those who rushed out to pick up their copy on release day were disappointed this isnt substantial enough a game to justify a full fifty bucks
its short relatively easy and overly linear
theres no immediate replay value despite the ability to unlock a few new modes of gameplay because theyre all essentially applying questionable new rules to the exact same game
it introduced a few new gameplay elements and represented itself strongly in both visual and audio but just doesnt have that undefinable it factor to push it up and above the rest of the pack
every time the story would take a step forward the gameplay would take a step back and vice versa
at this point in its lifespan and for the price youre likely to discover it for today id say payne is worth the expense but i can see why some of my running buddies felt betrayed by it back in  when they were expecting another gta which is pretty much what it was advertised as and got a straightforward noirera third person shootermax payne and its bullet time was the first game to allow the gamer to experience this innovative concept
what a breath of fresh air
i love the comic book picture storytelling and the linear story
like reading a detective novel
very interestingafter playing remedys amazing title alan wake and hearing news of a max payne  on the horizon i was convinced i had to go back and give the original max payne titles a go
max payne is a third person action shooter game inspired by action and noir films graphic novels and well the s
the game has a compelling story something frankly not seen in video games very oftenthe personal struggle of the game revolves around a tragic event that occurs to paynes family towards the beginning of the game and haunts him throughout
max is a cop for the nypd and is caught up in a drug war but gets thrown in the middle when he is framed for the death of a fellow officer
these two events force max to be a lone wolf killing mobsters rather than arresting them in an attempt to get revenge for his family and put an end to the drug war
the game has very mature themes dealing with drugs a haunting past and even satanismreviewing this game from a modern perspective the gameplay and graphics dont really compare with newer third person action titles such as alan wake red dead redemption or gears of war
max payne is basically a simple shoot em up with one unique feature bullet time
the easiest way to describe bullet time for modern players is by comparing it to dead eye in rdr
basically its a slow motion modeis the game worth playing now in 
for the general audience i would say honestly it depends
its a classic xbox title with a recognizable character in video game history
there are much better titles available now
but if you like remedy or are intrigued by the upcoming max payne  i would strongly recommend going back and trying this game
one last thing james mccaffery is an awesome narratorwow did it come fast
just in  days
the game when i got it looked brand new without the plastic wrap and the case is a clear dark green which is cool
not like an original xbox case
more like a clear xbox one works great and the game is fun
thought i should start out with the first max payne before max payne  comes outwhile this game is no quothaloquot it is still one of the top games for the xbox
the slow motion matrix effect is excellent and the graphics are top notchone of the few complaints i have with this game is the lack of a consistent quotfeelquot  there are so many stops for the comicbook like dialogue you cant ever really get in the groove of the game
i hope there is a sequelthis is the absolute best d shooter out there
it blows away anything you can think of
the only reason the other game is so highlighted is because its made by microsoft
i think however that most gamers will enjoy rockstars hard edgy approach to shooters though
the comicstyle boxed cut scenes between levels are very entertaining alsomax payne is a very good game but basically the only reason is that the creators came up with a innovative quotace up maxs sleevequot called bullettime
this slows down everything as if it were slow motion and max can aim realtime while the bad guys cannot
very cool once you actually try it
however it does feature repetive gameplay and the easier difficulty is too easy
here is a look  awful to  greatgameplay the movement camera functions weapons aiming shooting and bullettime are all well laidout and easy to master
the levelsboards to get through are somewhat repetitive and the cheesy storyboards with even worse dialogue can get annoying
no multiplayer big drawbackgraphics just very good all the way around nothing spectacular and nothing to complain about
solidreplay good replay value until you complete the mission which is not that difficult
you will want to sell it after that unless you cannot part with the bullettimeoverall a cool game while the novelty lasts
a few tweaks such as adding multiplayer and redoing the dialogue could have made it so much betteryou play as max payne ny cop
his wife and child get murked by some drug organization
he seeks revenge
lives are taken
nuff saidmaybe this explains why maxs face is forever twisted in constipation
max payne is a straight up third person shooter that controls like a fps
there are no puzzles just the occasional key you need to open the occasional locked door
the point is to go from room to room blasting fools
the one gimmick to this game is the bullet time
at the hit of a button the action slows down which the matrix ripped off max payne was already in development when the movie came out giving you an aiming advantage
it works pretty well you can take a bullet time dive and shoot like  guys in a room before you hit the ground
playing the game buzzed makes this even more excitingthe story is pretty lame and completely optional when it comes to enjoying this game
the only reason to sit through the cut scenes is to experience the great writing
max payne talks all poetic there was a chilling wind and the night was laden with foreboding which probably sounds stupid read here but in the cutscenes its pretty funny in a cheesy wannabe epic kind of way
its dope not because its great writing literally but because its purposely overdramatized
a good example is the moment max has a dream that hes in a videogame that everything thats happening is fakeso what youre left with is an entertaining action game with john woo style shootouts
the graphics still look solid the only obvious knock i can think of is that theres a couple of bloodline levels that are bound to tick you off
its a dream sequence max has where hes in total darkness with nothing around him
all he has to stand on is a red line supposedly a blood trail
this trail forks into different paths and you must jump from line to line trying to find your way out while hearing an annoyingly looped babycry
you will fall
you will start over
you will be pissedbut aside from that max payne is definitely worth whatever few bucks you can score a used copy for
i cant stress this enough the shotgun blasts sound really nice and youll have a good time with max payne and a  packmax payne only has bullets and retribution
his family murdered by junkies he sets out to wipe the city of the drug that cost them their lives opening a story that reeks of bullets slow motion shootouts and dark narrationframed for murder a fellow detective payne remains undercover within a mob family to discover the truth
among the bullet cases max meets some interesting characters such as twin assassin mona sax the mysterious alfred wooden and various trigger happy mobsters from separate feuding mob families
the story itself set amongst a typical revengevendetta genre unfolds smoothly with dreams of past events appearing between acts perfect for the john woo or tarantino film enthusiasts
payne sums up events  various conversations through his dark narration a true gem of the entire adventure
the uncommon comic storyboards replace modern cuts scenes set the perfect noir tonethis third person shooter features good graphics although characters dont have any facial expressions some have rag doll mechanics while others appear stiff as a board however both of these features hardly affect game play or enjoyment
controls handle fine a click of the control pad brings up the vast amount of weapons one can carry  trigger a strong characteristic bullet time
a fun serious advantage over the resourceful ai
that allows you to take out multiple enemies duck for cover or continue your current life best part being it replenishes with every kill
weapons all appear to be very closely patterned after their real life counter parts sounding great as you run for cover and return firemax payne is a great rental
for those who love high difficulty challenges its a must have and will get their moneys worth here
the look of a simple shooter united with great narration graphic novel cut scenes that play perfectly to the violent story atmosphere mythology overtone  film noir references that plaque the story payne is a standout title one that is a joy to play
the heros pain has only begunlast words b payne like this is so enjoyable its hard not to like itmax payne is definitly one of the best action games out thereprossweet graphicsa huge aresonal of weaponsbullet time puts enemies at your mercyshort but sweetnice graphic novel cutseenesquick save is titedont need to start all the way over like in the ps versionjust a pure actionshoot em up gameconshorrible voice actingplot starts good but later on it makes no sencenot much replay valuemax payne definitly brought hong kong shootout action films to life on consoles with propper justice
altho the dialoge is just plain out horrible the gameplay is what matters and the gameplay is all action
if you ever wanted a pure action game get this if you ever wanted to be chowyun fat this is as close as you get if you want a lengthy game rent this first cause its not that longpeacei rented this game because i had heard that it was short and yes it is now that i have had it for one day i am already halfway through the game
but there are four difficulty levels and you will want to play it time and time again because of the extreme fun and wonderful story
yeah the script is a little bit crappy not the voice acting
why cant people just tell the difference between voice acting and script
the voice acting is great wonderful quality
this game really is worth buying because it is so cheap but you could beat it just by renting
there is a very atmospheric feel to this gamenote to parents this game is not very bad at all i say that a  year old should be allowed to play it
some of the cutscenes you may want to skip but thats all
the only sc in this game is referenced nothing is shown
if you let your children go to public schools then they should be allowed to play this gamegameplay i thought the gameplay was excellent and veryaddictive
this was the first xbox game that ihave played so it took me about  minutesto get use to the controllers and the buttonsonce i got the controls down i felt sorry forall the bad guys i came acrossstoryi totally understood the story in the beginningbut then it started to get out of control
i didntfigure outwhat was going on until the end of thegame
max is an ex nyc police officer and he goesand discovers that his wife and newborn daughterwere murdered
he goes around the city to find outwho was responsibile for his loved ones murdergraphicsi have a ps also and i bought this game for thexbox because the graphics looked a little morecrisp compared to the psof course the graphicscannot top splinter cell or any other new gamesout right now
but the graphics do satisfyi recommend this game for anyone who likes grand theft autoi guess it is some what similaras long as you enjoy excellent graphics and gameplay you should enjoy this game
maybe you can understand the story better than me
hopefully max payne  the fall of max payne will live up to this game or surpass itce jeu est pas mal amusant  bons graphiques et bonne jouabilite
considerant le prix ce jeu est une aubaine
pour les fans de star wars je le recommande fortementive read reviews saying the worst things about this game and saying it was horriblethere were also great reviews on this game toothe graphics are bad and so are the voices but aside from that this is probably one of the best star wars games out thereawsome action such cool lightsaber battles and interesting levels the funnest and best way to tune tour battle skills are to play the battle royal
every jedi in the game verses everyoneits exciting when you win and you want to play it over and over againthe last fun thind to do is the darth maul fightoverall i took my chance with bad and good reviewstake the chance you wont regret itsawhen its all over thoughme and my friend always play this and halo every time he comes over we enjoy this just about as much as halo
it doesnt have the greatest graphics but the gameplay is fun and also really funny if u find some of the cool stuff and look at some of the little animations
its a fun single player game as well it doesnt last very long but oh well
you are able to reflect enemy bullets back on to them it will hit them right in the chest and theyll go down
you can throw your saber like a boomerang clear across the room
i like slowing down the game with the slow mo feature it doesnt really help but hey it looks cool
you can also pull guns straight out of the enemies hands
well all in all its a pretty good game to have around fun with friends too o yeah there is a cool battle royal game after u beat the gamebasically this is a rehash of jedi power battles jpb
thats not necessarily a bad thing
the game industry has been rehashing games for years
eg
gauntlet fifa car driving games
with each rehash the game has been upgraded to take advantage of the new technologyi enjoyed jpb and jedi knight and i would really enjoy playing an updated version of these games
obiwan is exactly that
it improves on the graphics and adds force capabilities push throw pull saber throw jump and character control acrobatics that were not present in jpbif you are looking for breakthrough graphics and game play this is not the game for you
if you need something to tie you over till jedi knight  comes out this will probably workthis is a good game dont mark me wrong but it is usually super easy including the darth maul fight and freeforall so i would suggest renting it first
then you can decided for yourselfanother impressive x box release star wars obiwan is one of the most awesome games out there
with great graphics clear sound excellent controls and exciting action this is fantastic fun for star wars fansobiwan centres around the adventures of young obiwan kenobi across five levels as he battles the evil trade federation the black heth crime organization and other assorted villians
as you battle your way through all the levels you can use force powers including force pushing your enemies and doing some stylish lightsaber moves
what the game lacks in surrounding detail it makes up for in action
the story is exciting if unoriginal but the plot does provide some lightsaber duels
i play this all the time and i never get tired of it
buy this gamegraphics sound fun factor star wars obi wan is a first person set preepisode one and its light saber combat truly shines
the misions though are a bit shorti am a huge fan of the star wars series and immediately buy each star wars game to see if they bring me into that universe
while ive been disappointed with many recent ones i was really pleased by obi wanthe light saber duels are really the shining part of the game
the fluidity and grace with which he moves really embodies the jedi knights years of training
add in a few force moves and you really do feel like you can take on seemingly overwhelming enemies and come out victorious
playing in multiplayer against a talented friend can challenge you for monthsthe game was pushed out for the release of the xbox so there are some down sides
the graphics dont really shine because the system was still being explored for its capabilities
the levels are very short
and there are a few bugs in the game that are mildly annoyingstill the game is great fun as a stylish combat system and any sequels using the base graphic engine will be a joy to playyou will def
have fun with this one
lightsabre battle is just awesome and using the force to your advantage certainly is funhowever there are disappointing aspects to this game
going through an entire level just to be killed a second or two into the final battle which mainly depends on luck is no fun
having to sit through several minuted of silly story ever time you attempt to make it through the first two seconds of the final fight of that same level plain  and the fact that all the dialogs in the game are pretty stupid and badly done doesnt helphowever the game certainly was good enough to make me play through the whole thing
its just that i would expect a bit more from lucasartsthis is a very good game for sw fans
avid gamers however probably will find it unacceptable
the graphics arent terribly great and the voiceacting is as bad as every other reviewer says
i also wish weapons other than the light saber were available more oftenobiwan a game that could have been a star title never attains greatness due to its subpar graphics engine
apparently the game uses a modified version of the yearold jedi knight engine and the engines age really shows with this game
models of characters have hidious textures and the low polygon count is really apparent
not to mention that the framerate often drops below fps which is unacceptable for a game with graphics such as thison the bright side the game is incredibly fun and action packed even more fun than the recently released graphically superior quotjedi knight quot
you will likely never get bored mastering the use of your lightsaber and various force powers and this excellent gameplay is what saves the game making it a worthwhile purchases
recommendedi really enjoyed the phantom menacestar wars episode when i first played it it wasnt the graphics that impressed me it wasnt the audio it was the game play
andstar warsobiwan i believe that the gameplay isnt as good but a supergraphical change along with audio improvements at leat thatswhat i think
star wars obiwan is a great game jedi battlethe  chapters of missions and training plus the rest ofthe content of the game add up to thisgraphicssuper manaudiothe phantom menace great likecontroli like it
overallthis  is a game id recommend to gamers only if they have notplayed star wars episode  the phantom menacepsdont forgetabout the oh ever great expanded more freedom of force powersin star wars obiwanthe fighting game known as mortal kombat returns with a portable game for game boy advance which features  selectable fighters from liu kang sub zero and scorpion to smoke noob saibot and jade
the game itself is exactly like the ultimate mortal kombat game which was released years ago for home systems
the fun part about the game is that every single move maneuver friendship and fatality is in the game but brutalities and animalities are not no one should care
also because of the limited buttons of game boy advance there is only one punch button and one kick button making each move easy to learn
the game might sound stupendous now until you play it the characters are rather slow and sometimes the animation jerks
with the one player mode you chose your fighter and proceed in one of four ladder tournaments finally battling the half man  half horse motaro and the evil emperor shao kahnok i was mad at this game
my cousin got this and i played it thinking wow they brought back mortal kombat
now i though it was going to be like mk or mk the better of all the other mk games but no the chose mk
i mean sure mk is an ok game but its no where to mk or mk
i think they should eather give up on mk games or start over from scratchwell namco has done it again
their latest collection of video arcade classics this time for playstation will be sure to please the classic arcade gamerthis collection includes pacman and ms pacman galaga and galaxian dig dug and pole positionnowhere else can you get this many really good old arcade classics than on this discpacman and ms pacman are faithfully rendered and play better than ever on a ps
theres even some quothiddenquot levels look for the easter egg to eat and a few more surprisesgalaga and galaxian have never looked better
they play just as good as i remember them from long agodig dug has every level that i can get to
its just as unusually addictive as i remember from the arcadespole position looks good but plays really strangely without a steering wheelthe inclusion of pole position which some people may find harder to play without a steering wheel is the only thing that kept this disc from getting a quotperfectquot five star rating from me
maybe if enough sell theyll consider doing more arcade classics for ps
well worth your time and money especially if youre into classic arcade gameswhen playstation was thriving namco came up with  compilation disc called namco museum
their marketing tactic was that put about  to  games on each compilation disc put one or two desirable games then put some unpopular ones along with popular ones
so i ended up getting only one namco museum with galaga in it because that was the one of my favorite games i wanted to play along with pacman and digduggood thing about this ps compilation disc is that namco decided to put more popular games like galaga pacman and digdug all together along with rearranged enhanced version
if you were trying to get all three games then you would have to buy  seperate playstation one games
the reason i bought this game is because not only it had all three favorite games i wanted to play but the enhanced version of galaga and pacman are enhanced enough for you to enjoy not just change of music or some special sound effectsso if you are into old arcade classics like galaga pacman and digdug and dont mind spending around  bucks then get your copy
nostalgic factor itself is worth itoh one more thing when i looked at the back of game case i thought galagas rearranged version as galaga  however make no mistake that its not galaga  one which you could move your space ship not only horizontally but also vertically
enjoy itgood morning allpacman ms pacman dig dug galaga pole position pole position iiwho did not play any of one of these guys when they were younger in the s
the namco museum presents all these classics in all their glory plus some special quotnewquot versions some that are locked for your psrealistically i only bought this game so my mom can occupy herself sometime with some recreation she gets so stressed out sometime
she played many of these games back in the day when we still had the atari  around and these days most games are simpl beyond her
but these old school games are right up her alleymy favorites of this package are galaga galaga arrangement dig dug and the pac man games havent unlocked the pac man arrangement games yet
pole positionpole position ii were great games in their time but they are very difficult to play with your standard ps controller
you may be better off sticking with gran turismo in this case or playing with the steering wheel if you have oneif you love old school games this package is for you
the games play very well even with the ps controller except pole positionnow you do not have to go to a dive bar or an airport arcade lounge to play your favorite s video games
i can still remember when pacman was the talk of the town and you had to fight to get on a machine
this namco compilation is good and will keep you and  your guests entertained for hours upon hours of good clean fun
where else can  you get good clean fun these days
at the supermarket
i do not think so
the mspac man segment is enough to keep you busy for days just trying to beat the game
pole position just is not grand tourismo but it is still fun to blow up every time you touch a sign post
you will be happy you bought this game to take you back to the sjoseph dworakdont let the back of the box trick ya into thinking you are getting  classics and  new totaling  games it is  games unlockable games are realy additional levels to pacman games but still fun
you get more if you buy the  seperate ps game volumesfinaly all the arcade hits with special new graphics from the newer arcade rereleases
this game is classic fun and nonstop entertainment if you have a friend to play it with
but is it worth  dollars
yeah i guessyou should pretty much already know what this game is about if youre reading reviews
if youre buying used be careful since gamecube discs are notorious for being riddled with game destroying errorsive been playing this game for  hours straight
right out of the box unpatched without a single crash at x resolution with the draw distance set satisfyingly high and ive only noticed a few times when it even slows down a little
and im not even talking unplayable i just mean a little slowdown here and thereheres the best partati xpert  pro graphics card practically a dinosaur at this point mhz processor megs of ramyou dont need a monster machine to play this gameanyway now that i got that out of the way  this game is pretty cool
ive never really played any rpgs on the pc
the amount of freedom and the immensity of the world make this game a must havefun fun fun and addictive
why did you only give it  stars then
you askahh the dreaded complaint
where i take something that i enjoy and tarnish its namethe only serious complaint i have about this game so far is the laughable no utterly ludicrous way that the battles are handled
i know they tried to make it somewhat resemble the old turn based rpg combat where you had a certain percent of a chance to either hit or miss and then the enemy gets his turn to either hit or miss  that was all well and good for its time but it most definately does not work in a first person game
for a hilarious examplei decided to go into battle mode with an unarmed man in his home
he was wearing simple clothes with only his fists to defend himself
i was wearing a full suit of steel armor and brandishing a steel longsword
you could clearly see that my sword was penetrating his throat over and over and over again not just nicking his throat i was only a few feet away from him and the sword was going through his throat many times yet for something like every  stabbings only one of them would actually count as a hit and the rest of them apparently missed
not only that but this guy must have been zeus in disguise because he actually killed me with his fists and me in full steel armori know i know its not doom or quake but that kind of thing seriously detracts from the realism element that this game otherwise has down patso thats why  stars instead of otherwise and in almost every way this game is incredibleat least so far
im only level  right now but i expect it to only get better and more complex
and hopefully my character will eventually learn how to actually hit a stationary target from three feet away with a longswordi have to say this is one of the best video games ive played
ive played a few rpgs such as baldurs gate but morrowind has more of an openended dowhatyouwant dd feel than all of them
the graphics are beautifully rendered character creation is fun and versatile and replayability is huge
i intend to replay this game with different characters various downloaded plugins and with some of my own plugins once i take the notion to start fiddling with the construction set that comes with the game
this game is certainly not for those who like structure and firm storylines
there are simply too many things to do and see and the game really entices you to get sidetracked which to me is one of its strengthsin a nutshell sound effects and music are good visuals are state of the art especially outside gameplay is engaging though on occasion some quests become monotonous and one does have to get use to being rather alone in a world of uninspiring npcs and the possibilities of the game thanks to the construction editor are virtually limitlessone warning as many have said here system requirements that is what you need to run the game smoothly are quite high
this is a game made for tomorrows computer
also many players will experience at least some technical issues with the game such as crashes and freezes especially regarding memory management and its oversensitivity to certain hardware configurations and settings
if you know someone who has the game it would be a good idea to borrow it and test it on your computer before buying it
otherwise this is a fantastic game that sets a new standard for the roleplaying genrerating   starsthis game is a classic it is ridiculously complex and wildly customizable
get it waste  hours of your life then play it every day you can get a free minuettheres a lot to like about morrowind but perhaps my favorite feature is that you can go anywhere and be anyone you want
the world is very large so large in fact that travel is impractical without using one of the forms of public transportationi found that the most fun in the game wasnt following the storyline but just wandering the countryside looking for adventureand the game looks fabulous
i bought a geforce ti  just for the occasion but also played on a gefore ultra and found that it looked almost as good though the water effects with the geforce were amazingreplayability is very high
i played a straightup fighter my first time through and never cast a spell
i would simply close with the enemy and beat the bejeebers out of him
i will play the game again as more of a stealth mage type characteron the downside the game pauses constantly to load when youre in the wilderness
once i got the boots of blinding speed the game would pause about ever  seconds
also i found the ending of the game to be rather dull
you run from town to town trying to gain approval like some kind of politicianthese are both pretty serious flaws which just goes to show how good the game is that i would still give it  starsone more thing since i did a lot of exploration and adventuring before jumping into the main quest encounters in the main adventure ended up being pretty simple
i finished the game at th level but i believe it could be done  or  levels lower than thatthere is rivalry between the great houses cults and necromancy is on the rise
will you bring peace to the world
are you the prophesied one
come and explore the land of morrowind and get set for quite the adventurehow do i startyou begin the game being rescued from a prisoner ship
why were you released
youll find out later if you choose to follow the storyline
yes its optional  from the ship you will get to choose your race sign you were born and character type
there are various ways of determining your character type
you can answer questions that will decide for you pick from a list or fill out the forum yourself
there are many races to choose from including dark elf high elf wood elf imperial red guard orc nord breton argonian lizard and khajiit feline
all having their own strengths and weaknessesi got my character now whattalk to people
you will see how much they like you by their persuasion towards you
some species are better off than others in this regard
you can  raise your speechcraft skill but other ways to gain peoples trust is to help or bribe them
you have a reputation meter the more people you help the more famous you will become
the best way to get people to like you is to join guilds and climb up the rank ladder by performing tasks for the guildguildsblades spiesfighters guildimperial cultmages guildmorag tong assassinstemplethieves guildhow do i increase my attributesthere are many attributes you can assign and specialize your character in
you can increase these attributes by using them getting trained or by reading certain books
the best way to get experience is to hunt or fight monsters
when you join a guild get trained by them
the more they like you the cheaper the rates will bewhat kind of quests will i go onthe story line is open ended in this game
you can follow it or do your own thing
often times you will be asked to help other people out in various ways
the guilds you join will have you do tasks to gain rank
some of these quests include killing robbers solving murders stealing valuable items and artifacts
walking down the main roads you have opportunities to help unite love birds and escort people to rough areas
there is so much to do in this game the list goes onappropriatefrom a christian perspective this game has violence
you will definitely have to kill various monsters
killing people can usually be avoided often times you can settle things peacefully via bribe or working things out
some guilds like the fighters guild or morag tong guild require you to execute people or thieves
there is also a thieves guild which requires you to steal items
basically you are as good of a character you choose to be
you do not have to join any guild but they do have their advantages
there is some swearing and alcoholdrug use in the game
there is a club call house of earthly delights with female dancers wearing only bra and underwear
magic use is prevalent in this game
again you dont have to use it but it will be used on you
there are references to necromancy and vampires too
finally some symbols found in the game are obelisks and the crescent moonoverall experienceease of usethis game is easy to install and play
when talking to characters in the game there are hot topics that you can click on and get more information from them
to move around you use the wasd keys and the mouse to look
you can play in first or third person perspective
the graphics are amazing
the world is very realistic you will experience different weather conditions from fog to sand storms night and day etc
the character and armor detail is great too
they reuse many of the faces so many of the guards look alike
my only complaint with the graphics engine is that it loads often and it can be slow at timesthe sound and eax effects were the best in any game i have ever played
the voice acting was great and the musical score was very well done
the collector edition has a music cd but for everyone else you can convert the mps or listen to them as is
stability wise this game could use a little tweaking
it did crash to my desktop once but what gets me is that it does not alttab very well
the ai can use some help too
there are a few quests where characters want you to escort them to someplace or someone
every time i had to backtrack only to find them running into a bush or around in circles
its a bit annoying but oh wellthis is a single player only game
there is so much to do i doubt youll get bored anytime soon
there are some official mods released for the game and many unofficial ones
some of the unofficial ones allow you to become a jedi or a ninja and use their actual weapons
youll definitely get your moneys worth in this game
its a good game but i recommend it only for teens and adultsthe game world is huge
if you like first person and rpgs then this is a must
excellent graphics
many skills
the ability to enchant your own items
create your own spells
and tons of quests
get the expansion too and youll have lots of gameplayive got waaayy too much to say about this game and not enough space hence ill just do bullet points
but overall  wow
 character creation was an enjoyable game unto itself
with many races classes and abilities to choose from this portion of the game can take hours if you so desire
 load times are obscene
the program itself takes minutes on my amdathlon wmb of ram
individual game loads take about a full minute to  minutes
each time you opens a door yet another load time for the next environment
this is very much a game of hurryupandwait
 the soundtrack is nice and includes music animal sounds and ambient environmental cues
 the scenery is lovely and detailed
the colors are pleasant subdued shades and are easy on the eyes
the sky is stunning especially at night
there are good weather effects including great thunderstorms
 the land of vvardenfell is insanely huge  i cannot fully express its hugeness
the overwhelming size of the land is a mixed blessing its frustrating to run back and forth over long distances repeatedly and it can take  minutes to reach a destination
but the size also allows the game its diversity and complexity
there are so many unmapped hidden areas that exploring kept my interest for many hours in the first weeks
 battling fatigue will be a thorn in every players side they could have done much better here
 the journal is very disorganized
there is no questsataglance section nor are completed quests crossed out
further not all important information is logged there
 most of the monsters were creativelywrought and had great ambient behaviors if watched
this holds true for the humanoid characters as well scratching mumbling eating and assorted other behaviors add depth to everything
 when speaking to an npc you have to click on the letters in textboxes  if you click in the space between two letters or even in the hole in the middle of an o nothing registers
 a big plus is being able to save at any time during the game even during combat
 merchants in the game have very little money to trade for goods which makes finding valuable items nearly worthless
its sometimes possible to work some creative trading but by and large the merchants should have about five times more cash
 attributes and skills increase as they are used which is perfect jumping a lot increases your athletics skills and so forth
there is also training available for a price
 one nice touch is that after some inactivity the game will automatically zoom out from the character and slowly rotate around it
the character engages in many of the same ambient behaviors i mentioned previously
there is also a thirdperson view you can freely rotate all around the character zooming in and out to see how your character looks
its difficult to fight in this view however
 combat is pretty straightforward and doesnt involve a lot of creativity
hack and slash is easiest as spells are often hard to  cast during battle
however its easy to hit the wrong target inadvertently during battles which can sometimes kill off a person following you an innocent standerby or even a person crucial to the completion of the game
highly vexing
 occassionally it is possible to ruin your chances of completing a quest or of obtaining advancement through a given quest by stumbling onto an area or an item too soon in the game and then selling it or otherwise losing it
this is highly frustrating
 there are a whoooole bunch of quests to be had and its very easy to lose track of the main quest early on
in fact i got so sidetracked by the various guild quests that i completely forgot there even was a main quest for months
honestly
 spells and magic are a huge part of vvardenfell and the number of potential spells to learn is staggering
 there are some nuisance animals in the game
one species in particular the cliff racer can be expected to swoop down on the character at intervals of  seconds in most regions of the land
fighting them is tedious timeconsuming and reeeeally irritating after about the first hour but they never go away
 nearly every single object in the land can be picked uptaken including many books some for increases in skills
if you pick up someone elses property though you will be attacked and possibly killed
 occasionally the game crashes for no reason
sometimes it knows exactly why its crashing and tells you something happened
sorry about that
the system will now crash
have a nice day
arrrrgh
 the main quest seems more like a sidebar to the rest of the game
the repetitive aspects of some of the main quests trials are tiresome although one can actually complete them in short order with the right strategies
its great that one can keep playing when its complete toodespite its numerous flaws this is an amazing game
my final impression is one of basic satisfaction
the most impressive features of morrowind are its depth and complexity there is very little a character cannot do here and more than  hours of gameplay in which to do them
bethesda softworks has created something quite extraordinary with this game and i applaud them for their effortsmorrowind is the third installment in the classic elder scrolls series of pc roleplaying games from bethesda softworks which began with arena and was followed thereafter by daggerfall
morrowind continues the sprawling tradition of its forebears and provides a massive open world for you to explore  not to mention a wealth of character creating options
this time around bugs are fairly few and far between unlike daggerfall which was one of the buggiest games ever made but the experience suffers from a few significant if not at all crucial faultsthe elder scrolls series has always had one thing above all else in its favor depth
morrowind is no exception though it somehow feels shallower than arena
to anyone unfamiliar with the series at large though the world may appear so vast that initially its downright confounding
without the official bethesda guide you stand no chance whatsoever of discovering everything that the game has to offer and even then you may miss a few things here and there
i dare say the developers themselves could be surprised every now and again if you were to set them down in front of the game
its so huge you have to see it to believe it
freedom is the name of this particular game and you are limited only by morrowinds surrounding seas and your own statistics
if you want a game to last you a year or more even if you play it constantly then morrowind is the one to gethowever despite all of its successes morrowind has its fair share of problems  especially if like me you are an avid fan of the series and have been playing it these past ten years
for starters though the games graphics are generally excellent the whole province of morrowind is lacking in diversity
many of the games villages and cities look much like one another in all but their layout with a few exceptions and even the games dungeons are difficult to distinguish from one another
to make matters worse there are few vivid colors
everything has a drab washed out look to it which further subdues any variety in the scenery
the more one plays the more annoying this becomes  particularly if youre an elder scrolls vet
i miss the varied landscapes of arena and even daggerfall
i miss traversing the marshlands and deserts and snowscapes of tamriel and delighting in that variety
morrowind just sticks you in one dusty province and leaves you there
the weather effects do provide some nice ambience but dont expect to see the seasons change in the arena or daggerfall mold
you may have just as much freedom to roam but its not as exciting as it used to bea tighter main storyline would certainly have helped the game to gel a little better
there is very little story to speak of here and too often you will find yourself playing errand boy instead of adventurer
personally i would rather the main storys quests involve more combat and less banter with npcs  and i would certainly rather not spend as much of the game running from point a all the way to point b which may or may not be halfway across the province
on top of that most of what you will find between point a and point b is predictable and leaves little room for excitement or the thrill of discovery which was so prevalent in the earlier elder scrolls games
and why do you have to read all the text in a modern pc game
i understand that if an actor were hired to voice every npc in the game the game would never be finished given the extent and variety of the stuff but there is no reason why pivotal characters in the main quest should not be voiced
that would make the story more compelling certainly  because i dont play pc games to read thousands upon thousands of words of text
if i wanted that i would go buy a novel
if knights of the old republic can voice virtually every character in the game then morrowind can certainly voice its primary playersthe real fun to be had in morrowind oddly enough does not come from completing the primary storyline which is not even required
no the real fun comes from joining guilds and performing quests for them as you rise in their ranks  or from doing your very own thing
if you want to simply wander the province explore dungeons and kill lots and lots of monsters you can do that and its quite fun
the combat is not very involved but some of the more powerful and wellmodeled enemies will certainly give you a thrill
besides that there is more than enough loot in morrowind to satisfy any wouldbe treasure hunter
if youre looking for a fantasy roleplaying game thats all about a tight cinematic story you had better look elsewhere
if its freedom you crave then youll have it with morrowind
you can even become a vampire and stalk the living
how is that for freedomall in all morrowind is a fantastic game though it can sometimes feel more like work than play
still it does not hold a candle to arena though its predecessor is nearly ten years old  but few roleplaying games do to be quite honest
for all its disappointments morrowind is certainly worth the effort and will provide a nice escape from the mundanefinal score bthe elder scrolls iii morrowind mw is without a doubt one of the most ambitious roleplaying games to date
mw begins with your character arriving as a prisoner on a strange new island
as the opening sequence progresses your character is slowly asked questions that determine his or her attributes skills and appearance
the local captain gives you amnesty in return for a favor and the game beginsthe entire island is yours to explore cities dungeons mountains isles or any people that exist on this island known as vvardenfell
with the exception of online games that require monthly fees such as everquest and ultima online no pc game has a larger world to explorethe game is openended and your character can live as a hero that rescues those in need or you can become a dastardly criminal with a large bounty on your head
the island of vvardenfell is home to a race of dark elves and as your character explores the island he or she will learn about the various political powers that control the island
your character can join a number of factions such as the mage guilds thief guilds a local aristocracy a secret assassins guild and even a clan of vampires
there are thousands of spells weapons armor clothes potions and anything else you can think ofthat being said i have a warning about mw
if you have a lowend system pentium ii mb video card mb ram or less do not purchase mw
it says on the box that the game supports some of the specs i just listed but its not true
lots of ram and a great video card are probably the most important things to have in your computer if you expect to play a smooth game
another warning is if youre not familiar with computers youre purchasing the wrong game because mw needs every aspect of your computer drivers directx performance tweaks to be in sync to work properlyaction fans    stars  while mw plays like a firstperson shooter with its viewpoint and weapons system it is the furthest thing from a fastpaced fps
if you are a dedicated action gamer i would hesitate before purchasing mw because the game moves at a slow pace and requires plenty of downloading when traveling
if you have enjoyed roleplaying games before you will probably like mw but i would recommend that others wait for a possible demostrategy fans    stars  the only strategy required in mw is that you remember everything youve been told which can be quite a lot
there are a few quests that require puzzle solving but for the most part mw is a hack and slash game in the middle of a grand story
if youve enjoyed roleplaying games before mw will probably satisfy youadventurerpg fans   stars  the pc gaming market doesnt see many quality rpgs
since the fan favorite baldurs gate ii was released there have been a few quality rpgs but not until mw has an rpg been released that has garnered such universal appeal
mw goes the extra mile and expands on everything youve ever encountered in a roleplaying game be it an incredibly large island to explore or even hundreds of books about local lore
not wishing to reveal too much if youve ever read the wheel of time book series you already have an idea what the story in mw is likebugs    stars  this is the one bad thing about mw and a huge problem
no matter how hitech your computer is mw is full of bugs
many games these days are released before they are ready and mw appears to fall in that category
if you are a gamer that is easily frustrated with crashes i would wait a few months before buying mw
not only has my game crashed to the desktop several times but i have encountered numerous freezes
there are plenty of glitches such as broken quests and environments that you character can get physically stuck in
while a game this advanced needs a quality system to run smoothly there is probably a memory leak as it shouldnt have this many problems on highend systems
maybe after several patches the game will run better but be prepared for frustrationreplay value    stars  mw was shipped with a comprehensive construction set that allows you to edit almost any aspect of the game
you can change races building locations create new islands and quests  almost anything
youll need an expensive software program called d studio max if you intend to make new models but you can use any art program on the available meshes and you can move or recreate anything in the game into a file called a plugin
before you start the game you can select which plugins you would like to use
because of this great feature youll never alter the games essential files and the only problems you will encounter are if you try to take out plugins that your character was using in the latest save game file
already there are tons of plugins available for download on the internet
the tutorial included in the construction set is terrible and i would recommend searching mw fan websites as many generous gamers have written easytofollow tutorials for all features of the construction set
one negative aspect about the replay value in mw is through all the plugins the game still depends on a quest system
to advance in power and rank affiliations your character needs to complete quests for the group he or she belongs to
if at any time you as a gamer become bored with this quest system youll quickly become bored with the game
in all fairness ive played rpgs with better stories than mw but it still can hold its own to most of the great rpgs to hit the pcbefore writing a review for a game i usually either finish it for the good ones or deem it unplayable for the bad ones
these people who write reviews before ever having played the game sort of boggle my mind a littleanyway i was all set to buy this game for my xbox as i knew it was going to be a resource hog one that my aging pc was unlikely unable to push
to make a long story short i ended up getting the pc version for three reasons  it came out weeks before the xbox version weeks mean years for those of the short attention span  it has a massive campaign editor and construction set  because of  there are going to be lots of official and unofficial addons and plug ins one of which ive already downloadedalways give bad news first this game is the resource hog i feared it would be
if your running anything less than the best prepared to either upgrade or lag
my pc has a  ghz processor  megs of ram soundblaster live platium and an old  meg geforce
i was able to play the game reasonably well at  x  but it was nothing to write home about
the performance was poor at best especially in the out of doors
the graphics look pretty lame at this low resolution and those sophisticated textures look like poopoo at anything less than  x   fortunately i found a  meg radeon  video card a couple of days ago really cheap and decided to go with it
this has helped immensely
i can now go as high as my monitor will allow  x  and the graphics look much better
i still experience some lag outside but the performance is much better
if you dont have a beast cant afford to upgrade and own an xbox i advise you to get the xbox version and save yourself a lot of headachesmore complaints morrowind has some very irritating little glitches that cause you to get stuck behind stuff on the sides of hills between objects etc
the movement is pretty clunky to begin with which is further hindered by your characters attributes
there have been several instances where ive had to revert to a previous save because of this whihc can be absolutely maddening
save often and be prepared for this one its one of my biggest complaintsok a few more random complaints and then ill get to the good stuff
the interface as a whole will take some getting used too
i still dont like the inventory menu with the teeny tiny little items that you couldnt possibly tell apart if not for the popup windows
also be prepared to do a lot of wandering around aimlessly to find certain buildings and items
when a npc sends you on a quest he updates your journal with text based instructions if you think to ask for them and doesnt update your map for you
the map is so huge that it can take awhile to get where youre going
also i tried walking from one city to another with my first character big mistake
it took forever and i never did get there
the scale on the game is huge this is a good thing and a bad thing
get attacked start running for your life and the next thing you know youre lost
there are signs posted here and there but somtimes you can get way off track before you find a new one
also no multiplayer nuff said thereok now for the good stuff this game boasts what may be the largest most detailed simulated world ever created
just wandering around gives you a sense of awe an immensity unlike any game ive ever played before including everquest
the rich textures huge mountains and detailed terrain must be experienced in the finest detail possible or quite frankly you arent getting your moneys worth
while games like baldurs gate rely on strong story to create a compelling world worth returning too morrowind doesnt really have too
from the moment you step off the boat youre there
fortunately morrowinds beautiful world is supported by a strong story
like any rpg worth its salt there are hundreds possibly thousands of quests miniquests and hidden details that make the most mundane walk through the swamps worth your while
the style and look of the game is just breathtaking and honestly like nothing ive ever seen before
it is equal parts weird and amazing
bottom line its an incredible world worth exploring which will be directly affected by your actions unlike those everqust type gamesone of the things i liked immediately is the character creation process which you can do one of several ways
first you pick a race some of which are fantasy staples like elves and orcs but also includes a race of cat people and lizard men that look really cool
once youve chosen your race you can choose class by either answering a few simple questions that will determine your class by gaging your or your characters personality and preferences you can choose a class from the list there are lots of classes or you can create your own custom class
these options really provide a lot of diversity
i test drove a couple of characters from various methods before settling on the one i use nowit takes a while for the game to get going but once you build up some momentum it is incredibly fun
save often in the beginning as even the peons will be taking you out or so it will seem
finding a character that fits your playing style is almost as fun and challenging as the game itself
there is so much variety between races and characters it is unbelievable
im so glad i bought the new video card and didnt give up on this game after the first couple of days
if youve got a system that exceeds the recommended requirements and are patient you will be rewarded
with all its flaws hopefully a patch will remedy most of them this game is worth your while
it is a true achievementi got this game shortly after it came out and i love it
that said i can see why some people may hate it
if your idea of an rpg game is diablo or diablo ii you most likely will not like this game
in addition this is one of the few crpgs i have seen that does not hold your hand very much
expect to be pointed in the direction of the main quest and be cut loosegraphicsthey really dont excell i will admit however it gets the job done
keep in mind that if graphics were made much more detailed your computer would be brought to its knees regardless of how powerful your machine is
the graphics arnt anything to marvle at exception their night time skys are beautiful to the point where sometimes during the game i would sit and watch the sky for awhile but they arnt horrible to the point where they detract from the gamegameplaygameplay as i have already stated is extreamly open ended
you are pointed in the direction of the main quest right after completing character generation but that is it
there is nothing at all forcing you to pick up the main quest immediately or even at all you can even fail in the main quest and continue playing
you can join a multitude of factions or even one of the noble houses
with work you can even become the head of one or several of these factions though it doesnt carry too many benifits with it sadlyif you are new to crpgs this may overwhelm you because the game really does not hold your hand
also it will not stop you from walking into situations or places where you will get killed
as a result i would suggest saving periodically since it is entirely possible to walk into your death and have to start over from hours agoif you get over the open ended concept of the game there is a lot to do
as i said i have had the game since it first came out and i still have not completed all the quests in morrowind let alone the expansion packs
add to this the ability of players to modify the game by adding in questsitemspeopleentire land masses and you have the possibility to never completely finish the gamethis may be a problem for some people who expect a game to end once they finish off the final boss
the game keeps on going even after that
it also may be a problem who dont enjoy games that are too involved
i could see someone simply not cairing anymore by the time they get to the final bosscombatcombat honestly can be a big let down especially if you turn on the option that makes it so that your best attack is the one that is always used
it basically ammounts to swinging your weapon at the other guy until he falls down though honestly moving around does help a lot
if you dont have the option that always makes your best attack the one that is used combat does become a little more involved as you manuver and use different attacksmagicthe magic system is much better than the combat system actually
you have the ability to buy many different spells and even create your own
there are also many different types of magic spells
illusions that let you effect other people or turn invisable
alterations that allow you to levitate or cause your pack to become lighter or someone elses pack to become heavier destruction which lets you kill people restoration that lets you heal others and yourself summoning spells which allow you to call up help from minions or even summon weapons to your aid enchanting that allows you to use enchanted items more efficently and enchant your own weapons and mysticism which allows you to resist other peoples magic or teleport aroundconstruction setthe construction set is a wonderful addition
as far as i can tell if you can dream it up you can add it to the game if you use the construction set
already there are many mods out there for the game and quite a few very good ones
while it is possible to mess up your game in horrible ways with the construction set to fix this you simply stop using that particular mod
one word of warning i will give people is that mods that are extreamly ambitious tend to slow the game down a lot
likewise using too many mods will have the same effect
most mods however are well done and well thought outbad thingsthe game does have some flaws
first of all you will want to get it patched
even when patched however it does sometimes kick me back to the desk top
this usually happens when some other process starts running like norton updating or when the game has been running for a very long time
also there are some graphic glitches that happen sometimes like falling through the floor returns you to where you entered or getting stuck in spots that are impossible to escape from having a poll go right through your body somehow so that you cannot move away from it
even so these things happen very rarely in my experience and in fact can be fixed in game by using teleport type spellsto sum things up if you drool at the ideas of open ended play and near unlimited unplayability then you should give this game a shot
it may take some time to get used to how things are done but it is extreamly fun once you get the hang of it
if on the other hand you get frustrated easily or are looking for a game which can be beaten morrowind will probably leave you feeling lost or leave you wondering why you care about the final boss any moreyou are dumped or possibly released off a prison boat into the land of wierd plants alien wildlife and a mixture of inhabitants not unlike the menagerie from star warsall you know is that someone in a nearby town directions to which you have been told but unfortunately forgotten is looking for you and it might be a good idea to find out what this individual wantsthis game maybe hard to get drawn into at least it was for me
the reason for that there is no clear path shown for you npcs dont have convenient signs on them saying click me to continue
 in fact most of them seem downright scary and hatefulthen you start asking them questions and start to learn options for what to do next emerge
you have better understanding of the inhabitants the interconnections struggles you learn about different factions and organizations within this land about their goals and ideologiessome of these goals are personal and selfish others very political in nature or zelous in their religiosity and some of them are so epic in scope theyre stretching millenia back into the past between all those agendas you are slowly finding your own
that is when the game truly begins because of some technical issues which i wont go intolore and amount of backstory put into this game is extraordinary
there are books in the game that have an entire mythologies in them
the story itself is complex no entirely good or bad guys here although ultimately the player has to take sides and make choicesarchitecture changes greatly depending on the area and culture
from a cross between arabianlike dwellings and italian villas to the round houses in the tops of gigantic mushroom trees and houses made out of  shells of some big dead creatures and also some kind of medievallike castles however built and inhabited by a culture similar to that of ancient romethis is a great game
the story is cool the world map is amazing and so is the freedom to build your own character
i will say that escort missions are annoying the journal isnt well organized like in the other games and dice rolls factoring into your attacks isnt fun
but other than that its a wonderful game and a good starting point for anyone wanting to get into elder scrollsthe elder scrolls iii morrowind bethesda softworks so i picked up morrowind a few years ago when i still had a computer that was capable of running most things
i installed it and the best i could get out of it after all the tweaking i could do was fps
it says something about the game that i played it for weeks with fps
i had never seen anything quite like it and i was willing to take ten minutes to get from building a to building b just to look at the amazing graphicsi upgraded the computer a while ago and i dusted off morrowind and started playing again about three months ago
the new computer actually runs it like a computer game instead of an art slideshow so i can finally say something about iti played briefly both arena and daggerfall the first two elder scrolls games
i was put off both by the absolutely horrible combat interface despite having heard so many wonderful things about daggerfalls gameplay
the first thing i noticed was that bethesda has made the combat interface far far simpler now a simple use best attack automatically checkbox will stop you from having to learn eighteen different ways to swing a sword thankfully
the second was that the characterbuilding interface is much much better in this one daggerfalls was already head and shoulders above that of other cfrpgs so much so that it was riffed on in the best freeware rpg on the planet adom but morrowind expands the character creation interface allowing for as much or as little detail as the player would like you can choose one of the premade character kits have the game choose one for you by answering questions a la daggerfall or customize your own
from there the game just sits at your feet waiting for commands
there is a main storyline and those who like linear gameplay can get involved in it immediately for the rest of you theres the rest of vvardenfell
the game can be as linear or nonlinear as the player would like it to be with only a few things closed off to newbies usually trainers or traders who dead with highlevel stuff the way theyre closed off though is so nonintrusive as to not bother the average player at all
there are hundreds maybe thousands of easter eggs to be had throughout vvardenfell encouraging exploration for the sake of exploration rather than to follow a dull overused storyline as in most cfrpgs
quests outside the main storyline are also to be found in great abundance and players can spend months of both game and realtime doing those while nursing the main storyline again assuming you opt to follow it along at whatever pace the player likes
i assume the ability to get kicked out of guilds for just not doing anything still exists ive yet to run across it
and as i mentioned before the artwork is stunning
in  there wasnt another computer game that included anything close to this level of detail
at the end of  there are a handful of games that match it but none of them have the same feel as morrowind as realistic as things often look theres still a weird outofplace feel to it all that makes many situations that much more disturbingmany of the complaints originally voiced by players in the game have been silenced thanks to the two addons and a few patches i do suggest getting both bloodmoon and tribunal as well and installing them then patching before playing
even with the patches i still use a notebook to track quests and the like but the game does do it for you nowthe last game that kept me up this late at night this often was lords of magic back in the midnineties
morrowind is one for the ages
 wow a game that lets you do anything that you want
you have probably heard this before but this game is huge with fabulous graphics
it does have some problems though ill get them out of the way first
now you probably thing that i am going to complain about the system requirements but im not
that is because i have a  gigahert p computer with a  ram geforce  mx video card and the game runs fine it doesnt slow down at all
what is does do is crash about every  hours but im patient enough to just start it back up again
im sure this will be fixed in a patch in the futurethis game has bugs you might want to wait until the game gets more stable before you buy it
while most bugs are mild some are medium to spicy
the worst one involved the game not responding when i clicked on any inventory items to use them but restarting the game fixed itmaybe a bit too unlinear for some for those that like to be guided in a game you might find yourselve lost
some people have to have a answer to the question what do i do in this gamei got over those problems the minute i fell into the world of vvardenfell
there is a main quest in this game and i encourage you to follow it but take a break from it and do one of the hundreds of side quest to get some good money
you can kill anyone you want but if a guard sees you kill a innocent
you will be under arrest at which you can either pay a fee go to jail or resist arrest and start killing everybody
the choosing is up to you
sorry im going back to playing the game
bye everybodyi really want to rate this at  stars but there are just enough small complaints to keep me from doing so
morrowind is simply the best rpg ive played since ultima vii
i compared it to ultima ix since that attempted and failed miserably to create a fully realized huge d world
bethesda has done everything right
ive played for at least  hours now and am moving along at my own pace without feeling pressured to go faster
im sure if i kept solely to the main storyline and drove to the finish i could be done in a few days but that would completely ruin the best aspect of the game to immerse yourself in its immensity and complexity
what other game has ever tried to integrate so much into making it a unique experience for everyone who plays
want to be a studly fighter and whack everything who comes around
go ahead
just be ready to pay the price if youre caught slashing the wrong guy
dont like buying potions from the stuffy mages and shops
brew your own
off the shelf magic weapons too dull
enchant and create your own
want to utterly ignore the games primary quest
go right ahead
you can just about spend a game playing eternity just wandering and exploring
bethesda wisely put something of interest almost everywhere you go so there arent many dull stretchesthere are a few bugs though fortunately i havent run across any that crash me to the desktop
once and only once did it die utterly
the patch is absolutely essential howevera few ive run into are quest bugs that resulted in discussion topics not showing up or items not being there when they should have been
even so they dont detract from my desire to keep playing and thats how i define a bug as minor
i dont have a bleeding edge machine p  mb ram geforce  but i have no framerate problems  fps at x distance slider around halfway
i think the folks with uberhighend machines should learn how to do a little tweaking or else lower their expectations a tad
i certainly wouldnt trash the game over a couple hesitations here and therei really thought id be tired of it after playing so long im not
for that alone i happily give it both a value for money rating and a fun rating of pros the little thingsmushrooms on trees different architectural styles readable and occasionally interesting
books
the graphics are wonderfulcons land movement can be annoyingly slow given the long distances its sometimes necessary to crossoh and those cliff racer things should be grounded
i cant think of a single more irritating facet of the game than constantly and i mean constantly having to whack those aerial menaces away while moving around in the hillsthe playablity in mw is excellent but there are a few problems
even the highest end machines will have slow frame rates and choking issues my current graphics card is a ti geforce and my machine still stutters
also the hand to hand aspect of the game is a disappointment
it is ridiculously better to be a sword totting oaf than a speeding monk
finally if you like to play as a majic user you will find the spell system to be delightfully flexible
however you have to rest in order to regain your magicka this means mages are more prone to nap than a  month old child
yet the sheer size and freedom offered in morrowind is a fresh breath of air
you can do almost anything and become almost anyone
the options are truly mind boggling
i dont know of many games that will let you continue to play even after you have ruined the plot but mw does mw will promptly notify you of the doomed state of the universe and then ask you if you would like to continue to play in your now lost world
this game is well worth the money just be warned that it still has some minor draw backsmorrowind is basically a world
if you can think of something youd like to do in morrowind chances are theres a way to do it
jump from a rain barrel to a rooftop to escape pursuing guards
poke around in the bushes outside of town and discover a hidden crypt filled with ghouls
paddle out into the ocean fire an arrow at a giant jellyfish and hightail it back into town so the militia will protect you
there is a lot of fun to be had in this entirely d world
that said of course there are some rather serious bugs that still havent been corrected  the most egregious ive encountered is the disappearing item bug
basically things in your inventory simply vanish
sometimes its so minor you never notice
other times its a gem worth  gold
then you notice
at first i just assumed my naive th level guy was just a constant victim of pickpockets
then the suit of chainmail he was wearing simply vanished while he was walking down the middle of an empty road
i reversed course back into town and tried to buy another one from the local guard
since i had joined the imperial legion no one would talk to me since i was now out of uniform
finally i found a nonlegion shop that carried legion chainmail bought a suit and put it on
the game crashed
reloaded tried again
game crashed again
finally i just gave up on either being in the legion or ever having a legionnaire npc ever talk to me again still out of uniform  ranged combat is bizarre
for anyone used to st person shooters using a bow and arrow and crosshairs to peg a target shouldnt be too challenging but it still requires some coordination and timing particularly when that target is trying to sneak up and kill you
however its not enough to simply line up something with your bow and shoot it
you have to also hit it with your stats
so if your character is bad with a bow you can fire longbow arrows directly through peoples heads on screen and not hit them
doesnt matter how big and lumbering the target is if your stats say you miss you miss even if you see that arrow go right through its chest  if you start the game and just barter with the first shopkeeper you find for about an hour youll soon be able to turn a huge profit just selling him back the items you buy from him
so whenever you need money you can just swap the same expensive item back and forth a few times to clean out the house
then you can use the money to just train yourself up levels  unpredictable npcs
a lot of the time fairly innocent things will turn npcs aggressive
on the plus side the guards will usually let you go with a minor feebribe but it can get annoying fast particularly when all the npcs are linked so that if you irritate one someone on the other side of town somehow magically senses it and runs over with their axe
a classic example is opening a chest  floors above any npc then heading downstairs into a swirling pack of angry people
then when you kill them all youre the bad guy hehall in all its a visually stunning game that can prove to be very frustrating in play
i find i can only take it for an hour or two at a timeok lets get to the point
this game doesnt even come close to games like doa or vf
however if you are just throwing away your controller down after playing the first match then you are not really looking into this game deeply enoughok lets say if i were on a blinddate and my date is this really ugly girl  what should i do
should i just tell her that shes fat and ugly and i have no interest whatsoever so have a nice day
or should i at least see if she has a good personality
if you were on a blinddate with one thing in mind to have a steamy date with a hot babe then its unfortunate that you met this ugly girl
however if you dont mind the outer appearance and are looking for something substantial then give yourself some time and you will see shes not that bad after all
not bad after allof course doa is way hotter than kabuki warrior however if you spend some quality time with kabuki warrior you will see that she got something to share with you
if you have played the game through the end and have played the versus with friends knowing all the moves combosyou are asking me combos
yes believe me theres several combos you can do in this game surprised
 this game is tight when it comes to game play reallyyou know niki was a really hot girl yet she was highmaintanenceexpensive and arrogantok because of her implant didnt last that long with herhowever with martha to whom i felt very comfortable withlook at the price
 gave me more of what i really wanted gameplay afterallif you are looking for a d game for xbox and looking for something simple enough yet gets deeper to play with your kids this would be an excellent choice
please dont judge this game with  min
of your playing timeget to know her manyour first strike wins the crowd your final strike wins the battle
as a fight promoter for a troop of kabuki warriors trying to travel from edo to ktoto your actorsamurai must possess both strength and style
along the way you will have to fight other kabuki troops garner the crowds favor to recieve tips and trade warriors with your defeated counterparts
you will need a very accomplished group of samurai when you arrive in kyoto to defeat the citys star troop
fight warriors in winner takeall competitions on stage across japan
pummel opponents and strike dramatic poses to gain the crowds favor
twentyfour characters with different weapons and unique attacks like fireballs fire storms lightning and tornadoes
i urge you to rent this game before you buythe screen is a great little gadget to have in the car or if you are board in a hotel room
the screen is small but good enough to make out a oneplayer game
it is almost impossible to play with  or  players in a split screen game
the lcd screen comes with a car adapter for the game cube a power spliter which divides the power cord so that the monitor and the gamecube are powered a quotyjackquot so that two people can listen to the game via the headphone port and a videoaudio input cable which connects to the screen
the screen can get blurry at times so it is not the best for a fastpacedaction game
the stereo sound on the monitor is great
the major flaw though is that the caradaptercable can only be used on the gamecube and not on any other system
you can still use the xbox or other systems with it it just has to be near a ac outletthis moniter is pretty cool it fit on top of your cube it comes with an two headset adapter power pack a car adapter that powers both game cube and the moniter and an adapter to hook up other consoles
its back lit so you can play in the dark you can adjust the brightness level it also has two speakers that go very loud
the only negative is that in some games the action get kind of blurry also you have to be close the see smaller things i would recommend because what next gen system you could take it on the road and play heck thair too big anyway loli myself have not bought the screen but one of my friends has
my friend and i went camping with our dads and they hogged the tv the whole time
i had no idea of what to do until myy friend pulled his moniter out
the graphics were pretty good and the sound was good too
we even played the cube on the way home
a very good productthe reason you will see such variation in the reviews here is because the screens are made of recycled parts
its kind of hit and miss but i was lucky
the chic monitor easily snaps on the game cube and amazingly still allows wavebird recievers to be used provided you plug them in after the screen goes on
connecting it is as easy as with any another tv you just connect the included specially short av plug directly to the gamecube
then you plug the provided car adapter in one to the lighter the other end to the monitor and the other to your cube
turn it on and bam
there you are
it also includes a headphones splitter a screen ac adapter to play at an outlet overall the screen clarity is pretty good for what i had been expecting
it did need to be centered using the gamecube menu screen align but it was still pretty good looking
there was a small splotch a little smaller than a pencil eraser that had slightly different brightness but i think i only noticed it because i am used to my hd wega
it definately was no reason to return it
the sound is very good but its no home theater system
overall its going to la on my trippicture resident evil without the static backgrounds better graphics and a truly terrifying atmosphere and you have silent hill  for the xboxthe one thing this game does very well is its ability to create a tense terrifying and suspenseful mood
you never quite know whats around that corner or whats waiting for you at the end of a dark hallway
believe me the shock moments are well executed in this game and will startle you on more than one occassion
walk by an abandoned car and suddenly a shrieking zombie comes skittering out from underneath it
the sense of dread and fear you get when you run down the end of a dark hallway hoping to find an exit door only to see a zombie standing in the darkness slowly fading into view as your flashlight illuminates the area in front of you is enough to make anyone tense up with genuine fear
moments like these are what make the game so greaton its own sh is just a simple d puzzleexplorationfindtheitem gamebut because youre always in a tense state as you perform trivial tasks like searching a room etc not knowing what will jump out at you the games rating instantly goes up to a  out of the game is relatively hard the first time around as some of the puzzles are ridiculously obscure
but the difficulty can be adjusted separately for the puzzles and main game itself
but you owe it to yourself to play the game on normal or hard first
as an added bonus theres an extra scenario only for the xbox so we xbox owners truly benefit
interesting game and one that will hold you over until halo  and shenmue ii come outthis is a very good game for the xbox amoung other systems
the graphics and fmv sequences are well done and move the story along well
when i started playing this it was a bit spooky for me but i warmed up to it
in full  digital sound mode the sounds come from everywhere and can unsettle you a bit
the violence level is really not that bad i mean you are fighting ghouls not people and it is not the main funtion of the game
the game is a puzzle and on moderate levels not an extrodinarily hard one but it will take you quite a while to get through it
you will not be disappointedinitially i was disappointed with this port when i bought it
the graphics seemed worse than its ps counterpart in part because the xboxs power made the flaws more glaring and obvious
that is until i discovered the noise filter by complete accident
somehow the knowledge of this feature had slipped me
once i turned the noise filter off the graphics became leaps and bounds better than the ps  version
everything about this game is better on the xbox
im surprised konami even bothered with the noise filter when the game looks so much better without it
im now glad i got this version over the ps  version of the game and am eagerly awaiting silent hill  which promises to tie the other two games together to give us the answers the fans have been waiting for what on earth is going on at silent hillthe story for sh remains largely untouched aside from the additional side scenario born from a wish which in my opinion doesnt ad anything of value to the over all story although it does establish that maria and mary really were two different people which raises the question of who was the final bossthere was a huge surprise toward the end of the main game that i didnt expect i never finished the ps  version and it was greatly appreciated as there are far too few plot twists like it
i wont blow it for those who havent made it all the way through the gamei must confess that there were a couple of times that i got scared or just creped out
for instance in the prison with the loud foot steps above james and a deep booming voice calling out for someone named ishmael or richile or something like that
i was very paranoid in that room because i was certain i would be attacked by something huge that would take a lot of bullets to kill something bigger than the pyramid head who was perhaps the most disturbing creature of the gamewile the story remains deep and well thought out it is not as deep as the original
this game gave me no clue to what is happening at silent hill
was this game happening at the same time harry mason was trying to find his daughter or after
if it is after since the demon samiael is dead why is silent hill still suffering the effects of his summoning
while it answers none of the questions about the town itself that i have at least in the main plot and documents that i found the story has a very strong cast and a plot that develops each character appropriately
you feel for james until the end and you feel for angela etc
the voice acting in this game is also stellar and very real
the biggest surprise was how laura sounded so much like a real eightyearold girl
usually the voice acting for child characters is terrible but not here
the game also features some of the best fmv sequences ever and the game flows from real time to fmv very smoothly although the colors were a bit pale and the real time graphics suffered some antialiasing and edge enhancement issues but otherwise looks brilliant
i was especially impressed by this games light sourcing
once that noise filter came off this game looked almost as good as gamecubes resident evil
for those that dont have the ps  version and those who have missed this game be sure to pick it up
just be warned it is nowhere near as terrifying as the originalthis game chilled me to the bone all the way until the end
i literally had to have my roomate stay in the living room and watch me play the game because i was afraid to play alone
this game so far is the scariest game ive ever playednow for the downsides  camera angles are choppy boss fights or any fight is clumsy and the storyline is cryptic much like most japanese storylinesbut overall worth the playthis game is different from the playstation version
it has an extra side mission where you can play as maria
the only way to get this on the ps is to get the greatest hits versionthis game has  standard endings and two strange outthere endings so replay value is relatively highkeep in mind the game was made years ago so the scares arent as extreme as fatal frame for example but it gets better towards the endsilent hill is one of the most eeriest game you will ever play
my only tip is play it with somebody and have the lights on
 konami gave the xbox owners some extras with the game an xboxexclusive extra episode in which you play as mary the wife of the main character
even with the extra episode it may not be reason enough to buy it for xbox if you have played it in ps but it will extend your playing time for about  hoursyou play as james sunderland a man who comes to silent hill after he receives a mysterious letter from his dead wifemary asking him to meet her there
when you finally get there you notice that there is something very wrong it is up to you to find out
as usual you will be spending most of the time solving puzzles but along the way killing tons of zombietype creatures which rarely is a challenge noteenemy ai is 
one thing i like about the game is the mapping system it will help you alot since you will know what areas you have missed along the way if you get stuckthe graphics and sound of the game is definitely been refined for the xbox version
the creatures in silent hill  sound as scary as they look but their ai is something to be worked on
all in all a great game and worth the fifty bucks you will be buying it for if not rent it
for parents out there this game is not for kids even a year old gamer like me gets nightmares from this gameintroductionfrankly i can careless for another resident evil game
the series has become quite sigh tiresome
the original silent hill was a fresh clever and wellproduced introduction to the survival horror genre
the success of the first installment is evident by the amount of websites devoted to explain the game i have even read master degree thesis material meticulously dissecting all aspect of sh
with silent hill  restless dreams konami once again bring us back to relive the perpetual nightmare and marvel at the beauty of this phatasmgraphics the game is just depressingly beautiful
the artistry for creating the background environment and effects lighting water reflection textures is perfect and effective
character models are done extremely well
while the graphics cannot really show off the power of an xbox i have nothing to complain aboutsound music is adequate
it stays true to the common theme of silent hill
scores composed with minor keys will just make you depress
now the sound effects are just damn creepy and insanely stressful
i want to run out the house and scream after hours of constant tortune by those minddisturbing scratches and indiscribable hellish crys and moansgameplay basically plays like any other adventure or survival horror game except with better control than the re series
hmm the puzzles are ok nothing really clever or spectacular but i am too scared and engrossed that i overlook that aspectpresentation all i can say is you may leave silent hill but silent hill never leave you
in my restless dreams i do dream of silent hilllasting appeal unless i own the game and i have no other games to play or i am a diehard sh cultist i really doubt i am gonna replay the game
i do not want to endure those depressing and stressful experience again after i have uncover the truth the ending
however it does have  different endings to try and you can train your skills on harder settingsclosing commentsthe darkest and most depressing game for any platform ever
overall i give it a  if you are easily disturbed by horror graphics skip this
if you are adventurous and curious do yourself a favor and let silent hill imprison your soul for a while you might escape from that place feeling glad that you are alivenot much to do
the zombies are starting to come around though and its getting much betteryoure this guy who hadhas a girlfriend who maymay not be dead
she got quotthat damn diseasequot a few years ago and supposedly died of it
but weeks later you recieve a letter from her saying to meet her at your quotspecial placequot silent hill
so the question isis she still alive
oh yeah everyone else in town who had quotthat damn diseasequot turned into a flesheating zombie who tries to kill youstrong language gore and graphic violence earn this an quotmquotok this is my first review on any console game and the reason i feel compelled to write anything is because i can not get this game out of my head
i have only had an x box for about  motnhs and besides halo and harry potter i havent found much i liked in the way of x box game
i start out by saying i am a beginner with console game so my review relects thisit was only after reading a vague review in the x box mag that i found an interest in this game
so one friday night at my video libray i saw it and rent it
i entered this world called silent hill and didnt come out of it till the sunday
now here are the factsthis game is not an action game  its a interactive horror movie find a walkthrough or cheats on the net cause at times the puzzles can be frustrating play this in the dark with sound up  this is a must
 dont expect a happy ending that wraps everything up  but hell it will make you think for days to come unless you scare easily or are under  this game shouldnt scare you but it does give of a vibe of unease expect to take your time with this game  you could easily finish this game in just under  hours but u will not want to finish once yah into it so u will need the time to get there and  hours in one sitting is still alot of time yes there is fog over everything but it help towards the mood of the game and to be frank the graphics at times though a bit grainy add to the horror element
it really is like watching some old episode from the twlight zone but creeppppythe cut scenes are almost dvd quality and really add to the movie feel of the game all characters and voices are spot on and you really end up engaging with the storyline much easier because of this it will play on your mind for days after wouldthe only negative is as most have said the controls
but try to stick with it
after an hour you really will get the knack of itbasically i loved this game
it offered everything i expected and more as a horror fan
i was actually interested in the storyline and was able to get creeped out a few timesif u want a horror interactive experience buy this
if u want straight up action avoid itand if you see maria tell her im looking for her pnote in australia this game is called silent hill  inner fears have no idea whyi just bought this game  at my local game stop
i played it for about an hour it was not very exciting at the start but once i got into silent hill it was very freaky 
there was fog every where and i walked down the street and there was blood marks where it looked like someone had been draged down the street and there was a monster so i follwed it 
it was hard and freaky cause the whole town is covered in fog which is a really good effect 
you cant even see the monster until your right next to them 
the monsters  are not very freaky its the music and town that freak you out
the graphics are beautiful  on the xbox 
the fog looks so real 
so if you own and a xbox and love horror games then come visit silent hill ok so i got this in the mail when i got home from christmas
i popped it right in the xbox to see what all the creepyhype was about
right off the bat it was obvious this game is older than splinter cell etc
you cant look all around and the movement is a little outdated
after sitting through a lot of story scenes i finally found the entrance to meeting up wsome scary stuff
it was creepy
the sound design is fantastic and the movement of the zombies is good and disturbing
i needed some help from the internet finding some of the clues and solving some of the riddles but its pretty interesting
i imagine ill be spending more time wthis gamethis game owns me
its fastpaced and the combos are completely unsane
thats right unsane
the only drawback is that it has no endings
the characters are funny and the action is sick
ever wanted to be a  little girl capable of weilding a  lb
boat anchor or a faceless assassin with a magic pool stick
if so this game is your sick twisted nightmare come truesit down plug in shut up and play
guilty gear x is the classic for the millineum guilty gear x could be the nicest looking d fighter ever no doubt
the gameplay is fast paced the graphics are superbits almost like youre watching an anime and the sound is pretty cool too except for the announcer
the only drawback though is that there are no endings
why in the world did they not include endings
also the loading times can take a bit at times certainly longer than in capcom vs snk  but not long enough to the point where you feel like tossing the controller at the tv screen at most  seconds in some battles but most load in less than  seconds
the special kill move is cool but if you execute it on time and without missing your opponent you could have him beat with two or three hits
i recommend this game for any d fighting fans when i bought it i just looked at  the back of the case i had never seen or heard about this games so i picked it up and i liked it
even my friend told me it was a cool game
had this game been compresed on a dvdrom it would have been that much better but it is still a mst own titlethe sequel guilty gear x hit shelves
this feels like an un full version of ggx
dont bother with this one
just get the sequel
it is the best d fighter everthe first time i played this game i wasnt sure of what to think of but once i started to play more often i knew it is good
it has a non traditional soundtrack usually fighting games just have keyboard music which isnt bad but this has guitars bass and drums
it has the sound of the early days of metal
i especially like how the name of some characters moves make referance to metal bands
the graphics are clear and vivid
the bosses are cheap just the way i like em nothing like a good test of your skills
there arnt that much characters but it is made up by the crazy designs of the characters there attributes and there storylines
this game also has fast gameplay but not as fast as the marvel vs capcom series but it  is almost there
and if you are experienced in d fighters the special moves are no problem
there is so much to say about this game but i like to keep it short
what i am basically saying is that this game is a good nod to the old schoolhaving never played dynasty warriors  i was able to pick up dynasty warriors  and take an objective look at it
i have seen complaints of it being just the same game with a few more characters and stages
but then again arent most sequels the same game with a few more characters and stages
i do however agree that koei needs a new angle though as the quotthree kingdomsquot are becoming quite oldgraphically the game is on par with other ps titles
while you wont see any groundbreaking visuals you wont see any ugly glitches either
the animations all have a fluid motion and many of the fighters are fun to watch as they pull of their moves
the enviroments have some details but is basically nothing more than ground to fight on
dont expect to be bouncing off walls or hiding under bridges
there is however some popup as well
it seems that the game can only handle a certain number of characters on screen at once so very often you will see soldiers appear out of no where or vanish into thin air
but the soldiers closest to you are always visible so this never really becomes a game hindering problemthe gameplay is where dw truly shines
while a nice variety of characters is already offered from the first time you turn on the game those initial  characters will turn into a list of 
playable characters as you progress
each character has a different weapon and fighting style
although some characters are quite similar you will notice certain differences
for one most characters have an individual look to them that seperates them from the othersanother aspect of gameplay that really makes this game shine is the ability to build your characters
as you fight either in free mode or mosou mode your character will gain experience and be promoted through the ranks
you will also find numerous statboosting items on the battlefield when slaying certain enemy officers
each character has four weapons which can be found somewhere in the game the fourth being a unique and extremely powerful weapon
but with a little bit of time youll be able to build your normal character into somewhat of a god on the battlefield
another great thing is that any items found with one character can be used with all charactersthe game does however have some really really annoying flaws
one of my biggest complaints is the menus
youll notice that once you make your decision you have to either stick with it or reset the console
there is no quotback buttonquot on any of the menus
while this might seem minor it will frustrate you quite a bit when you select the wrong mode by mistake and have to resetyoull also learn to hate the saving system in the game
the ability to save during a battle is great since many things you just dont ever want to have to deal with again but the process of saving during a battle is absolute torture
youll have to pause the game and select quotquitquot which brings up a prompt to quotquit and savequot
now youre back to the main menu
your game has been saved but if youd like to go back to playing you have to reload the game and wait for everything to boot back up
once again it sounds minor but itll have you wanting to kick the playstationthe biggest plague on this game however is the horrible voiceacting
the lines are spoken with no enthusiam whatsoever and most of the cutscenes actually hinder the gameplay rather than get you more excited
id actually advise putting the voices in japanese and just reading the english subtitles it helps make the story more exciting
although i have to wonder why there is no chinese dialog
i highly doubt that english and japanese were spoken in nd century chinaalthough koei is known for their strategy games that element is almost nonexistant in dw
while you might be a general on the battlefield you can never really command your troops
in fact you can run in a completely opposite direction from them and abandon them altogether
you are sometimes given specific orders of where to attack but you never have to follow these orders if you dont want to
basically youll just be running around hacking away at whoever you wish
and no matter what the game tells you you are all alone on that battlefield
also dont believe that hype about the elephants
there is only  out of  battlefields where elephants are present
and while riding them is fun it hardly constitutes a feature that should be mentioned repeatedly and praised so dearly
it just doesnt happen enough to matterso why do i give it  stars
bottom line the game is fun and it has very high replay value
with  fighters  battlefields a slew of weapons and items and the ability to build your characters and move them through the ranks this game will have you playing for weeks
the enemy ai is great as enemy officers block pull off combos and even use special moves
and while the game might seem like a button masher which it kinda is there are combos you can pull off and fighting strategies you can use if you actually want to learn how to play
sure the menus are annoying and the voices are the worst ive ever experienced in a video game but dw has a lot of depth and is extremely enjoyabledynasty warriors  shinsangoku musou  is a great fun action game  perfect for blowing off steam or killing timedynasty warriors  was a cool game when it came out but like a lot of first gen ps games it was over too soondynasty warriors  has much more staying power
it is a great improvement over the   for example now you and your buddy can team up split screen and work together to kick butt and strategize
for those of you who enjoyed the psx jedi power battles and the coop style there you will love thisdw isnt smart and funny like metal gear solid  the only game i can think of that deserves  stars  but it is a very enjoyable game
definitely buy it  if you rent it youll miss out on a lotlast note  i dunno why this game is so hard to come by
limited release
if you get your hands on it its worth the list price new  but finding it used for money would probably be a good findbasically its like gauntletjedi power battlescommand and conquer all rolled into one
you fight epic battles where you pretty much singlehandedly demolish hundreds of enemy troops thats why youre a hero heroes do that you know
but unlike games like gauntlet you can chose where on the battle map you want to concentrate your attention fighting
for example if one of your ally generals is about to fall he will issue a warning and you can either allow him to get slaughtered or you can rush to his aid
allowing him to die results in the diminishing of the overall moral of the troops which in term translates to a reduction in fighting abilityfighting is with very simple button sequences which are pretty much the same with every character
during the course of the game you collect items that improve your characters performancethe plot in the game is based on the three kingdoms also availabe on amazon a well known chinese novel
i think this is the first time a video game might actually encourage someone to read a book
actually kessen is also based on the same story surprise koei also makes the kessen game
unfortunately whatever the story is amongst these kingdoms its completely incomprehnsible in the game
but thats really not important anyway as jumping in and killing lots of people pretty much gets you through all the game campaignspros simple controls to master provides light strategy that is manageable in the thick of a battle can switch to japanese mode so the characters speak japanese
sounds cooler at least graphics are goodcons game gets a bit repetitive major hand pain from stabbing the game controller buttons for too long
a campaign can last as long as  minutes awefully stilted english voice acting rock sound track does not really fit with the theme of the game
needs more of a gladiator or lord of the rings soundtrack in the gamethis was the first ps game i ever bought back in june  i had played a  minute session of dynasty warriors  on an official us playstation magazine demo disc and loved it
it was so addictive it was a pure adrenaline rush of video game excitement that you usually only find in d action games
the actual game proved to best just as intoxicating
i still play it to this day even though the game is  years old
im not the slightest bit tired of itin dw you take control of a warrior from one of three warring factions in ancient china and fight in battles with the other factions in a quest to unite china under your rule and yeah this actually happened in real life  years ago
the battles take place on huge maps with hundreds upon hundreds of soliders in which your goal is to generally kick the crap out of anything that comes near you with your weapon of choice and lead your army to victory
its like a rts game except youre actually controlling an individual fighter instead of watching from some sort of godchair
its not as depthless as it sounds either
the combat has a large variety of normal and special attacks as well as bow  arrow and horse combat
theres also some  player modes coop and versus and endurance and time attack minigamesand with  
memorable characters to play as each with different fighting styles and hilarious quotes as well as  levels with different sides for each the replay value is nearly unparalleled
ign couldnt have said it better when they told us years from now youll still be popping this game in regularlythere are several technical problems that hold this back from a perfect score though theres a high amount of fog and slowdown i suppose this is because of how many units are on screen at once the cooperative mode which is fun as well makes the aforementioned problems even worse and the procees you have to go through to find your characters th ultimate weapon is so ridiculously specific that its literally impossible to do without looking at an faq or a list of cheat codesi dont think that detracts from the fact that the game is beyond  stars in terms of fun
if youve ever been curious about this series buy dw first
dw and dw may be more impressive in terms of presentation and graphics but none of them have that magical nostalgic that you get after playing 
i defeated an officerdynasty warriors  is unlike any console game i have ever played
intense battlefield level action accompanied by some beautiful graphics really make this one an eye catcher
as you  slash your way through  stages youll find yourself glued to your playstation   yet as addicting as this game is its not without its own flaws which unfortunately hold it back from becoming a real contenderon the positive side dynasty is an adrenaline fueled hack n slash adventure in which you experience first hand glorious battle with your fellow comrades
as far as im concerned nothing beats charging at  enemy soldiers with your men behind you i often found myself yelling to motivate my soldiers
with over  warriors to choose from most have to be unlocked youll find yourself with plenty of new things to do
the game modes range from musou which is similar to a campaign mode all the way to endurance which pits you against  enemy troops to see just how long you can lastunfortunately the time has come for me to point out some things i had problems with
first off game slow down is a very real factor and though its not a common problem it will happen from time to time especially when there are too many troops on screen
in game announcements become repetitive and annoying after about one mission hearing your general say your better than i have heard
every  minutes can put you on edge a bit
enemy ai also proves not to be the smartest thing in the world dont be too suprised when you sneak up on an enemy troop running into the wall
the japanese to english translation is sometimes laughable especially during cutscenes when characters mouths are so incredibly out sync but that doesnt really affect the game i suppose
finally game play is a bit shallow and while there is some strategy involved it mostly just involves picking the right route to attack your enemy frombut dont take that previous paragraph to seriously this is all and all a fun game
the replay value is very high and multiplayer mode is entertaining and helpful especially during hard missions
if your looking to experience sword to sword face to face intense battle then this is your best betwhat a very odd game this is
designed i believe to hone the skills of the indifferent typist with drills where demons are destroyed when you correctly type the words floating over their heads
it sounds like a good thing for the kids huh
no not really
the level of typing expertise required to win is phenomenal
im an excellent typist  wpm and i only rated a b
i beg your pardon
its not suited to someone just learning to type beginning touchtyping section notwithstanding and its much too frustrating for kids on the other hand if you already know how to type and just want a good excuse to make yourself practice this is your babyvoice acting is hysterically bad sound effects are deafening plot is nonexistent graphics are okay but nothing to write home about and theres only six levels
so why is it so addictiveand who said typing cant be fun
i found the typing of the dead to be a pretty entertaining way to improve typing skills
it can be difficult at times being that theres a lot going on but once you get into the game you can play it for hours
the typing of the dead is a typing version of the arcade game the house of the dead
instead of having a gun as your weapon your weapon is the keyboard
the faster you type the more zombies you take out
type words before the zombies can attack you otherwise the next grave you see is your very ownthe game is equipped with different modes
one of my favorites is the boss mode where you get to select any boss you want and see how fast you can take them down
some you only have to type single words while others you have to type full sentences
theres also a drill mode that comes equipped with games to help you on accuracy speed reflexes and more
there is also story mode arcade mode and training mode
while this is a fun way to improve typing skills id only recommend this to people who already know how to type
this isnt the best program for beginners since theres so much going on
it could be very difficult for beginners even on the very easy level
im not saying that no beginners should try it just saying that i think it might be tougher for those who are just learning to type
but this is a great tool for those of us who already know how to type but want to improve
its very easy to use and install
the typing of the dead is an amusing typing program that can help you improve your typing ability and allow you to have fun at the same time
its got neat graphics and a neat concept
this is something i will be playing with for a while
plenty of things for you to experience on this fine cdromin  littleknown development house id software released what would be one of the most influential action games of the s
that game was not doom but wolfenstein d
although primitive by todays standards wolfenstein d was revolutionary when it was released and was indeed the obvious precurser to such greats as doom half life and system shock graphics   what was incredible back in  is pretty lame  years later
there is only a handful of walltextures not even any outdoor environments the enemies are really just flat d sprites and the weapons dont look at all convincing
still when the game was released this was about as good as  color vga graphics got
thats worth a few points right theresound   sound doesnt play a very important role in wolfenstein d with the exception of the occasional lowquality sound sample of a guard giving orders
the gunshots are pretty boring and the music while well composed is repetitivecontrol and gameplay   there really isnt much to the control other than shooting nazis walking around shooting nazis picking up items and shooting nazis
theres no jumping or crouching due to the games  d nature no special action key etc
the levels consisting of a slew of rooms are well designed but very mazelike and youll eventually grow tired of their repetitive nature after about  levels
once again the games age is its excuse for such shortcomingsoverall   this score is a bit of a stretch since wolfenstein d definitely does not hold a candle to games like half life no one lives forever or even doom
but considering its historical significance and mostly solid if repetitive gameplay it gets a  star rating from me
if you can still find the old shareware version and are looking for a nice trip down memory lane id say wolfenstein d is definitely worth a look
just dont expect anything that hasnt already been done with countless other fpssin todays video game culture firstperson shooters reign supreme from the classic goldeneye of nintendo  fame to current titles such as halo and the call of duty series
there was a time early s however when this was not the case and it took one game to begin the revolutionwolfenstein dset in a prisonerofwar camp in the heart of nazi germany early s gamers were introduced to the fps genre in the form of one bj
blazkowicz and this single sentence you crouch over the guards body hoping that the others didnt hear his muffled scream
from there gamers were given almost total control of the character in order to complete each stage primarily accomplished by finding the elevator door after taking out room after room of nazi baddiesin hindsight the game had a few flaws primarily being the mazelike environment that turns some levels into nothing more than prolonged searches for keys to enter the locked doors as well as some levels that will test even the most patient of gamers with their enormity
but all told it was nothing short of revolutionary in its treatment of the video game platform
it even guessed right in using a wartime scenario to detract from some criticism the same reason why cod is so popular yet other fpss are so demonizedthus this game provided you have a computer old enough to run it or know how to install dosbox
really can be enjoyed by two different types of gamers  for nostalgic purposes and  for those who currently enjoy the genre to see how it all began and still play a heckuva game in the processthis is a fun game but the missions are repetitive and usually deal with doing some little thing in one area and warping to another until the end of the episode then warping to stb for supplies
combat missions are sometimes fun except for a few commands that dont get followed through
i think you should be able to steer the ship from the bridge not steer a model of it in tactical mode
i dont like odd camera angles
dont waste your money on the voice commander software the profile on this games cd does not workits corrupt and there is no place to download
i just put my own commands in but they hardly ever work either and it interferes with the gameplaying
i dont like headphones or having to wear them to use a miconly headset mics will work
playing it with the mouse and keyboard is more entertaining but you have to like st next gen to like this if you dont then dont buy the game
hopefully thier will be another judgement ritesfinal unity like game that incorperates the bridge command and driving the ship as well as away missions all in one game
flight simadventure why noti have been a trekkie for many years and this game immediately appealed to me
i think any fan of the show dreams about taking the big chair and commanding a starship and this game allows you to do just that
it is not perfect but it offers a very enjoyable experienceas far as the simulation goes this game does almost everything right
you can choose from a nice array of both ufp and alien ships in combat and each ship has its own way of handling
a few more would have been nice but there is enough to satisfy almost anyone
the ships handle just as they should  not as fighters but as capital ships
this means they are relatively slow so combat is more like a battle between two giants than a runandgun dogfight
while this may sound boring it actually makes the battles very strategic and complexthe singleplayer mode is good for the most part
it has a good story and some interesting situations
it is of course heavily focused on combat which can get a bit boring over time
it is also very linear though it offers a few choices once in a while
another problem is the inability to save at will
the game autosaves between missions but this can be a long time and many events can take place between saves that could require loading from the beginning of a section
for the most part though they are wellplaced and dont cause much of a problemthe multiplayer component is pretty good
it only allows manual control of the ship which may turn off some but overall makes sense
there are several different modes in which to play and integration with gamespy makes games relatively easy to find and join
you can also play over a local area networki would probably give this game  stars but i will round it up because of the great appeal it has to trek fans
it offers fans a chance to sit in the captains chair and offers those with little or no interest in star trek an engaging and welldesigned simulation
the singleplayer mode is fairly welldone and multiplayer should give this game lasting appeal
overall i feel it as least worth a look for anyone interested in star trek or in space simulationcombat gamesi just bought this game and it is really great
i was expecting it to be good since it was made by totally games the company that made a lot of those great star wars games
what was really a pleasent surprise was how quickly i was able to learn the user interface
using the mouse you interact with the bridge crew just point to a station and click the mouse
there are  federation ship types that you can command sovereign akula galaxy and another neargalaxy class sized shipjust like in klingon academy there is a skirmish mode where you can design your own battles
the only negative is that there is no joystick support that i can determine
the graphics and cutscenes are greatfor star trek fans this game is as good as they come
the fantasies of star trek fanatics who want to be in the captains chair to show picard that they can do it better will have there dreams come true with this game
i admit that i bought it with a little scepticism after reading other reviews and after playing on the demo but it has to be one of the most original games to come along in years
you play as the captain and you sit in the famous centre chair most of the time
you can always of course use a consol to zoom out and see the ship from the outside but thats the extent of your local manoeuvrabilitybut who needs manoeuvrability when you have warp drive at your disposalthere are two main modes of play
the story mode which is like a series of star trek where you go through different episodes and follow a story line which is half linear with decisions altering the outcome and this is the best mode
there is also a quick battle mode where you can play with teams in the chair in combat situations where you can take on klingons romulans cardasians etc no borg im afraid but bet you  bucks that will be an add on pack
the cool thing about it is that the teams are fully customisable so you can have you and  klingon warbirds stick two romulan warbirds if you like
you could also have a couple of star bases to defend or even take on ds in the old enterprisedalso in this mode there is no limit in the number of enemies or friendlies you can have and i mean that i did a test and had over  on each team and talk about slow downi have to say i have a duran  with mb ram and i can only have full graphics with four a sidespeaking of graphics the single player game runs fine on the above specs and so does the quick combat up to that point and boy are the graphics good
so photo realistic and with a sun in the sector the hull shines it back and looks great
the damage effects sell the combat to me though
no exaggerations when i say location damage
it really does depend on where you hit the ship as to where the damage is seen
and im not talking about those black smear marks you see
you get a quantum hit your hull with no shields and youll be seeing space through the gapthe damage effects are worth buying the game for alone
its fun to see how much damage you can do to the enterprisee before it explodesback to the bridge anywaythroughout the story mode you sit in the chair and command most of the important functions of the starship
the power distribution the level of alert the location the warping the speed the tactics like manoeuvres the position of attack to protect certain shields the type of weapons used the subsystem to target such as weapon array or engines the communication station the damage repair priority and the view screen position and zoom and more
of course your officers are consulted to alter these for you but you have the final wordthese are just some of your options when in command but the story presents some interesting decisions that have to be madethe story line is fantastic its really fluent and even through you may think that the mission where you have to stop asteroids from hitting a space station is a little done before youll realise why your doing it when the story unfoldspatrick stuart spelling not sure on plays the voice of picard and brent spinner does data which makes it even more believableso up to now the game is seriously worth buyingthe only down side and this is the only thing i found were the bugs
yes it appears as though we are the beta testers again and you can see texture tearing on the bridge which can ruin the atmosphere literally chucklea few other things such as people falling over when the ship is hit seem to never get up but thats solved in the patch you can downloadfinally the bridge effects its really cool when your fighting because your bridge sets on fire and shakes and sparks fly around and the control panels flicker your officers are screaming at you to do something about the damage and your tactical officer is always telling you how the shields are getting lowerto sum up  the game has brilliant replay ability with the quick battle mode the story line is better then some of the real episodes and the effects and atmosphere are as close to the real thing so far
if you like star trek youll love this if you dont maybe its one to missbridge commander would have been really stunning if it had come out before games like independence war klingon academy and dominion war
the game feels essentially like a merging of these  gameswhat is novel about this game is that you get a st person view from the captains chair
once that wears off mins the time it takes to play the demo the game doesnt seem to be very interesting
i am basing this on playing the instant action games after playing the intro storyline part of the gamepros of the game implementation appears good worked rightaway on my laptop graphics appears decent voice overs are good character rendering is ok basically there is nothing offensive about the gamecons of the game not a whole lot thats new commanding from the captains chair is cute until you really have to do battle then youre hunting for the short cut keys weak compared to other star trek games in terms of strategic componentsfinally a chance to actually captain a starship from where every captain should be the big chair
this game allows you to take command of different ships in the star trek universe and go on missions in an overly developing plot set after the dominion war
this allows for two modes of play one where you can sit back and watch the experience just giving basic orders or the other where you can actually fly and shoot using the ship your in command of
the story line of the game is wonderful and leaves you guessing each minute of the moment
the missions in the game are varied and allow for different parts of the ship to be used depending on the mission that youre in
plus two guest appearences from the tng series are also in here picard and data which both fit seemlessly into the plot line
however on the missions the constant fighting really can become tediusprosthe captians chairtwo modes of gameplaygreat storylineconsconstant combat becomes tediusok well i have to say this game isnt about kobe bryant to stop mentioning his name he is just on the cover deal with it
also stop comparing this game to nbak or k
i personally think k is better yes but these are  totally different games
this game deserves alot more recognition than it is getting anyone who has played any version of this title should see how much potential it has
the gameplay is a good and actually the players dont look that good compared to some other games yes in this case i will mention k
the dunks are crazy in this game but the graphics were a dissapointment for nintendo gamecube i thought this game looked kinda choppy
it reminds me a bit of playstation because the players arms and so look blocky
other than that i really think everyone who owns a gamecube and is a basketball fan should try this game out wheter you like or hate kobe bryanttake control of nba star kobe bryant and recreate all his moves
all the moves including the out of this world slams were digitized from kobe himself
this game is a must have
also another cool thing about this game is the fact that its pa announcer is none other than the lakers reallife pa announcer
when he yells kobes name after a basket and also shaqs name after a slam it feels like a game at staples center
talk about taking control
this is the best as it gets
this game also has an arcade mode which is  on  basketball
it also has a  point shootout
take control of three point hotshots like pat garrity reggie miller and the  point king peja stojakovic
after you win a championship with the lakers you can take control of the other teams in the league along with superstar players like tracy mcgrady kevin garnett chris webber gary payton and others
this game also has the grizzled vets like karl malone patrick ewing and his airness plus brash rookies like brendan haywood jamaal tinsley and eddie griffini really enjoyed this game for my nintendo  and now i enjoy it even more for my gamecube
the difficulty levels are accurate easy is very easy medium is more chalenging etc so you can really play at whatever difficulty youre in the mood for
the graphics are also very detailed and every players face in the game looks exactly how the actual players look
the only flaws are the commentaryyou cant do practice mode with your fantasy draft team and the season mode doesnt have an all star break where you can play in the all star game and have a three point contest other then that i would reccomend purchasing this
its alot better then nba live or nba streeti know the game may not have much to do but seasons are really fun and most basketball games may not have the seasons
the game is way better than most basketball games but not as good as nba street
nba courtside  has very real graphics
if you want a  realistic baskball game for gamecube you should buy nba courtside bgtosc are excellent games
excellent
but they have a few problems running on modern sound cards
audigy and phillips acustic edge
odviously phillips didnt make sound cards when these games were released and audigy certainly wasnt around
niether was the live
 for that matter  i hope this release includes some kind of patch to run on modern machines
if it doesnt i wont be buying it most anyone who would be interested in baldurs gate has a copyhopefully legit and rereleasing the already released is pointless unless it has improvements andor fixesreading many of the reviews it seems that most people have a problem with the way the game is played
rpg games arent shooters
there doesnt have to be action every  seconds to make it a good game
the most important aspect of a rpg to me is the character development hence what rpg stands for role playing game
dialouge options truly make your character whether she be an ahole a do gooder or just an evil bloke
the story line is far from linear and i find most people who cant handle a non linear story are usually quite inept at thinking outside the box which is a great way to play this game
it does take thinking to complete this game
if you dont like to think dont play a rpgand diablo is not a true rpg
great game but there is no real character development
you also have to remember that this game is based on dd
 the rules are practically all automated but knowing a bit about the world the weapons armor and all the pros and cons to each thing typically helps
a big sword isnt always the best weapon
if you die so easily in the later battles you arent really preparing your character right or you arent getting the right equipment
plus the further you get the harder it gets
that is typically true with all gamesor else what is the pointbaldurs gate was one of the first really great rpgs i played many years ago
for a game of the time period it had pretty good graphics and a great engine for playing
the combat system i thought was a fairly good idea
turn based but still in real time with the all amazing pause key
the story line is fantastic and to this day i think it is probably one of the best thought out story of a game
the only fault i found with the game was the use of nd edition rules though that wasnt biowares fault since that is all they had at the time and the strange phenomenon of not being able to wear more than one magical item
as a dd player i know that isnt the real case
i figure they do it so you dont become too powerful but it isnt true
minor but a little annoying
the expansion set is a great idea but that is why i gave it four stars instead of five
i thought that durlags tower was a great idea but that part of the game alone can take longer than the actual game itself
that is an issue for me
yes the equipment is amazing but i usually find myself ready to quit by that point
the other parts of the expansion are kind of just out there
i felt like they are thrown in
if you play them while in the midst of the regular game they fit a lot better
dont just start the expansion if you bought it separately or else you have to the end battle all over again and it is harder
all the expansion quests are fun but the annoyance factor keeps it from getting a full five
i would give a  if i could but they dont allow half starsmy finace is not a gamer at all and she even likes this game
she is intrigued by the story enough that she wants to know what happens
it is a great game for late nights or just to get into a world that is totally different than our ownall right
one thing must be kept straight this game is addictive
i am glad i have a laptop so i can play it wherever i go
that being said now i must review this extreme monsterfirst things first this game is huge
i got this a long time ago and i still havent finished it but ive played enough of it to make a review out of it
the plot is a very good one nice and original
you probably know all the plot stuff already by reading all these reviewsbut it truly is the stuff that would make an english teacher scream with delightmaybe
combat is usually fun but it gets repetitive sometimes
fighting bosses is fun and sometimes they require skill to win
with the added expansion included in this it will be forever and a half until i finish iti really dont have much bad to say about this game at all but its not the best game ever thats why i did not give it  stars but you must play it if you like dampd andor rpgsbottom line play if you dare to lose contact with friends and family for a long timeshadow hearts  the best rpg youve never played
thats right
this largely unplayed and possibly unheard of game is extremely goodthe characters are really likable each one has depth and its easy to feel like you know them allthe story is extremely compelling and deep
full of twists and turns always keeps you on your toes and not knowing what to expectthe gameplay itself while short on hours is nonetheless great
the judgement ring system seems kind of rough at first but easily becomes second nature within an hour or so in
theres everything youd expect in a good rpg towns with shops and vendors hidden items everywhere weaponarmor upgrades random battles turn based combat etc
there is however no summoning instead the main character yuri can actually fuse with demons hes killed and become them
it works well and its pretty coolthe graphics are where the game falls short having been made for the ps originally looks very much like ff at least to me
the cutscenes and cgi however are still fairly good and the spell animations are bright and colorfulthe music is nothing short of awesome and really helps to set the mood of the dark storyi highly recommend this game to any lover of oldschool type rpgs namely the ffdragon quest series  but remember shadow hearts is unique at the same time and it doesnt try to be a ff clonewith that said  enjoyi was looking forward to playing shadow hearts  and i would have to say that i am  satisfied with it
its a hell of a lot better than most other ps rpgs like summoner for exampleand it has plenty to recommend it
firstly the story is pretty good and the characters are enjoyable to play with
even though the main two yuri and alice couldnt possibly be more cliched they have distinct personalities and yuris mysterious past and selfdoubts are given a new twist with the graveyard and malice elements of the gameso there is some originality here after all
the support characters are also interesting and funny especially margarete who seems to be a favourite of many reviewers shes a great sidekick sexy and sassy with some hilarious special attack movessecondly the graphics are very impressive
ok so its back to prerendered backdrops but the battle sequences are impressively staged in d with some really bizarre monsters plus some impressive special attacks from your characters
all of the characters have special signature moves with great animations and yuri can actually change into various monsters and use many special spells during battles
and then theres judgement ringah yes this is a great addition as you feel like you are at least called upon to use some skill in landing hits on the enemy
it provides just the right amount of extra challenge in my view
add to this the implementation of sanity pointswhich means that any battle that lasts for too long can send your weaker characters mad 
 and you have a battle system that stands up on its own in terms of innovative ideason the downside the game never gets particularly difficult
you always have plenty of curative power and preventative accessories which mean that a lot of the boss attacks can be easily thwarted
with a bit of dedicated levelling up theres not much chance of losing out in even the toughest battlesbut thats not to say that there are no challengesi would have to rank yuris lone battle against the seraphic radiance as one pretty hard encounter
however if you never got to that part i dont blame you as the other flaw in the game is that there are a large number of side quests and secret missions that are nighon impossible to uncover by accident
these are often hugely enjoyable and challenging such as the dollhouse and the cave ruins maze
to uncover yuris deepest darkest secrets and save him and alice from ultimate damnation requires some serious luck and detective work and it seems unfair to me that a casual gamer may miss out on a pretty large chunk of the story
that includes me by the way as i needed a walkthrough to work most of that out and i pride myself as being pretty thoroughstill on the whole this was a highly enjoyable game well though out with good graphics and a great soundtrack
i dont care about the historical innacuracies thats just nitpicking
i think its fun that margarete has a mobile phoneso if youre through with final fantasy x make this your next purchase
its shorter but still sweeti was fortunate enough to buy a copy of shadow hearts when it was first released in  and i was glad that i did
if it wasnt for the release of final fantasy x that same holiday season shadow hearts would easily have taken best rpg of  midways shadow hearts is a nice blend of irreverent wry humor wrapped around the usual apocalyptic storyline prevalent in most rpgs but the new twist this time is the heavy dose of horror and occultic themes
the ps rpg series persona tried this horrortheme rpg before but shadow hearts succeeds where persona almost does itthe storyline and especially the dialogue is funny but theres always a sense of horror just beneath it all
the horror is best shown in the art direction of city and dungeon levels
some of the scenes in shadow hearts practically oozes gore and splatter
the design of the creatures and bosses are pretty original and seem similar in form to the monster from the silent hill games
bodies of animals and people are put together as if by random
some monsters are nothing but a collection of legs put together
now that doesnt sound scary but the way its designed sure gives it an eerie and disturbing appearance
one stage pretty much details the aftereffects and potential continuation of mass childmurders
with the leftover eaten remains and gnawed on bones littering the boss fights lair
shadow hearts really isnt final fantasythe justice ring is a nice change of pace to the usual turnbased battle system used in most japanese rpgs
the battle system is still turnbased but every action outside of defending is affected on how well the player hits his mark on the justice ring
this keeps the player from just picking an action and seeing what happens
the justice ring system keeps the player involved throughout the whole battle
sometimes perfect use of the justice ring is a must to fight and succeed against certain bosses and situationsshadow hearts may not have the pedigree of the final fantasy series but this first game is a good start for midway to build their own successful rpg series
as long as they just continue to improve on the core successes that made the game so unique and fun then i see great things for this seriesas recommendedby someone else i played shadow hearts  first
shadow hearts would have been a lot tougher without knowledge obtained from the second game
using the rings for battle was a little tough at first but i caught on and had a lot of fun with the game
i liked the story line and the characters are bekievanle
some of the puzzels are tough
overall idint want to put the game down
its like a good book that you just couldnt put down
 at the young age of  i find most good rpgs are like that
i would  reccomend the shadow hearts series to anyone who plays rpgs
rpg gramps
im just starting shadow hearts when i frist seen this game i hesitated because the lack of a good rpg for ps but when i poped this game in it was a new experience the enviroment for this game is like no other rpg its like playing resident evil or slient hill in rpg form it dark and spooky unlike most bright and colorful rpg where used to
the graphics on this game are great it only falls short to one game final fantasy x it has great cg
the gameplay is fresh with a new battle system where you have this wheel every time youu attack use magic or items what you have to do is time you button pushes at a certin time on the wheel to execute a moer powerful attack so no more just pushing the button and watching what happens this system makes you feel a more a part of the game
the story seems great a cant maketo much of a comment since i havent cleard the game yet an i dont want to spoil anything
all in all this is the second best rpg on ps behind ff and should at least be rented if not purchesed ill give it a  cuz it still need some work to be a true classicshadow hearts is the story of yuri hyuga a young man with the mysterious ability to fuse with the spirits of monsters he defeats
he has been commanded by a mysterious voice to protect the life of alice elliot who saw her father torn apart in rouen france and is now fleeing for her life across mainland china
the world hangs in the balance as the great magicians of earth vie for their powers
spies and magicians young boys and vampires will fight at their side as this unexpectedly complex story unfolds for the player
set early in the japanese invasion of china just before world war i the scene shifts from the mainland countryside to shanghai prague rouen and englandmy initial reaction to the game was unenthusiastic
while not disappointing shadow hearts animation falls a bit short of what is currently state of the art for rpgs on the ps
it is a bit of a shock to switch from xenosaga or darkness hearts to a more typical standard for mainstream rpgs
in addition the story and characters get off to a slow start without the benefit if voiceover and cutscene continuity
the fighting system which uses an object called a judgment ring to determine the success of a strike takes a while to grow familiar
but if the player stays with the game and waits out the initial reaction gameplay becomes increasingly pleasurablealthough gameplay is linear the story itself is interesting with settings as varied as vampire castles and space ships
each player has an array of special powers from feng shui magic to bomb dropping planes as well as physical attacks
puzzles and mazes abound which keeps leveling up entertaining for most of the game
and gradually animation and the use of cut scenes and voice picks up so that the flow of the action becomes more and more engagingone of the reasons i like this game is its appeal to both sides of the player
the combat half of the game is fairly straightforward once you master what you can use and conquer the dreaded judgment ring
the addition of a set of puzzles to be worked out is a great plus
while these arent up to ffxs level they can keep your attention
finally this isnt the kind of game that tries to destroy the ego of the play
all the problems are surmountable with the application of persistence
i have hear rumors of a possible sequel and am looking forward to iti just beat this gameok first is it a horror game like m rating imlies
the introductory movie is certainly what you might call horror or black humor
the first level is moody and the second one is  i dont know whether to call it a taoist scary tale or something that will make you laugh like crazy
its something in between
there is one more ghost tale and thats it
game continues with lot of humor and great characterization and no  spooky stuff
system is like persona and bit like a materia system in final fantasy vii considering yuri only
main character tames demons and fictive beings and has ability to fuse with them get their appearance and powers just like you do in persona  except in persona  you dont become exactly that creaturepersona
other guys in game are typical you have normal attack and special one which drains magic points think spellspeople in game except yuri are your typical fighter white mage mage but they are well disguised by game designers in gun shooter priests daughter old chinese sage and so on
there is even funny female spy she doesnt have spells but she always calls her friends on the phone and then you see funny animation like drop of brick on opponents headwhat i dislike about game is that it goes linear with no backtracking required to progress  and after you defeat sub boss after long stairs who is really strong and after which you get movie you need to do quests all over map at old places and read faqs or guides because last boss is really too hard
spoilerswhen you fight boss after large stairs well that is just half a game
save itemsi built keith alice and yuri up to level  and took out alien meta god easily but i think you neednt do that
level  is ok because they will have ultimate spells but again more the merrier
for last fights you need  tera extracts and just   pure roots
if your characters hit hard  points or so there is no problem fight meta god with your melee weapon using third key and other keys if you are at level even if you miss some gravestones in china and asia you can get them all in europe after big fight that is not a boss fight but looks like onewhat you cant seem to get in europe is get erotic bookshanghai angels which you need to get best weapon and armor for yuri
pay attention about stone for getting fusion monster amon  you need that for best fusion monster for yuri its rock is in front stairs mentioned beforei must admit that some puzzles are ok and logical but game designer made it hard and bit illogical after sub boss fight
must readthere is extract shop in prague at the end of game
you need just  thera extracts and  pure roots for last bosses if you are levelyou have to wait for alice to get best magic  before it she doesnt have one good offensive magic before last onebe sure to have at least  crusifixes and three more bundles of leonardo bear cosmix and zodiac bracelet
get  pocket watches they are byableif you want good ending you have to read one of valuable items a book about in which order you beat masks
check faq for complete explanation
how do you challenge masks
well get malice to red and walk around without going to graveyard to beat malice
beat masks in order given in document
since they dont come in that order spare  minutes and wait till you meet first one  run away from others
when you kill first one wait for the second one and run away from first third and fourth when you meet them
the probability to meet all four in desired order is one out of  and thats why u runif you miss order in first fights kill all four in no particular order and then kill weakened versions in proper order
so to get good ending read book kill masks and go to graveyard to read alices tombstone
conclusionfun game in not so typical ambient for rpg  with sometimes illogical side quests but you can also build caracters in typical rpg fashion find cave and battle it out till you get cash and exp
i enjoyed it 
conclusionafter beating persona  shin megami tensei nocturne  digital devil both discs i must admit this game is real good and interactions between characters unforgetablea different kind of game  one that actually has a good story
i picked this game up on the recommendation of a friend and was she ever right
the game is great
while it took a bit to get used to the interface i was impressed by the overall storylinewhile the graphics are good its the story thats really is the high point of the game
it takes place in the victorian era  one with magic and evil plots and heroes
it really is an interesting twist on the fantasy rpg and thats what helped me through the gamethe graphics are good not great but good
they were enough to keep me entertained without boring me or slowing down the action
the only negative points i can say about the game are that it really isnt for younger kids  there are few overly violentgraphic images that may bother them
the other bad point is i needed to download a walk through for some of the more difficult strategiesfrom what ive experienced in this game it is rather a great game despite the slightly aging graphics
what holds you on for more is the actual storyline which can give you a good  hours of gameplayit may be a port from the dreamcast version but it still holds up rather well storywise like final fantasy and being fun is what its all about right
yeah graphics yeah story line those too can make a game worth it but just all around fun is another part of a game that can just make it good for those long endless halfmindless in this case really mindless leveling sessions a lot of people do with rpg characterspros a unique battle system thats enjoyable and unique
the skill system is very unique and works on a point system
customizing characters can provide for a whole new game experience and the development of new and interesting strategiescons the graphics are a little buggy two common combat glitches will occur half the time and the ps even slows down the performance just to handle the demand could have been reworked
the music gets on my nerves in a lot of places no uematsu or mitsuda sounds a lot like mega man legends
the voiceovers a great but there are too few of themthe battle system is a nice new gem that shines brightly
it involves several things
ok so you have a character and he progesses through this ip gauge based on his agility and speed
at the last quarter of the gauge comes the command point where the character enters a command
then he progesses to the action the end of the ip guage where he executes the command
this short stretch between com and act is used for spellcasting time or the time it takes to charge or prepare a technique
simpler commands like attack take hardly any time and the more you know the spell or skill the less time it takes
some skills can be mastered out so that they occur instantlythere are a who new set of commands for hte battle system which include defence evade combo good hits which hits for more hp damage critical a strong hit that cancles any command and knocks the target back in the ip guage hits for less hp than the combo and skills and magic and of course items
there is a chance to escape the battlethe skill ranking system works on three things xp skill coins sc and magic coints mc
the xp level up characters duh
the sc and mc are distributed among three more things  moves or character skills use sc and mana eggs magic containing eggs use mc
there are also skill books which can use either sc or mc
moves are personal character skills simple enough
mana eggs contain a list of spells that the character has access to if heshe has the mana egg equiped only one can be equiped at a time
the skill books are a list of skills that grant new abilities and attributes or up current stats and attributes like hp mp speed one grants evasion one grands counter attack
every entry in these eggs books or character moves has  ranks once filled up it is maxed out
some can take  coins for their final ranks while some are around the  markthen there are the items weapon armor headgear footing and accessory which can help modify your character
experimenting and mixing all these around provides for a great customization and ability to up your party to its potential
though you will see that certain characters fit certain roles and you just might end up not customizing them but advancing their natrual abilitiesthe story line is a little wierd and provides a few surprises along the way
the characters are smart in most places and dont do stupid things or not do the smart thing that could have prevented everything like if fate had only started explaining first instead of attacking then maybe serge would have listened and the dragons would have lost chronocross
it is a rather easy game and doesnt have much replay value excpet for customizing the characters and trying out new combinations of skills and coin distribution
but i have never had a character die and have only fought  bosses that posed any threat even the final boss seemed too easy at level  didny even heal once
there is only one secret in the game and no sidequests
but like i said it was simply fun  thats about it
no ff here but defenitly worth a rent or two can be beaten in less than  hoursgrandia  is a fun game
i really did enjoy playing it
there are a few flaws that keep it from a perfect score however it is still an excellent and enjoyable experience overall
lets begin the reviewgraphics  the graphics are somewhat similar to ff in that your characters are composed of simpler shapes and only have eyes on their faces no mouths folks
however the graphical world of grandia  looks a lot smoother than ffs and is less pixelated
some people may not enjoy the simple graphical design after having seen more realistic looking games but it didnt perturb me one bit the graphics are bright and colorful
if you need further information about what this game actually looks like just take a gander at some screen shots
note there are some graphical glitches from time to time but they do not affect gameplay in any real waymusic  hmmm is is just me or is the same song used for every dungeon
why yes
well aside from the lack of variety the music isnt too bad
its nothing to run out and buy the soundtrack for but its not so annoying as to make your ears bleed
also the game features voice acting during some but not all dialogue
the voice acting is decent and there was no one whose voice i really hatedcharacters  yes i know these characters are basically stereotypes youve got the innocent naive female character the toughacting mercenary the strong noble beastman etc
even though i realized i had seen all this before they didnt feel like stereotypes to me
the fresh interesting dialogue really made me fall in love with these characters
there was never a point in which i said gee these people bore me
personally i think ryudo steals the show
i know some people wont like his pessimism and sarcastic wit but personally i found his comments to be really funnystory  you start the game as a coldhearted mercenary who takes a job escorting a young naive girl to a tower to perform a religious ceremony
along the way ancient evil is released and you discover the truth behind the ruling religion etc
sound familiar
just like the characters the story too has been done before
however i still felt that the story was very interesting and entertaining even if you may have an idea of whats going to happen next
grandia  does a good job of retelling this archetypal rpg story such that it feels fresh and interesting
plus for an alreadydone plotline at least its more interesting than mostbattle system  grandia  battle system is more complex than your average turnbased affair
you actually have to factor in things such as range of spellsattacks and timing of attacks
there is a small bar at the bottom of the screen that tells when you or the enemy will take their turn if you do certain attacks and hit the enemy while they are in the red section of the bar it will cancel their attack forcing them to wait longer to get off a move
this works in reverse too of course
this system really adds more depth to the gameplay
another plus to the battle system is that your characters will move around on the screen during battle eliminating the lets all line up and attack feel of other turnbased games by the way im not bothered by attacking in lines but others may enjoy getting away from that
also because you move around and spells and attacks have ranges factoring in how close you are to the enemy and how bunched together the enemies are which means you can hit them all with one spell is important
overall i found the battle system to be fun and interestinggameplay  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
lets see i really enjoyed the meal conversations
this is where the characters are further developed by allowing you to choose people to talk to while having dinner
i feel this aspect really does enhance character development
on another note the linearity of the game really hampers it
you cant ever backtrack to previous places past the last two places you visited
even if there is no logical reason you couldnt return to the first town you were in not like it was destroyed or anything the game never allows you to
in fact you dont have free travel even by the time you get to the end of the game
that and the fact that the world map is a point and click to the next place sort of deal might turn people off
theres also a disturbing lack of sidequests and minigames available
i recall there only being one side dungeon and one minigame
hmmm  the menus and controls are fine and other than the points ive already mentioned theres really nothing else thats noteworthyoverall  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
personally i derived great enjoyment out of this game despite its flaws
it would have a perfect score if it werent for the lack of sidequests and the linearity
whether you not these limitations will prevent your enjoyment of the game is a matter of your own personal preferences but i found the overall grandia  experience to be worthwhilei remember the first grandia
it had soo much fun and adventure
the characters could crawl inside the air ducks fly in the sky to get to the evil skyship runing on a railroad escaping from the big explotion of the skyship hiding in a boat breaking a fast runing train so the bad guys couldnt get them sailing alone in the sea escaping from prision climbing a gigantic wall and spying from the roofsbut the game had bad graphics stupid characters terrible voice acting so so powers and a very childist stylethis game improved the graphics to d the powers were sooo coool and very well animated like final fantasy  the characters are even cooler like chrono trigger but not like akira toriyama style and the voices were soo much betterbut this game doesnt have to much fun and adventure like the first grandiajust imagine the rpg chrono trigger with good d graphics predictable story and without cool fun adventure
this game concentrate only on the action
but is one of the best actionpacked rpgs i ever played
adiosmore than just a few good sonic games came from the dreamcast
grandia ii a compelling rpg by game arts is not only for the dreamcast anymore but also playstation  and pc
the playstation  version also includes all new never seen before cinematics
if thats not enough its certainly okay because grandia ii has much more to offerfirst of all the battle system i find many rpgs to be quite similar to one another
their battle system is overall the same
this is not the case for grandia ii
it is a mixture of active time and turn base battle
there is one time bar that enemies and allies share
everyone has his or her own icon on that bar
when they reach a certain point on the bar a menu appears for that character
this is when the turn base battle takes place
you can take as long as you like to carefully choose your attack
pick the correct attack and you could even destroy the enemy or send them back to the beginning of the time baroverall the battle system makes this game unique and addicting
not only that but the much dreaded random battles is eliminated
you see the enemies before you go into battle with them
and if you wish many times you can simply run from themnext the graphics and sound in grandia ii there is voice acting during many of the cutscenes
voices are also heard during battle
i find them to be well done unlike some of the cheesy dialog in games
its not the best voice acting around but certainly didnt make me cringe as much as in the first grandia
the graphics are also done well in the d world
everything is colorful and carefully donethe only complaint i have in this category is some of the battle animations were long and drawn out for what they were
even the skill of poison had a long animationfinally the story i think that every rpg needs to have a decent story
grandia ii definitely has a deep story
it starts out with ryudo the geohound and his bird companion skye
they meet up with the talented vocalist named elena part of the sisters of granas who needs to be escorted to another location
from then on the story unfolds
the story touches a lot on being yourself the lighter side of evil a church betrayal love triangles and alter egos
even if it is a little predicting it is still satisfyingprosinnovative and addicting battle systemwonderful d graphicsgreat level up system for skillsgreat story and charactersconsseemed pretty short took me  hours to completelong battle animationsthe gameplay is superb
controls are easy to use but provide enough challenge for a longtime gamercombat is so fluid and nice to look at that i sometimes found myself staring at the screen wondering why no was moving before realizing that i wasnt just watching i was participating
boss fights in particular however require a great deal of concentration and careful strategy all of which pays off in the endthe magic and skills and moves offer a seemingly neverending level of possibilities although the game seems to be long on points for your moves short on points for your magicitems both equipable and throwaway are more varied than in the first game and for that matter are more varied than in just about any other title
no matter what your character equips they remain basically the same though the weapons change a bit if you look carefully but this is a minor quibblethe only major flaws with this game rests in the story
now im not complaining that they talk too much they just talk too slowly and repeat themselves a lot
i love a good story as much as the next guy but trust me we get the idea the first time
ryudos cynical elenas a nice person and theyre off to kill valmar
right then on to the next plot point
but no you have to watch the words dribble across the screen while the characters keep on talkinggrandia originally for the sega saturn is the essence of an outandout underground landmark
riding along the celestial gamut with the likes of chrono trigger and super mario rpg the first grandia bought forth a skillfully representation of the hero struggle and an extraordinary battle engine
however gamearts second attempt to reinstate their own grandia principles doesnt rank up as climatic as the original
their dagger to live up to the name of grandia ii is simultaneously sharp and dull
gamearts manages to rejuvenate the reincarnation of an unparalleled battle system and a fiercely polished graphical trimming then leaving their previous strong points on plot and characters in the gutters of rpg degradationlets not dwell on the fact that grandia ii has a few shortcomings in its story presentation
first lets invest time on a breakdown on why grandia ii is noteworthy and slightly distant from a humdrum rpg
what serves as its vantage side is the impressive and addictive hybrid of realtime and turnbased clash
ballooned on the screen are the selected combatants in a fullsized hoedown with enormous fiends
grandia iis system is based on a bar found at the bottom of the screen
the bar contains faces of each individual participating in the battle enemies included
adjoining on it are the three segments of wait com and act
after the wait portion a specified face hits the com and an action for a character is selected
the face then advances to the act sector where the command is initiated
technical actions such as skill moves or screenbursting spells entail a longer delay to reach the act segment
each hero has his or her identifiable imperfection and assets
ryudo is best for fighting elena is ideal for healing the battered party millenia keeps an implicit armory of black magic roan attacks in impeccable speed and the ferocious mareg is frequently sent to deliver heavy duty damage
grandia ii warrants a blessing for employing such strategic ordergladly monsters are visible throughout the game
the player may choose to charge headon or avoid and hurriedly confront the huge boss
at times though its mandatory to have a smack down with enemies when pulling some type of switch but it sure beats the vexing randomness of countless rpgs
moreover learning and acquiring skills are caught in a breeze
stockpiling mp and sp points from victories the player determines the desired skills from mana eggs and skill books
in general the fighting is easy to manipulate and is an unqualified joy to take a womppin onon its graphical viewpoint the colors are crisp and superclean
the involvedness in dungeons are good and works well with the line of heroes plowing through it
in the battle shot spells are among the most aweinspiring and not as timeconsuming as squares ridiculous incantations
a mix of polygons extreme lighting effects and animation is truly something still fresh and worth the mention
implemented on a quickie nonsticky battle pace grandia ii is pomp of what the dreamcast could handle but further indicates the force of the psand onto the dark side of grandia ii
to those who plan to seed hours on any rpg its estimated to read or watch a story of great magnitude unfold but gamearts fails miserably
nowhere near the past scenario grandia ii is an entirely new tale featuring a mercenary and his conquest to escort a songstress to slay an evil called valmar with all the sidequests in between
slowly progressed the story is a strain to watch and to scoop into
the central hero ryudo seems like a mixed bag of cloud from ffvii and squall from ffviii
personally i would love to see cloud rip ryudo from flesh and limb with his limit break the omnislash
for squall  well who really did like him
the unceasing baddie melfice though is not even worth a mention with his weak voiceover and boring intentions
and dont get me started on roan and his little secret
its been duplicated so many times that the astonishment was not intended for the character but for gamearts who actually had the balls to comprise the hackneyed bombshell
and whats more irksome than predictable twists and the shortage of suspense is the dialogue that tries to be funny clever and philosophical
the poor construction of reworked characters and plot robbed grandia ii of its ancillary staralthough feathery on the challenge the weighty amount of dungeons will chain players down with the bulk of  time gorged on quests and dialogue
about  hours will shed off your ticking machines
with all the hype and hope i had going for it it pains me not to appraise grandia ii with  stars but with all the chinks in its plot justice has been served
grandia ii is a marvel to play but a nuisance to read
when all is said and done the only thing that can really sweeten the grandia pot is the wait for grandia xtreme which is due later this month in japan
hopefully gamearts will take their tight spots into account and nurture a grandia that revolves on the third times a charm traditionwhen i played this i could tell it was a port but nevertheless still a decent rpg
worth a try for rpg gamersgreat performance but you will pay for it
these though were on a decent sale and thus little more expensive than other halfway decent component cables
with component video being an analog signal unlike hdmi it can definitely be worth it to chip in at least a few extra dollars for nicer cablesid just never pay anywhere near retail for thesethe only downsides are that the audio is attached to the video which means you can run it to another destination like an amplifier and that for some reason that reason being profits it utilizes a proprietary port for the digital audio outnot the standard optical out that every other device on the planet uses
so if you want to take advantage of the optical output you need to buy the actual overpricedagain digital not analog monster lightwave cable hence profitsbut this cable is long sturdy and generally quite nice
if youre not planning on running it to a separate receiver and arent planning on using the optical output or have more money than sense and if theyre on a decent sale i payed i believe  then i say grab themplugging the red and white audio jacks intoyour receiver is not going to give you soundtheyre analog outsyou need the optical adapter to accommodate the toslink optical cable to receive dolby digitalthe onlyother way is through the coaxial digital inputon your recieverbut its not as clean a connection as fiber optici think if you are someone who is still looking for a way to play the original xbox on an hdtv with good results you should get these cablesto be honest it was a bit of a pain to plug the jacks in at first but once they are connected the video quality is really greati would suggest these cables to anyone who still owns a classic xbox because not all classic xbox games will play on the xbox so it helps to keep the big black box around for those games that cannot be played any other wayi have tried these cables out on two seperate hdtvs and both times the picture quality was greatthese are better than composite cables and even better than svideo tooso if you wanna play those classic xbox games at a higer resolution and they will not play on the xbox  you cant go wrong with thesealso for the price its pretty much a bargainas mentioned the cables are very tight i thought something may have been wrong with them until i read these reviews
they are made like no other cables i have ever seen very thick and heavy army grade
the picture is great but the resolution is only as good as the media transmitting it so you are not going to do better then p on most gamesinfact i have yet to find an original xbox game that plays highermust be just the recent ones
my favorite game black a fps looked best with these but again its still only pas far as the price i bought mine on ebay
they cost  with shpping and that included the monster optical cable both still sealed
that was a private party but i would suggest checking there first if you are comfortable with them
keep in mind the audio wont be any better if you dont get the optical cable dont get monster you can get one on here for under if you want the absolute best price for your original xbox this is the rolls royce
i read someone say why are they more expensive then the microsoft versionbecause those are crap in comparison
monster doesnt make a difference on all cables but this is a case where they dohappy gamingive played and owned every america released ff so i know quite a bit about the series
this game was pretty cool and the storyline was great
i liked the fact that they were able to use the ps graphics to show the characters expressions really well
they almost seem like real people
everything about this game i liked except for the weapons and armor too much
it was like overkill
if they cooled it with all the different attachments you could put on the weapons and armor id rate this game a definite 
now the attachments on ffviii were pretty cool because you could attach as much as you wanted even to the point where you could almost be invincible
but all in all if you havent ever played this game you definitely shouldwell any final fantasy fan will want ot add this to their list
one thing that stands out above all else is the graphics on this game
they are awesome
long time fans of final fantasy series will be disapointed because of the poor job that was done on voice overs but if you look past that you will be fine
the game is a little shorter compared to the others but im thinking the downside to the game is due to squares concetration on making ffxi the big online game that should be coming later in  a newbie to this game might like it but long time fans might find a lot more downs than ups
over all it is a great game that any fan of square games and the ff series should ownive played ffxiiffx without knowing there was a prequel and ffx is the only one i liked and completed
ffx is one of the best games for the ps
i would recommend this to people who like amazing stories and rpgs
i liked the features in the game but i disliked the camera and how you would get an ending screen and you couldnt save afterwardsoverall after the disappointments of ff and ff ffx is a nice breath of fresh air into the franchise
its levelling system specifically the sphere grid is a bit obtuse at times but it allows you a rather nice control over how each character developes over time
the minigames are addictive once you get the hang of them though blitzball isnt for everyone
as always the plot and visuals are wonderful and i like how they changed the battle system
it really lends itself to strategy nowhmm  cons would be that there is no japanese voice track and the first fourty hours of gameplay roughly are basically one huge tutorial
if you can slog through that and youre a diehard rpg fan i think youll find this game is definitely worth your moneyin the latest addition to squaresofts final fantasy series square proves to us that it actually listens to reader feedback
numerous changes to the gaming style have been incorporated into this sequel which ill talk about as followsgraphics the pss power truly shines here
abandoning prerendered backgrounds for the majority of the game final fantasy finally becomes a fully d active environment
lighting watersky effects and the like all prove that the ps is capable of handling graphical miracles
in what has to be the best choice in the history of the game almost all of the games cutscenes are delivered with the ingame graphics engine instead of repeatedly cutting to fmv
the pss huge polygon support allowed square to create character models fully capable of displaying extraordinary realism
every character moves freely at natural joints in natural ways and follow no rigid animations unlike previous games where all the quotshockedquot appearances were the same etc
the fmv while stunning is used sparingly something i think is greatly beneficial to the flow of the game especially since the fmv in all the final fantasy games just seems to lack compared to the movieobviouslymusicsound uematsus finest suite of compositions thusfar debuts in x  catchy upbeat and unrepetetive music makes you want to turn up the stereo system
in addition to great remixes of old familiar tunes the new rendition of the chocobo theme is jazzy and sounds great uematsu included great new music including a new battle them
definitely a compilation that collectors will want to own on cd
this is also the first final fantasy to feature voice acting for every major character in the game
while a nice touch i wish square had included the ability to turn the voices off tidus the title character is a bit too annoying after a while for meand i like imagining what the characters sound like for myself
storylinecharacter development in my opinion the best story sequence square has ever produced
although linear like all final fantasies are and have to be in order to deliver a story effectively the game focuses much more on character development instead of around the central quotbeatthebigbadguyquot goal
i really get a feel for every character introduced
and unlike many of the previous games there are few sudden quotheresanewultimatebadguythatyouneversawcomingquot types
hooraygameplay this is where square proves it listens to customer feedback
previous complaints about the series include overly numerous random encounters complicated development systems and stupid puzzles
the random encounters have been greatly reduced and are easy to escape from should you not want to participate
the new quotleveling systemquot while complex looking at first is much simpler than previous games
character ability increase occurs through the accumulation and distribution of ap and equipment and believe me much simpler than the junction system or similar
much much simpler
the puzzles in the form of temple trials are challenging but able to be solved by logic the way puzzles should be
square also ditched the active time battle system allowing you to fight at your own pace and plan strategies with much more accuracy
fighting strategies have also changed since most characters are able to kill most enemies with one hit because they can exploit a specific weaknessoh and blitzball is the most addictive quotminigamequot its not exactly mini ever
and unlike the card game in ffix you actually get a reward for being the bestthe only beef i have with the game is that there isnt nearly as much room for exploration through most of the game
in previous fantasies dungeons were larger and offered you more freedom to explore and find rare items
in this series however dungeons are almost always linear with one obvious path you can follow and only a few items on the sideoverall worth buying
ff junkies and newer gamers alike will embrace this game as a great investmentwell let me say that i have been a hardcore gamer for the past  years of my life
i have played every single one of final fantasies some in japanese in fact
that said i was extremely excited to buy this game and couldnt wait to get right into it
i took it home and opened it after happily paying  for it
the first thing any loyal true gamer notices when opening the box is that there is  and only  disc
i first thought to myself quotdid i miss something
was i supposed to buy another one too
but alas the game is only  disc longthis however did not discourage me
my love for the ff series still overwhelmed me as i anxiously played the gamenow when i say i am a hardcore gamer that means i have played hundreds of rpgs in my day and it takes a lot to amaze me as far as plot
ff after all these years is still probably one of my top  or  favorite rpgs despite its dated graphics because the plot really kept you glued to the controllers and there was so much to do in the game you could easily spend  hours playing it and still not get boredwell after about  hours of frustration tediousness and sometimes just plain anger i finished ffx
this is by far the worst game in the ff series for a number of reasons i shall now list
plot where is it
what the devil was square thinking
this game makes about as much sense as screen doors on a space ship
sins toxin
tidus iswhat
come on i know they could have done better then that
much much better
english voice overs down right laughable
i know square has the money to employ real quality voice actors but alas they seemed to have foolishly chosen not to
tiduss voice is so annoying i usually would just mute the tv and stick to reading the subtitles
fighting system you never stop fighting
the stupid system they have employed for leveling up and advancement is a giant part of what makes this game so horrible
yes the graphics are stunning at first and color and animation that is used in summoning aeons is breathtaking but trust me this will get old since you will be too busy trying to look for a plot that simply isnt there
like i said i finished the game in about  hours
i would say a good  percent of that was all fighting the same creatures over and over again
at a pretty early stage in the game summoning becomes obsolete because you can just wack the crap out of most things about  times with tidus wakka and auron
stupid mini games i am convinced that square set out to totally and completely shame and debase chocobos in this game
in the past final fantasys chocobos were a cute and often helpful addition to the games side and main quests
in this game the little mini game side quest involving racing them is so stupid i dont know how it even made it past the storyboarding phase of its development
and you can completely forget about completing those stupid temple puzzles without the help of gamefaqscom or the prima strategy guidein summary this game is tedious to say the least
horrible pretty much nonexistent plot
you will be half way through the game and hope that the ending will tie everything together only to finish the game and be thoroughly disappointed
while this game is much more reasonable at  dollars then it was at  seriously consider getting it used if at all
anyone who rates this game above  stars is being way too nice
they also probably are not hardcore gamers but rather are people who are easily amused by pretty graphics and shiny things sigh
also dont bother with ffx because it robes this game of what little dignity it hasi too really did try to love this game as the final fantasy series has delivered some of those most breathtaking and epic stories i have seen in my life
but this game is shameful and does not deserve the final fantasy title at allwell this game certainly has its shares of ups and downs
when i first started playing i was simply in love with it
the first day i played for  hours in one sitting the next day  hours and another  the day after
i had a wonderful time but the more i played the more i realized things were somewhat falling apart
i wanted to give this a  but anything less than a  just seems unfair
i almost love to hate itwhere ff succeeds with a huge multilayered story ffx keeps a quite simple plot
and where ff has enough well written dialog to fill a novel ffx throws it all out the window in place of a few lines of voice acting
however ffx does a great job with the battle system and almost every single character is extremely useful
the level system is unique but good
the battles are fun quick and a huge improvement over ff and ff
ffx truly brings some great things to the table while keeping the best of the old school final fantasysadly though the story cant really hold up to the gameplay
it has its bright spots but overall its rather flawed
tidus and yuna may just be the most pathetic lead characters in ff history except maybe ff
in battle theyre both incredible and so is nearly every other character
the rest of the time however is a very different story
tidus is an overgrown toddler who hates his daddy for no good reason
his voice acting is atrocious with non stop whining
yuna seems almost like a poorly done aeris with the energy of hyatt from excel saga
both in voice acting and story yuna is simply so withdrawn its not even funny
she sounds and acts like shes on life support or some kind of pain killerthe rest of the characters dont fare much better but at least they have fairly good to great voices
kimari seems like a bad snl skit
then we have wakka at times a complete retard and redneck
rikku is the picture of nubile cuteness and my personal favorite but shes often given airheaded lines
lulu fares the best of the girls with a mysterious story and lovely dark attitude
leaving auron with the best story and a level of cool thats unmatchedall together you get a game with a mild story at best but a top notch battle system and quite enjoyable gameplay
so long as you can stomach the most bland of voice acting from the most unlikable of couple youll have a good time playing
the game is fun fast paced and graphically stunning under the junk
its by far the best final fantasy since ff making it the second best to date in my book and bumping ff to a distant third rirathcom great improvementgraphics and talking style gameplay doesnt compare much w ff and neither does the story
 shouldnt tidus be a fist fighter like sionthe bouncer instead of a swordsman because he does not look much like one and he does not fight as good either
cloudffcould take him on any day
 what kind of cheesy sport is blitzballim not a very big fan of the ff series i have played numbers  and  and for the most part enjoyed them
but i didnt find them groundbreaking lake most people claim them to be
im not really an rpg fan also but i love the chrono series
so i didnt really excpect much from this game
but when i started to play i found the game to be incredble as the game went on it turned out to be a game like every other final fantasy with a very generic plot
but still the game is very well done its the first in the series to feature voice oversand the graphics are very good but the only thing different frolm the others is the new battle system which i find very well done it lets you swch characters during battle and includes an overkill
if you love the ff series im sure youll love this but if your not a big fan of them you might want to rent this firstthis game is well done
fun to play
graphically beautiful
good story and character development
this is a good progression for the seriesi say this being of sound mind and in possession of every single final fantasy game for playstation and playstation  yes i know that is disturbing final fantasy x is one of the best final fantasies
its about time that square added voices to the final fantasy games being that other companies were doing it in their playstation  rpgs
my only problem is at times the voices arent well done
they sound like middle school or high school actors just learning the craft trust me i know
that and titus has a tendency to whine like a little spoiled brat
the best of the voices comes from rikku as she actually sounds like she isnt just reading lines
the graphics are very nice reminiscent of ff only better
the music as is always the case sounds like some of it was extracted from the other ff games
im not talking about the ff theme and the prelude
im talking aeriss theme and the theme to guru volcano the first final fantasy
but with so many games and so much music a lot of it starts sounding like each other
the story is somewhat more original and it seems to deviate from the giant meteor or evil empire or the evil magic user
all of the first  ffs should fit into those catagories by the way
you get to fight sin in this one
thats right sin
all i can tell is that it is this giant spherelike thing like the movie sphere that just sucks everything up like a giant vacuum
though the real creature is inside the sphere but i wont give that away
the story is also filled with massive amounts of religious and polictical connotations
this reminds me of ff tactics or xenogears
it is not a bad thing
if games have religion in them perhaps it can help strengthen faiths of the players
if children can become violent because of video games maybe they can become more spiriualreligious as well
one can hope right
the only problem is that the story is very adult
and thus being adult it may not be suitable for younger players
my recommended minimum age is   under no circumstances should anyone younger play this game
players have complained that the final fantasy games are too kiddie well now they are getting there wishand apparently they are now complaining it is too adult
if i had one to chose it would be adult
the story is always better as it can have more substance
this is another great thing about the game
it is filled with story and again people complain
no story too much story stop complaining and play the game
i have always figured that people who find a final fantasy with too much story are expecting an action or adventure game
i hate to tell you this but rpg are supposed to have stories
sorry to break it to you
anyway i like ffx
not that my opinion matters to some but still i like it
it hopefully shows that squares games for the ps will turn around and become better
but wait i havent talked about the battle system yet silly me
gone is atb and the peasants rejoiced
the battles are about as real time as they are going to get
instead of a charge gauge everyone has a turn in the battle lineup
you would think that you have to wait until everything happens but this is not the case
creatures dont attack simultaniously but you can get the battle moving quickly almost lifelike by just having everyone attack as fast as they can
thats much better than waiting for a stupid little gauge to fill up
another nice touch is that you can sub people in during the battle
since exp has been done away with if a character acts in a battle they get ap
ap acts like exp but it works differetly
you get a certain number of ap and your skill level goes up allowing you to learn new skills on the skill gird provided you have skill orbs
that is how you power up your charactersthrough this skill grid
this grid must have more than  additions on it so quotleveling upquot may take longer than expected
but its worth it to be able to have more than  hps  mps and way over  points of damage
i do say that i hate the ending
less than  minutes for a  hour game the ending is too short
oh and by the way yes you can shorten the summon times its called using the config menu
thats all i will say
dont give in to sin buy the game
please excuse the stupid jokethis game wasnt a horrific disgusting waste of money but compared with others in the series i am a little put off by how many people think it is unquestionably the bestas someone who plays rpgs primarily for their fantastic betterthanhollywood stories i was left feeling devoid and empty after conquering ff handsdown the most looseendresolving game i have ever played in any series period
not wanting to replay any others at the time i decided against someone closes advice to pop in ff and give it a shot
and after i passed the point where certain characters boarded a ship and left the first village i was glad i didfor one thing the voice acting alone was particularly excitingi had always dreamed of the day when someone would convert treasures like ff and ff into fullblown movies and this was the closest thing so far
i was a little concerned about the cheesiness in certain places mostly the beginning or involving rikku who i did find very useful in battle and the fact that yuna sounded completely bored about everything you talked to her about but for the most part the verbage and dialect of each character was consistent and the cheesiness was allocated to the more lighthearted characters who either became endearing too powerful in battle to dislike or both
even tiduss jocky character which still gave impressions of cool shallowness rigbt through to the end was anchored substantially by his intermittent pensive almost nostalgic narrations
complete with many musical tracks that blurred emotional lines at exactly the appropriate moments and overlooking the fact that some of the music was mastered too loudly for the dialogue i would give this game  stars if it were based only on the graphics and cinematic quality which are just short of fantasticthe fighting system as well is actually one of the most entertaining ive ever experienced in a ff
ill admit itim the person who just attacks everything with physical weapons as fast as possible just to get through the random battles as fast as possible i almost never escape because i end up leveling up a little ahead of where i should be when i just stick it out but this game has probably broken me of that lazy antistrategist habit forever
the ability to switch out and use every character in battle not only for me anyway kept the lead characters adequately leveled up theyre never my favorites for some reason but also was a great exercise in strategy even though some characters ended up with odd attributes in the sphere grid later on in the game lulu was the last to learn ultima and kimahri became a skilled white wizard
even though the sphere grid was a little frustrating at times spending hours trying to get lv
 spheres for instance it was exciting to see characters attributes going up when they were already kicking 
customizing your own weapons too was probably one of the most satisfying features ever to be included in a linear rpg and it was great for example to just buy up a bunch of shimmering blades and then make auron one of everything i could just see him perusing his supplies and casually selecting how he wanted to kill somethingpoison
stone
zombification
the possibilities are numerous if not endless though the process of obtaining the ingredients took about as many hours as all the other parts of the game put together i finally just gave up on getting  hypello potions for everyone and farplane winds forget it
so the fighting system in sum also gets a the reason i absolutely had to give this game a  and actually the reason why i had to say something after reading several negative comments by halfwaythroughers is the ending
maybe its because i had just come out of playing ff where everyone and his dog has a complete satisfying happy or notsohappy ever after but even compared with young merlin where you have little characters jumping up and down and mumbling at each other and which is not even an rpg this ending sucks
not because of the main thing that happens which everyone who has played through to the very end knows what im talking about and which probably inspired a lot of the ff amvs on youtube but because they to put it appropriately completely dropped the blitzball on everything else
not that the main thing was done very well eitherthe male character involved was much too complacent with the truth when he found it out and unfortunately this carried over to everything elsebut im sure im not alone in my absolute hatred of game endings where youve become completely attached to the characters and then after the big buildup and the final boss they say a maximum of two words and then the credits come
what the living  is the point of creating interest in the characters and this can be applied to any mediumbooks movies etcit even happened with a certain series about a british boy wizard and then not taking two extra seconds to make up a satisfying completefeeling ending for them
more pointedly what is the point of creating nonlead characters at all when theyre just going to be ignored later and given no future
barrett in ff setzer in ff rydia in ffi even liked steiner as one of the best in ffwhat if they had all been blown by the wayside at the end of those games
i would have thrown something along with millions of other people im sure
fortunately my favorite guy in ff had a decent resolution but even that was blown off by the other characters themselves and there were four charactersfour out of seven who i dont think even got to speak after the final battle
the final battle itself wasnt too pretty eitherthat handy limitbreak on the masamune led me to kill the final boss with one  hit after seymour aka sephiroth killed me at least  times on mt
gagazet resulting in  of the  game overs i got during the whole game
sorry but when i got beat the  out of in the omega dungeon and barely escaped with my life i expected the final battle to be a little more challenging
i must say though that the one salvation of the end something that happened before the final battle was absolutely beautiful and i actually teared up at that point where i didnt even have time to be sad about anything else later on because it was over so quickly
the whole fatherson relationship and the part of the story concerning everyone involved with the jecht spheres was the true heart of this story in my book and its playingout was a triumphall in all my best advice would be to stick with this game
even if it seems a bit cheesy from the offset it gets better and even if the ending doesnt satisfy you either the story itself before that is worth playing though and you can always make up your own ending in your head if it bothers you enoughwhile i greatly enjoyed this installment in the final fantasy saga it was just a tad bit different than the past games with its few flawsfirst off the good stuff
the graphics rock the music is good the characters are all very unique and memorable especially auron one of the coolest of all timeplus the gameplay is one of the funnest in the final fantasy seriesthe fact that you can actually control the summoned monsters was awesome beyond belief
seeing anima attack for k damage on a regular attack is something to seehowever in my opinion there are a few things which knocked a star off this games ratingfirst off theres wakka and kimahri
kimahri spoke very little almost to a point of being a mute
add in the fact that his character is a jack of all trades and master of none and you will find yourself using him very rarely
he is pretty much filler gameplay wise and story wisethen theres wakka oh boy where to starthis voice acting sounds ridiculous as a jamaican surfer or something
not to mention that he is possibly the strongest character in the game and his weapon is a volleyballi found myself keeping him in the back ranks against everything except flying enemies which he specializes againstnow quite possibly the worst part of the game the sidequeststhe sidequests dont even start until youre about  through the game and finally acquire the airship
than the torture beginsjust thinking about the final chocobo race the butterfly catching and dodging  lightning bolts makes me cringe
and catching  of every monster in the game for the battle arena
ouchthough it kind of evens out because the items you get through these terribly difficult and frustrating mini games are very powerfulall in all this game is a truly awesome experience
it took me about  hours to beat the game with about  of the sidequests finished
and every minute was a joy except for some of those sidequestsbut to put it simply if own a ps and enjoy role playing games than you cannot be without this game
its easily one of the classics for both the playstation and the final fantasy seriesill start with a summary of the gameprosoverall high quality of a square gamegood plot and excellent plot developmentmemorable charactersoriginal battle systemoriginal character leveling systemauron is coolvery decent graphicsblitzball is pretty fun once you get used to itconsmusic is repetitive and while it has good audio quality it gets boring fastvoice acting is cool to hear but gets out of tune and very odd in some instances
also some of the characters have outofcharacter voices ie
tiduss voice can go way too high and yuna souns kind of breathy all the time
boring hard repetitive frustrating minigamesnow ill explain
the game really is highquality and features a lot of new and interesting elements
theres no more world map at least not that you can actually run around on
the atb system is gone replaced by a purely turnbased battle system and in addition you can switch characters in and out of battles at any time
this is offset by the fact that each characters has only one set of abilities as defined by the new method of character development the sphere grid
the sphere grid is basically a long string of abilities and stat boosts that your character moves along
you need items called spheres imagine that to activate these upgrades or nodes
this is a lot easier and handier than it sounds
also as you get better items and a lot more levels you become able to teach some characters abilities to others
for example tidus knows the haste spell but auron can move into his grid when hes done with his own and learn haste for himselfthe plot is while unusually dark still very welldeveloped and interesting
you can connect with and understand most of the charaters and auron is awesome
hes a quiet sarcastic unshakable guy with a trench coat and sunglasses and a massive sword
whats not to like
tidus himself is ok although every once in a while youll want to smack him for being dumbwhere this game falls down is in the audio
music is unoriginal not very catchy and is repeated constantly
compare to ffviiis score
voice acting while an improvement over voice bubbles needs a lot of work as with many games translated from the japanese
its most obvious when the voiceactor has to say something veryveryfastandmushthewordstogether to fit it into the time when the lips are moving
this sounds pretty ridiculous when theyre making some deep thoughtful solemn statementthe minigames can all be avoided which is a blessing because they are mindnumbingly hard and not even fun
blitzball which is not really a minigame is a lot betterso thats all
i give it a  stars because its not perfect
if the voice acting and the score were a little better i might give it   dont let that stop you from buying it though especially now that its in the ps classics and only costs  bucksi enjoy roleplaying games and have for well over a decade
that being said im not the kind of person who likes to have to learn entire new sports games or languages to figure out a gameffx does not require that you learn all of its minutia to complete the game but its amazing graphics and captivating storyline make you want to learn more and more about tidus yuna wakka and the other main characters
with the upcoming ffx learning about yuna in her first game will become all the more importantas much as i enjoy the lush graphics and amazing storyline it seems that ffx is continuing a trend that began with ffvii and continued
the trend to which i refer is the gradual decline in fighting and increase in short dialog sequences that are not possible to skip
in ffx the first  hours seem more like the ff movie than a video game
this is great in terms of graphics but bad for those of us who like to tear into the battle schemes and destroy some baddiesall in all another great game that raises the graphical and plot bar for all other rpgsi got this game back in 
i never finished it because for some reason the final boss was impossible to beat and i was way ahead in levels
i did love the storyline and the characters were great
really had they waited to finish the actual game instead of putting it out early it would have been perfect
the graphics are not so great but the cg cutscenes and the ability to replay them later on is just awesomenessdid i mention seymour guado
gah
will final fantasy ever stop making me fall in love
and will square enix ever decide to focus a game on the bad guyimagine my surprise when i got a phone call this morning december th telling me that my copy of ffx had come in
i was under the impression that the game wasnt set to be released until january but i guess christmas came five days early this year
ive only put in a meager three hours into the game so far but these are my thoughts so fargraphics as usual ffxs graphics are astounding
the blitzball game during the opening literally gave me goosebumps
remember the pod race in star wars i
its like that only cool
the cinema scenes are as lush as ever but are by no means heads and shoulders above those seen on the ps installments
no the real show is in the real time scenes
the characters have fully animated faces and take another step towards quotis it a real person or notquot territory
in fact the only thing i dislike about the graphics portion of ffx is that only tidus is displayed while exploring in ff all characters were displayedsound voices
i was actually a little worried when i first read that ffx would feature voice actors resident evil anyone but i am thus far pleasantly surprised
while tidus voice is a bit high its by no means annoying
the music with the exception of the blitzball sound track is a bit disappointing though
why the hell square hasnt decided to add a little variety to the battle music is beyond mebattle system the new use of aeons summoned monsters is a vast improvment over their former quotcameoquot appearances
even cooler though is the fact that characters can be switched out during battles
this option adds a whole new level of strategy to ff battles
the sphere grid is a bit confusing at first but also appears to be a positive improvement over the former methods of developing your characters
in fact the only problem with ffxs battle system is the fact that the battles are still random that makes this a four not five star game in my book
random battles are really really annoying as they have been for the past decade of ff games
take a look at chrono trigger or chrono cross for a better though far from perfect way to handle battles in an rpgfrom the little ive experienced so far the story appears to be a vast improvement over the convolution of ff and my first impressions of this game definately make it among the best of ps games so far definately on par with if not better than metal gear solid 
so far so goodi thought that final fantasy x was a pretty fun game
the gameplay was good and the story was descent
the voice acting was kind of cheesy sounding but its nice
overall the game is fun and worth itthis was a good game
although the beginning has a lot of fmv and little action give the game some time and it picks up
ive played every ff and finished all but  heres my breakdown on this oneprosbest battle system ever allows character switching in battlesphere grid system for leveling up both innovative and simple to learn definately among my favorite level systemsbeautiful graphicsstunning soundtrack as alwaysplenty of sidequestsfirst ff where characters actually talknot my favorite ending but not a bad one
just too ambiguousmixedsummoning system very differet has its plusses and minusesnot my favorite group of characters as a whole but some characters are coolconssome sidequests are rather dull hitting the x button  times for examplesome of the voice acting was a little weakprobably not the best first ff for newcomers because its so different
ffix or ffvi are probably a better starting placeall in all a good game definately worth a playthis was an amazing game
most of the fun of any other ff title with the graphics of the ps
some plusses are the new level up system which would seem very confusing if i explained it here but is actually quite simple
play the game and find out for yourself the fact that the characters talk amazing graphics and an improvement on the gfs from ffviii called aeons
some minusestheres no world map so exploring doesnt have the same thrill some characters have abilities that are completely impractical such as one characters ability to learn enemy attacksthat do almost no damage and the lamea minigameblitzball which is in essence turn based football
and you have to play this stupid waste to get some rare items
oh well
its definitely not like the ffviii card game or the golden saucer in ffvii
this is a must have game though
buy it nowin the most classic and richest sense final fantasy x encapsulates the struggle between a domineering father and a strengthening son only kafka put to paper a better interpretation of this theme yet ffx is the inverse of the metamorphosis instead of a son finding himself having become a beetle upon waking subsequently locked away in his room fed by his sister mourned by his mother and despised even feared by his father the creators of ffx have transformed the father into a monstrous entity simply referred to as sin who punishes the towns and people of the futuristic world of spira hoping that one day his son who he sin has transported  years into the future will defeat him and throw an apple into the back of his miseryyou assume the role of tidus a professional blitzball player from the past who is seeking to find his way home if he can to zanarkand a city destroyed by sin
tidus quickly befriends a group of guardians who are escorting a summoner yuna on her pilgrimage through spira at the end of which she hopes to defeat sin
the games quest follows a pretty linear patheach character of the game possesses the ability to go into overdrive mode after taking so many attacks
initiating an effective overdrive attack isnt as simple as just pushing x and watching the lightshow
nope
with characters like auron your truly badass fighter reminds me of cid from previous installments of ff you need to perform button combinations within a set amount of time
depending on how well or lucky you are the amount of damage inflicted increases
you quickly obtain most of your party
this includes a mage lulu another blitzball player surferboy wakka kimahri yunas guardian since birth and eventually rikku an albhed three racesfaiths in the game guado yevon  albhed and of course auron tidus quasistepfatheri dont want to spend a lot of time discussing the graphics since its a given theyre going to be pretty damn good
your world is a complete d environment
in fact you dont have a worldview map that you wander throughbe this a good thing or a bad thing depends on who you are
your characters are richly colored almost reminiscent of chrono cross and actually have voiceovers for their dialogue yep this is new to the series
luckily the acting is as bad as most games out there
and youre going to swear wakka reminds you of one of the characters out of shenmueabilities are handled in a completely new way
as a player youre now able to determine kind of the path your character is going to take
this is done through a system coined sphere grid
at the end of each battle your characters can earn sphere levels as well as different types of spheres mana power speed ability etc
the sphere grid is this table of interconnected unfilled spheres that contain different attributes
you spend sphere levels to move across the grid and place spheres in empty spaces to obtain more attributes skills or spells
now this isnt as easy as going in a straight line rather there are times when youre going to need to backtrack to gain abilities or raise hpmp
its best that you plan ahead before spending your sphere levels because once youve spent them youre stuck until you get moreas an aside the game offers the chance to play blitzball from any save point that is once youve earned this ability
blitzball is basically a sidediversion since there are really no sidequests per se
the game also offers you the ability to recruit blitzball players for your team the aurochs
i really didnt spend too much time with this since the blitzball matches are pretty primitiveone of my longstanding complaints about the final fantasy series has been how encounters are handled
in previous installments battles took a considerable amount of time to initiate and complete
square has quickened this process up some but you still have those random encounters that can become infuriating if youre not into fighting for every step you take
a decent job has been done at tapering this some
it feels as if a lot of work went into integrating your battles into the actual story of the game
forget wandering around until youve leveled up enough to continue in the gameas far as rpg titles for the ps go this is another owner however i must put forth that the game time is significantly lower than previous installments
its also not as indepth as previous final fantasy titles
to me it feels like square is getting its feet wet on the ps but not completely jumping in
thats unfortunate as so much could have been done with the world of spira
one plus however is that ffx resembles some of the colorful traits of chrono crossat least this was a plus for me
the game feels like an rpg designed and drawn by a surfer in california or hawaii
final fantasy x is another trendsetter for the platform
we see square push through a decent storylinealbeit linear and introduce us to another lovely world with intensely archetypical characters however it remains plainly simple compared to some of its predecessors especially last years final fantasy ix which was a nice return to the original theme of the serieswhat have you done to final fantasy
i rember a time when this game was fun final fantasy it is the best game ever and part  is good but its the worst game out there and part  wow i love it it took be back to when i st saw cloud jump out of the train and beat the shinrabut ffx is bad in a way it has a great story and better gameplay but the changes made are so i wish square would had stayed with the ffff ways
ffx could have been betterbut after ff final fantasy is dead untill ff then the series recovers from the changes of ffi wonder what ff will be likethough all games in this series seems to be a hit the final fantasy series is hit and miss with me
this is one of the hits for me
if you like traditional jrpgs you will love this one
i found myself lost for many hours at a time in this universe
the main story arch is engrossing and there are also plenty of fun side quests along the journeyfinal fantasy x is another spin off of the greatest epic in rpgs
this is the first final fantasy game for the ps
ps uses dvd technology which means only one cd and more cool stuff
let me start of with the voices
yes the characters have voices which can get annoying and their lips never match what they say but still cool
another feature is the sphere grid
this is an entirely new feature and its awesome
with the sphere grid you use many spheres that you get from fighting and from chests to increase your characters hp mp attack
plus you can learn magic skills and other cool things
the best part about the sphere grid is that you can learn anything you want to learn
a fighter can learn how to use black magic or a black mage can use white magic
the sphere grid allows you to do many things with youre character and supplies you with endless amounts of fun but you do have to fight
anyway the story so far does seem kind of strange and it deals a lot with religion and stuff like that but still its pretty interesting
there still are flaws though every game has them even final fantasy games
in ffx there is no world map which kills all exploring and you cant change camera views which can really  you off when you are trying to figure out the cloisters of trials
the cloister of trials are not to much fun either
overall this is another great addition to the final fantasy seriesi got through the game with ease some parts i did not
mainly with seymour the st timeseymour flux and the last battle with yunascela
the videos were excellent but i thought this mainly went around destroying sin but got caught in other details
tidus is pretty weak in the begginning
auron lulu and yuna are the best completetion of characters
still im trying to get another secrect aeon still am confused on that part
what is up luluthough
i reccomend buying this game
i am not the true ff fan i have only played  and  even though ff was really childlike still played it
i hope the next one will be even betterthis was one of the first rpg i have ever played
this game introduced many concepts to me on how gaming should be
i read many reviews on how people hate characters or believe its too linear from other ff titles
i didnt understand those concepts or cared really back then
this was my first beer or rpgpros
i really believe this story of all ffs i have played is the best
the corruption of religion the summonings are actually strong and the protagonists and antagonists are actually interesting
the graphics back then blew my mind away
i was used to playing baseball games or playing twisted metal
the only other title that could compete with graphics was mgscons
i really didnt like  of characters on this game and it was wakka and riku
i just despised their personalitys and how they could be so relaxed when at any time they could be blown to kingdom come from sin
i felt the story length compared to other rpgs i have played was kinda frail
it only had a few sidequests for a few addional summons ultra weapons and of course omega
i felt it could have been expanded someoverall this was a good beer to this day brings some good memories
this game provides  hours plus some serious good boss fights requiring some thought process but you will be fine
game on my fellow gamersoverall final fantasy x is a good gamecertainly better than any other rpg for a bit console
however final fantasy devotee that i am i cant help but whine about several quotsinsquot that squaresoft has commited with the making of this gamegraphics instead of using adjectives ill just put it this way sometimes you cant tell if youre watching an fmv or ingame graphics
theyre that good
the fmvs themselves are almost as good as the graphics in the final fantasy the spirits within movie
note the detail in the eyes hair etc
one thing that id like to point out that will greatly increase your enjoyment of the game is that fact that for the first time in a final fantasy game you can quotsavequot almost all the fmv sequences so that you can watch them again
search the city of luca south of the save pointsound if your tv has really good sound i have a sony trinitron flatscreen then youll be able to marvel at the realistic sound of grass crunching under tidus feet in the calm lands etcmusic this is where i start to dislike final fantasy x the music is nowhere near as good as  or  or even  and definitely nowhere near as good as  however there are a couple good songs quototherlandquot imagine ifrit trying to sing in a rock band quotsuteki da nequot japanese feel to it better than quoteyes on mequot and quotsummon monster battlequot an excellent battle tune but you only hear it once or twice
many times i took out some of my other rpg soundtracks best of ys elemental gearbolt ff ff ff tactics because their music is so much better
you can listen to the entire soundtrack in the same place where you purchase the fmv movies in luca another plus to this gamestoryline the very first scene is slow and boringnot at all like the openings to ff  and  but the fmv where sin attackswhew
amazing
unfortunately i found that the storyline in this game was dreadfully linear along the lines of go to temple solve puzzle get aeon go down road go to next temple repeat
you can go forwards and backwards and thats about ituntil you get to the sidequestsbattle system excellent
in previous ffs certain characters got neglected because they were pointless to have in your party
in ff x you can change characters in and out while in battle
in addition to this ff x uses the sphere grid which allows you to customize your characters the way you want totransportation dreadful
you get the airship only to find out you cant fly it
instead this list comes up and you choose from this list where you want to go
in the background is a world map showing where you are and where youre headed
but you cant see where youre headed because the world keeps spinning and the text gets in the way
you can ride chocobos but nothing beats a good old fashioned airship
flying the airship is one of the parts that every ff gamer looks forward to
also the airship themewhile flying itis usually one of the best in the gamewhat really angers me playing the game for  hours trying to get the magus sisters only to realize that you need anima but to get anima you need a special item in this temple
but you cant get to the temple bevelle
if you dont do it your first time too bad
and the thing is like final fantasy  you almost need the most powerful summons to take out braskas final aeon
ultima flare and holy are not what theyre supposed to betheyre rather weak and not much eyecandy
this game is very popular in the barracks where i live but i know of many that have resorted to cheat codescharacters tidus is whiny and annoying yuna is little miss goody twoshoes
auron is a copy of toshiro mifune in the black and white japanese akira kurasawa movies quotsanjuroquot and quotyojimboquotwhich is why hes so coolthis is the first ff to use voice but i wish they hadnt
part of fantasy is using your imaginationdont get me wrong this is a great game with a great story and battle system
but the game is so linear i could draw a line through it
whatever happend to explore on your own
then extreamly bad dialog of yuna and tidus is annoying and corny
the first half of the game is mostly cut seens then fighting afteri played the demo for this game and it was good
the main person in the game is tidus but you can name him any way you want
the battle system is cool
and when you sumon a monster instead for the sumon doing just  attack like ff the sumon stays in the battlethe sumon does go away when it dies
but once again the cussing kept me from giving it a  the graphics are very good
the miny games like blitz ball are fun but they can get fustrating
over all its a fun gamei randomly picked this up at a local blockbuster and went out and bought it the next week
i have never really been a fan of video games but this truly enraptured me
i have completed it entirely once and am halfway through my second game
the plot the action virtually everything is amazingmany people complain how there is no world map but i prefer it to ffvii which i tried more recently and found myself aimlessly running around a grassy plainit may take a while to get into but this game has a brilliant story line and intricate details that i have truly come to love
you wont regret this purchasealthough which ff game has the mechanicallybest battle system is heavily debatable ffx has the bestimplemented battle system of the entire series except possibly for ff tactics
the battle screen in ffx loads quickly battles are bugfree remember the mblock stat and dark status bugs in ffvi and the turn system in ffx takes into consideration character speed and execution time for moves in order to determine when to give each character another turn rather than working in battle rounds like in ff  the result is a battle system tactically similar to the atb system except which allows for easy character and equipment swapping and features no delay between the selection and execution of a move keeping the battles moving along at maximum speed
the quality of battle action animations are at a series high in this game and overkill bonuses plus the ability to fight using aeons give the player extra battle mechanics to consider just when hacking and slashing start to get a little dull
although originating in lunar the inbattle voices in this game add a lot to it with what characters say in battle often determined by the opponent or combination of characters in the party rather than merely the move being executedthe voice acting in ffx is generally highquality although the abundance of voice acting serves to disguise the fact that the characters have much less to talk about in ffx than in ffvii through ffix
like ffvii ffx often features fiveminute cutscenes filled with dialogue although the actual amount of dialogue present in five minutes worth of voice acting is significantly less than in five minutes worth of text boxes with the final result being that ffx features a shallower story with less character development
the games story has an annoying pattern of explicitly emphasizing moral dilemmas which should already be obvious to the player ex dialogue such as is it really okay to hate the albhed
 overemphasizing the emotion of particular scenes nobody could believe that yuna was about to call the final aeon and that meant and allowing its characters to act too much like themselves wakkas continued objections to disobedience towards yevons teachings even after exposing yevons corruption
after the reasonably mature stories of ff this games story comes of as positively childish despite featuring a good amount of philisophical content regarding the nature of death because the dialogue is written with a constant degree of paranioa that the player wont understand the significance of certain scenes and most of the time the characters exist not to interact but rather to be different from one anotherone particularly annoying flaw in ffx is the field exploration screen where the edges of navigable areas do not in any way correspond with the position of walls and barriers so the majority of the time field avatar tidus is exploring a dungeon or forest until he runs into a barricade of absolutely nothing
this causes the player to spend more time looking at the minimap for the position of the abstract walls than the field screen for the position of the illustrated ones and actually discourages the player from enjoying the level of detail that the illustrators have put into the games environments
the music in ffx while not bad is also unspectacularthis is the first of the final fantasy games i have played and most likely will be the last
the game although beautiful in graphics and story line was sorely lacking in actual game play
it felt more like watching a movie and periodically getting to push a button intermitently to strike a foe
i buy games to play not to watch
there were some side games that were interesting but the turn based combat left me wanting much much more
i really enjoyed kingdom hearts which was based on final fantasy characters along with disneybut this game left me disappointed at mostthe bottom line to thhis game ispros  awesome graphics
awesome gameplay
addictive funcons  boring plot
bad voiceovers
very cheesy and childish at timesok everyone knows the graphics are incredible
thats to be expected from a final fantasy game
but the storyline is truly epic
it even rivals the masterpiece final fantasy vii
the sphere grid is a bit odd but new innovations such as being able to control aeons or being able to switch characters midbattle more than makes up for it
the voices are wonderfully done
i must admit i was a bit nervous about what it would sound like
the characters are interestingespecially once you find out the scoop on them in zanarkand i wont give any spoilers here
then to top it all off this game has the greatest ending ive ever seen in a final fantasy game
it is totally breathtaking
i cannot wait for ffx
buy thisgreat game and in good condition
ill definitely be looking for more ff games in the future
a good rpg gamenice graphics great story but you need to invest way too much time to play
forces you to take on tedious tasks just to get through the game
this is of course the norm for rpgs but couldnt someone design an rpg where you can speed up the process of building experience etc
if you are an rpg fan you will no doubt love this game as it is a crown in its genre
if you are not an rpg fan or you never played an rpg before you will probably enjoy this game but beware that you will need to invest a lot of time to get that enjoyment out of itthis game is one of the best games ever dont listen to those other people who say its bad because they have no tasyte for good games a must haveit has been a long while since ive played any console game let alone a console rpg roleplaying game
i started out as a console gamer when i was younger but for the past several years ive been a die hard pc gamer
however recently i decided to get a ps because of its now lower price and absolutely massive game library
as a fan of console rpgs in general and final fantasy games in particular i just had to play final fantasy x when i got my ps
having played through final fantasy vi aka
iii in north america vii and viii i wondered how final fantasy x would stack up especially now that ive had a lot of exposure to pc rpgs
quite simply this game me glad to get a ps
its one of the best rpgs ive played in some time for any platformfinal fantasy x revolves around a character named tidus a smartaleck athlete who is sent  years into the future to save the world of spira from an evil creature known as sin
throughout this game you will encounter an interesting cast of characters such as auron a battlescarred swordsman lulu an attractive and powerful magic user kimahri a humanoidlion creature who likes to let his spear do the talking wakka a blitzball player who finds a kindred spirit in tidus rikku a young al bhed girl and yuna a summoner who can call forth powerful creatures called aeons and will eventually become tidus love interest
final fantasy x does a great job of fleshing out these characters personalities so that you feel more invested in the storys outcomethe core gameplay of final fantasy x is similar to most other console rpgs
battles consist of random encounters with monsters that your selected party of three must defeat
each character in this game has their own distinctive attributes
auron for example is a physically tough warrior who can take and dish out a lot of damage while lulu is physically weak but makes up for it with strong magic attacks
one of the more original and admittedly oddest features of this game is its character advancement system
unlike pretty much every rpg both pc and console final fantasy x does not use a simple level up system
instead when you win a battle against monsters you will gain spheres which you use to activate abilities and stats on a characters sphere grid
it took a little time to get used to it but this system soon became second naturegraphically the game looks phenomenal
the background environments are much richer in detail compared to previous final fantasy games
also the character models are themselves incredibly detailed and this is especially noticeable during the ingame cutscenes when the characters talk to each other
and of course squares signature computer animated cutscenes look as amazing as ever
through this i could tell that the makers of this game spent a great deal of time to ensure that final fantasy x would be visually stunning which is a good thing in my bookswhere this game falters a little though is in the sound department
music wise final fantasy x provides a decent selection of music when not engaged in combat reflecting the different environments you encounter in the game
however when in combat the game plays the same battle music over and over again and it only really differs when you fight a boss creature
eventually the battle music started to get annoying
the voice acting in final fantasy x is a first for the final fantasy series and on the whole i thought it was okay although it isnt going to win any awards
in my opinion the best voice acting job was done by aurons voice actor who gave him a very strong and somber tone
on a related note being a fan of japanese animation and foreign cinema i would have actually liked the option to choose between having the english audio language and the japanese audio language with english subtitles
although i know this would not be possible due to memory constraintshowever the main problem with final fantasy x although its a small one is the fact that it is a very linear game
unlike other rpgs such as the baldurs gate series for the pc or star wars knights of the old republic final fantasy x allows little deviation from the main story of the game
basically there is only one real way for you to go from the storys start to its finish
but you know what
thats fine with me
one of the main reasons i liked playing the final fantasy series is that it always told a compelling story which final fantasy x delivers in spadesin the end if you never liked console rpgs or the final fantasy series in the first place final fantasy x doesnt really give you any reason to change your mind
but if you are a fan like i am you owe it to yourself to pick this game up
with some good music fantastic graphics and an enormously gripping tale this game has a lot to offer
final fantasy x definitely lives up to the legacy of its predecessors and is a game that shall be remembered for years to comemy ratings aregraphics  sound  gameplay  overall  this is a good game
i dont think its as good as iv vi vii and ix but it has enough going for it to make it fifth best in this long running exellent seriesgameplay it still has a couple of things that ive never been a fan of from the series like too linear and way too easy but it has improved on a few things as well
the biggest leap ahead in the right direction is the battle system unlike past games its blazing fast and is the first one in the series where i wasnt tired of fighting near the end of the game
i thought the ability to swap characters during the battle was great a great addition too
as for the sphere grid its pretty good
i wouldnt put it up there as the best rpg system ever but it works great for this game and is a nice change of pace from the same old stufffirstrate text localization as well as a decent english dub at some points its annoying or laughable but overall id say its good enoughone thing that you know you will always get with a final fantasy game is a lenghty adventure the game itself will last around the usual  hours but the sidequests took me about  hours and some leveling up added  more hours
the hardcore players can easily get  hours out of this game and the more casual players will still get a good  hour adventuresound they took a new direction with the soundtrack this time and for the most part it works
even though i dont like the newschool sound nearly as much as the past games
as mentioned above the voice acting isnt bad but it could definitly improvegraphics these are great graphics
it looks a little sloppy compared to the games that are out now but thats only because it came out a little over a year ago
for its time it was near the top of the pack and while its not there anymore it still is a great looking game
one thing that hasnt been touchedon ps and might not ever beexcept by square maybe are the cgms
computer graphic movies these are the most beautiful things ive ever seen on a game and would impress anybody
i think the closest thing that comes to it is resident evil that has the more realistic look to it though so its hard to compareoverall  starsi bought final fantasy x since ff the series had seemed to be going on a downhill slope
i actually skipped purchasing ff because i heard so many criticisms of it
i bought this mostly on a whim in the used bin of a local game store
i took it home and it waited patiently while i finished out ff played through kingdom hearts and attempted to master tekkenfrom the first opening movies of the game i was hooked
this is a gorgeous game with great streaming video and it also has innovative character development a nomess combat system and decent voiceover work
unfortunately the first few hours are part of the reason that i cant give this game five stars its too narrativei dont mind a completely linear game where you go from point a to point b to point c on until you get to point z the end of the game provided that those intervening points are interesting diverse and most of all entertaining
in the beginning ffx tries to tell us a story
this story is complicated by the fact that it cant ruin future events it cant tell us about some past events and it cant even let us know just whats happening right now
rather than short snippets of story though we get long tedious narrative characters talking about the same things over and over and over againtowards the end of the game once all the history has been hashed out and the course of the characters destiny seems set the narrative dies down to just the occasional snippet of conversation which is fair more pleasantdont get me wrong though the plots great its just has a little too much 
presencethe sphere grid that motivates character progression is an inspired idea
different spheres increase your attributes like strength magic hit points while others give you special abilities or teach you spells
you can also pick up special spheres that enable you to teleport around the map learn spheres on the far side of the grid or add spheres where none existed before
as a result while each character has his or her own set of spheres to start out in the latter levels of the game you can go just about everywhere
send alreadyspeedy tidus through rikkus grid to make a speed demon
send wakka through aurons grid to make a superstrong ranged attacker or send him through lulus area to pick up a backup spellcasterall in all an excellent gameas the other games in the series i very much enjoyed this game
right from the start you can see how amazing the graphics and which continue through the entire game
the story was different and intresting and the voice acting was okay at times and bad at others but still brought the final fantasy games to a new level
however this is where the games start to seem too easy
i very much enjoyed playing this game adn leveling up but it never wwas much of a challange i died once in the game and it was easy to figure out where to go and at times there was hard bosses to me the hardest was when you fight sin on the airship which was the only time i died in the game but after that the final bosses just seemed to be a joke in difficulty
i love a good story in games which is one of the reasons i love the final fantasy series but i also enjoy a challange so this one could have been betterbut it is still a great game with amazing graphics and a intresting story and worth playing more than one timefinal fantasy x is ok until like midway through
the voice overs get worse with each passing scene the plot gets lamer and lamer and theres only like one halfdecent character in the entire game and hes dead
well ok so final fantasy x is ok at best
d and ok works for many people other than meeeeeee the last two ff titles before this one didnt reach the groundbreaking fame that ff vii had
after playing ff ix which was the greatest waste of hours in a videogame ever i tried ffx with little anticipation
true enough the first few hours explained it all the horribly linear exploration cutscenes that are ridiculously long and unskippable and the fmvs no longer gave me the awe like previous ff titles
but then i couldnt bear to quit the game just like that
and as hours goes by i was in awe of this gameadmittedly the storyline is not for everyone but definetely it is away from the love story cliches of previous two titles
okay our party still has to save the world from some incoming catastophre
basically the story of ff x is the most intellectual of all
its metaphor behind it is a prosecular theme and advocates rational thinking amidst blind faith and blind obedience towards authorities
freethinkers can see that yevons teachings represent religion and its followers as church authorities
the albhed race were pretty much despised because basically theyre more intellectual because theyre creators of machina and also are race that did not adhere to yevons teachings
later on in the game players will discover deceptions unveiled and characters will be immersed in rebellion and instability that hinders their quest to annilate sin
yes yuna and tidus did fell in love but thankfully square kept the romance from degenerating into a bollywood love festanother amazing thing about ff x are the numerous sidequests and secrets thatre addictive since ff vii
monster arena and blitzball are the main attractions of ff x along with chocobo training
by capturing monsters all around spira for the calm lands monster arena players can battle several new creations of monsters thatre guaranteed tough to beat
blitzball and chocobo training or chocobo racing stores essential items for creation of ultimate weapons and boosting stats
apart from these minigames there is so much to do in ff x getting hidden aeons customizing weapons experimenting rikkus quotmixquot overdrives and even boosting an aeons stat
all of these will involve at least hundreds of hours to fully maxing up your characters and aeonsthere are flaws that rendered this game from getting a star rating
firstly the cutscenes are long and unskippable except occasionally the text and i cant bear the thought of replaying the game just because of the cutscenes
last but not least and most griping flaw controls
in battles pinpointing enemies and characters are cumbersome and annoying and an easy task such as casting a spell becomes a chore
some times you couldnt pinpoint a certain minor enemy because the controls keep highlighting you characters and bosses
the controls affects the minigames and it becomes a nightmarish hell
two quests butterfly catcher and chocobo balloon catcher are hellishly hard and the controls are no relief at all
even better you will have to beat these minigames in order to fully upgrade you characters ultimate weaponto end this review is this game worth it
the story might not be everyones cup of tea
but if the theme appeals to you and you love a good gameplay then ff x is for youi think i was more moved by this game than any film or game
i will carry the memory of final fantasy xs story with me foreverthat story which affected me so strongly follows the brash blitzball player tidus who is thrust into a future world besieged by an enigmatic monster called sin
this new epoch is dominated by the religious dogma of yevon which teaches that sin is sent as punishment for the use of technology
against sin are the summoners powerful magicusers who can call upon divine monsters called aeons to battle their foes
tidus joins the summoner yuna and her guardians on their pilgrimage to a hallowed site where they hope to attain the most powerful aeon and defeat sinthe story is excellent and the characters are absolutely alive
tidus is impudent but grows into a dignified hero yuna is fragile but strong of spirit kimaris fierce and taciturn demeanor hides the heart of a cavalier wakka is gentle brotherly rikkus cuteness is entirely charming lulu is a morose enigmatic woman and auron perhaps the games most fascinating hero is mighty in battle sadly mysterious and wise with experience having served as guardian to yunas father years ago
this is the first ff title to feature voice acting and sterling is it and the stunning graphics never cease to amaze
look closely and you can read subtle emotions by looking into a characters eyes
you feel a closeness to script that wouldnt be possible were you just reading it off the screenthe worldbuilding is perhaps the best ive seen
each area is meticulously rendered this time all in d to kill the static feel of the previous ff titles amort environments
squares artists have designed fantastic architecture which lends credence to the worlds exotic quality
the monsters are designed with such impeccable detail that children may be fooled into thinking such creatures exist
but the worlds fascinating nature extends past simple graphical brilliance it extends into the ideas behind the world itself
the world of final fantasy x is encapsulated by an arresting mythos that could drive a series of games on its ownthe traditional methods for building your characters has been scrapped in favor of the sphere grid
instead of detailing its mechanics i will just say that it works wonderfully  you are given the opportunity for huge customization but your characters need never sacrifice their distinctive flavor
the combat system has been polished to a mirrorlike gleam
each character adds an important ability to your battles and you can now switch party members in and out combat on the fly
the atb system is gone entirely  battles are now completely turnbased but accelerated by speed and intensity
the nature of battle is intrinsically more strategic this time around which i like
the roll of summoned allies has changed as well instead of calling them for a single devastating attack and dismissing them you actually control them as if they were another character
when they unleash their super attacks called overdrives prepare to the absolutely floored by the overthetop imagination of squares artistic team and the graphical juice in that ps of yoursthere are reams of secrets for those who wish to pursue them
secret dungeons equipment bosses aeons and the player can even learn another societys alphabet letter by letterproblems
sure
the blitzball minigame is morbidly annoying but necessary if you want the all the best items
the game is extremely linear until the end where you are afforded plenty of freedom to explore the games many many secrets
there is no overworld map which to me took away some of the feeling of exploration
the sphere grid makes it a bit difficult to gauge relative power levels of your party membersbut who cares
i dont think youll be bothered by any of this when your heart is warmed by the blossoming love between tidus and yuna
i dont think youll think about it much when you are swept up by the characters triumphs and tragedies
i dont think youll care when it hurts so bad at the games finale that you think im fighting back tears and this is only a video game
if its not the greatest thing ever its pretty darn close
actually spocks beard is pretty sweet tooi love final fantasy
but lately i just wasnt able to get into it
the ps games while they had amazing stories had battle systems that made me insanely angry
the artificalfeeling panic of the atb battle system is gone and the battle system surpasses ffvs i love the job system its just that the battles were too much like the others
the story is very good for the most part with some good touches on dealing with rascism and predjuduce
the characters are good but i dont agree with square on this one they just had to make lulus chest that big but what can you do
the sphere grid is perfect for those that are tired of quotleveling upquot aka anyone who plays rpgs alot but didnt appreciate the very freeform job system of ffv
the story does fall short in some areas while the gameplay is the first rpg in a long time that i can call addicting but you feel like the story is just tacked on and not a lot of work went into it like in the other editions although they did improve gameplay a lot
voice acting is good wakka and auron are the best kimarhi sounds to gruff and lulu sounds too calm and tidus can be whiny
rikkus is second worst her toocute voice makes you want to puke after a while and dont get me started on her overusage of quotya knowquot
yunas is the worst with a gaspiness in her voice that just lets you know that the voice actor really didnt care
graphics are amazing but i dont care for that
backtracking isnt a big deal to me but you do have to go a long way to get secret stuff
the worst thing though are some of the sidequests if you try to get the legendary weapons and their powerups then be prepared for a lot of wandering and random battles
its not impossible just unimaginably annoying
ill do a list to put it into perspectivepros most addicting rpg gameplay in yearsgraphicssphere gridbattle system revisementsmusiccons most of the voiceoversannoying parts during sidequestsstory falls short in some areasrandom battlesthere are annoying parts but the pros outweigh the cons and thats what counts
it is the best overall final fantasy with a very wellrounded experiece even though parts of it fail to compare to other games ffvis story characters job systems etcthe game is fun and exciting
if you like real video and graphics this game if for youi have to start off by saying this is the first ff game i played and didnt know quite what to expect
in fact when i first put this game in i turned it off after about  minutes or so of not getting anywhere
i didnt put it back in until several months later
i had to force myself to play through the beginning and when tidus first meets rikku simply because it was so boring
in fact the game really didnt pick up until tidus meets wakka and then finally the games gets good
no not good amazingthe graphics on this game were awsome along with the voice work except for tidus he was kinda a goof
the game play is standard turn based which was new for me because this was only the second rpg game i played first one being xmen legends  soon i understood how to play and it was not difficult at all
in fact its almost boring choosing an attack and that person doing itunlike the shadow hearts series where the judgement ring determines the outcome of an attackthe story is really interesting though
its about a summoner and her guardians on a quest to stop sin which that has a surprising twist to it
i wont say too much but tidus is in for a suprisethe cut scenes are beautiful and the voice acting as well
the only bad thing is you arent able to skip a cut scene and some of them are rather lengthy
so if you arent interested in the cut scenes the only thing i can suggest is getting up and getting a snack and hopefully they will have ended when you get backthere is this thing called the sphere grid and in order to move spaces and aquire new skills and what not you have to participate in battle
each character had to make at least one move during the combat or else they dont get any moves on the grid
thats alright because you can instantly change out any party member with some one else and them put that person back inunlike some other games where you can only change out party members at a save spot or by talking to a certain person  you can also choose the path you want a certain character to go on the sphere grid whether you want that person to use white magic black magic be a theif whatever you can decidei dont recall there being many side quests in this game but the ones i do recall were quite involved
like wakka and the blitz ball
i personally could not stand the blitz ball and never played it unless i was forced to do so
then there was capturing the monsters you fought and the monster arena which was cool
it gave you some great rewardseach character was equipped with a certain weapon like a knife a blitz ball something unique to that character
you were also able to customize that weapon with different things such as petrify or slow so long as you had the required items to make that weapon
my personal favorite was no encounters which allows you to go from point a to point b without engaging with the enemy
why would anyone want that
well when you get further into the game and go back to one of the early spots for something the monsters there arent even worth the time to stop and fight unless youre trying to capture them they dont give you much experience points or gil
or if youre simply trying to get to a save spot because your running low on health or magic having the no encounters on your weapon is great
and of course you can always switch weapons when ever youre ready to fight againeach character is well defined and they have their own purpose for traveling and fighting against sin
even the npc are awsome
speak with all the npc you can and you come to find out they are rather supportive of the lady summoner and often give her and her guardians nice surprisesi have to admit i was some what dissappointed with the ending
i wont reveal it but i will say it was bitter sweetenough said go play the gamedefinately not the best in the series but its still worthy
pretty good story between tidus and luna
the graphics as expected are great
the story at times was laking but still decent
the only things i didnt care that much for was some of the dialogue and voices especially wakka blitzball was a pain and the final boss way to easy they couldve done so much more with that
overall this is still a good game its nowhere near as good as  but still enjoyablefinal fantasy x is one of the best if not the best game in the final fantasy series
the graphics are sweet and so is ability to teach your characters every ability
the battle system has made it much easier than past final fantasy games to level up and achieve the maximum with all your characters
the aeons all look good but after playing for some time you might wonder why isnt odin on here
finding the hidden weapons can become hard if you do not have some idea how to get them such as finding the weapons using the airship
another constant pain is catching the monsters for the old man toward the end of the game
most monster that he splice with each other are tough and can not be beaten unless ultimate weapons are in possession and attributes are at maximum
the ending is probably the best ending of the series because of the way it leaves off you can tell the will be a sequalthis review is for final fantasy x aka
ffx the first final fantasy game to beset the sony playstation  and the fourth in the numbered series since squaresoft now square enix began working on the sony home consoles the playstationfinal fantasy x had the job of carrying on the legacy of the nintendo entertainment system aka
nes or famicom and nintendo family computer in japan the super nintendo entertainment system aka
snes and the sony playstations final fantasy games specifically final fantasy vi final fantasy vii final fantasy viii final fantasy ix which many fans of squaresoft and final fantasy consider to be the best of the series
i believe it both disappointed and satisfiedgraphicsthe graphical quality in final fantasy x was obviously better than that of the prior games considering the sony playstation was only a bit system and the sony playstation  is a bit system
the graphics in final fantasy x leave nothing to be desired
they are almost flawless looking next to the graphics of past final fantasy titles
many of the characters look so well done that they could jump right out of the screen at you
gone are the days when the background looked wrong behind the characters
the character designs no longer look cut up and pixelly but look much more realistic even next even to the improved backgroundflowthe graphics have a smooth blend of lighting and texture to create some of the most realistic characters and settings ever in a game
few jagged angles and warped designs make it definitely the most visually appealing final fantasy to date
few load times and smooth transitions between different scenes are also a plustexturefinal fantasy x kind of failed a bit here
it had such a high polygon count that at some points the characters appeared to be some what plastic
they look to smooth and have no realness
but it is rare and usually unnoticedfull motion videosfull motion videos or fmvs aka cgi computer generated image or even just plain cg are a given in recent final fantasy games and the ones in final fantasy x are as amazing as ever
many of the fmvs almost seem to come to life on your screen even more than the real time
pushing the limits of a system as always square made it so we will very likely never see much better graphics than these on the playstation  though many complain about the excess of them totaling over  i find them well done and smoothly transitioned to the realtime graphics
and really youre either watching a cut scene or fmv which would you rather watchthere is also an option in final fantasy x for you to buy for the price of  gil each the fmvs you have watched throughout the game in the form of spheres the main powerenergyvideo in the world of final fantasy xin game and cutscenethis is another problem with final fantasy x final fantasy x uses three separate models for the in gamerealtime cutscene and fmvs so the characters look nothing like there counterparts in the different forms of video
but other than that it is still breathtaking and well done
the new emotion engine is really well implementedtotalgame playthe most important part of any rpg the game play
final fantasy x completely redoes the old game play systems of the recent final fantasys a whole new battle system a new way of leveling up no world map etc
for some this may seem horrible and make them think square enix ruined the series but i find the innovation is what the series really neededgame play  generalgone is the day of the world map
final fantasy x offers a full environment with no points where you have to press x to enter no areas on a map smaller than you nothing like that
the game is quite linear but it in no detracts from the story quite the opposite it adds to the story
and most final fantasys are linear
at certain points of the game chocobos are ride able but no more ranches and it costs to ride but not muchgame play  storythe story follows a young blitzball the sportminigame of final fantasy x player in his journey through a new world as he accompanies a summoner on her pilgrimage
simple right
wrong but youll have to play the game to find out the restgame play  charactersthe characters are very well done you can really feel their struggles
they dont seem false in any way and have very good back stories
you can come to really almost know why they do the things they do and it rarely feels out of character for themgame play  battlesa totally new battle system called ctb or command time battle is used in final fantasy x although not totally turn based just like atb it is a step in that direction
each character has a turn but how many they have and how often is dependent on their speed unlike in turn based where each character has one turn the everyone else has one then the first character has another one
you have as much or little time as you want to choose what attack or action you want to use which makes for a very good systemthe level up system is basically scraped for the sphere grid
the sphere grid is made up of nods which raise your abilities and attributes
with certain spheres you can unlock nods like hp  or strength 
it leaves very little room for customization early on but later becomes on of the most customizable systems ever as you move into other characters gridsin this game weapons and armor are customizable and this is a doubleedged sword
it is hard to decide which way to make your weapon with all the decisions and it also uses items but customization can make you immensely stronger and the game immensely easiercharacters are now switch able whenever even during battle think pokemon and the switched in character has the attack
nice huh
summons are now also controllable and are your greatest ally in tough battles
even better is that they have limit breaks now called overdrive and it can be saved the same as the characterstotalsoundtwo words for you voice acting
that is right
the first final fantasy with voice actors and actresses aka
vas is on the sony playstation  and they do a brilliant job
and the music is not bad eithervoicesthe voice actors do a wonderful job and you can really feel them portray the characters emotions
the script is well written and also helps to portray the characters
the actors were well chosen for there roles ad fit quite well though many complain about some of them having highpitched voices but that has yet to bother mematching with mouth movementssquare really could have done a better job on this
many of the scenes look like bad bad bad foreign kungfu movies
the words and the moths do not match at all unlike other square enix games with voices like kingdom hearts
though you can press the x button during speech to cause them to stop talking altogether but the game script will not go any fasterbattlesthis may seem like a weird section to put under the sound category but not so
during battle the characters will say certain catch phrases like while fleeing you might say catch you later
this really adds to the over all quality of the game and is a definite plus
and the battle music is no let down either thought it is similar to past titlesmusicoriginal scorethe music of final fantasy x is amazingly well done
it is probably some of the best music of the series
the sweeping music really fits with the scenes and can make the difference between just another scene or just another place and a spectacularly done area
final fantasy xs music is really awe inspiring andamazingly well donemusic can also be bought in the form of spherestotalcontrols  cameracontrolsthe controls are petty similar to final fantasy ix in many respects and are quite easy to pick up on right awaycamerathe camera like in previous final fantasies is uncontrollable but it very rarely causes a problem for the player
the only problem ive had is sometimes when it is to far zoomed out it is hard to see sometimes which is normal in most recent final fantasystotalreplayfinal fantasy x has very little immediate replay value due to it either being a very long game or the plot being slow to pick up but it is always a good game that is easy the sit down and play with a medium challengebuy or rentdefinitely a buy you can not really experience the full game without a much longer time then a simple rent would allow
though if you are unsure it is a good idea to rent it first but make sure to play through a good part of the game or you will miss out on a lotprosamazing graphicspretty good character developmentgreat storygreat musicgood controlsgood cameraconsshort on the real story partcharacter model differencessome overused musicoverused enemy designsvoices do not match up with mouth movementstotalgraphics game play sound controls  camera overall to start things off if you were anticipating this release of this game prepare to be disappointedwhen rating this game there is no choice but to refer to other final fantasy games so here i go
due to the superior capabilities of the ps the graphics have shifted from halfsprite characters on a prerendered background to an indepht rendered on the fly scene
i personally miss the old style a bit but i guess it is for the betteras far as the mechanics of this game they are almost perfect
the characters and their stats could use minor tweaking and the item systemreturn to damage based solely on strength is awful
however ctb replacing atb turn based but turns are based on speed and actions you choose the ability to switch characters in battle the sphere grid replacement to leveling and blitzball are all pure geniusthe main problem with this game would have to be the smaller less frequent towns which are much smaller and the lack of a world map
you dont get any kind of world map until the end and even then all you can do is choose the destination
i miss the good old days of exploring the world map and having it tie into the story and takes away a certain je ne sais quoiif you are a fan of the ff series this is a must buy game
however if you are a first timer i would suggest ff vii viii and ix
in my opinion they are all a bit more wholesome and all left me with a better feeling than this gamethis game has the most amazing graphics out there
the rendering gets better and better every game in the series
final fantasy x takes place in the world of spira where your party with tidus in the lead has set out to defeat quotsinquot in an attempt to bring peace back to the world
ff has everything that youve become used to throughout the series thieves blue mages summoners items towns etc
the game also introduces the new sphere grid systems that allows you to customize your characters and control their advancement entirely
you event control when they receive more hp mp agility speed etc
all of the characters still have their own unique abilities that are specific only to them though such as summoning stealing etc
the game also introduces character voiceovers that further lure you into the game its nice to hear characters instead of just reading what they saypros great graphics
long involved story ability to use all of your characters in battle not just three or four wonderful music uematsu still is and will always be amazingcons theres more story and cinemas than there is gameplay hard to master sphere grid system characters lips dont match the voices of the actorsoverall not as good as some of the previous ff in the area of story telling but still worth buying and playing through  i would rent it first before buying it though just to be safemy gosh i wanted a video game not to sit through hours and hours of video
im glad that they brought in voice acting but the cinematics were too muchi was leery about playing this game because in the past i have found final fantasy games hard to get into
i was pleasantly surprised because instead of trying to pack everything that you need to learn right at the beginning of the game you learn as you go along
the characters were interesting even though most of them had really annoying voicesi enjoyed the game play with the random monster fights and the boss fights
i was annoyed by the cloisters of trials had to get the cheat book eventually before i snapped the stupid game in halfthe animation in the fmv was beautiful it made me sad that theres not going to be a movie that i know of anytime soon
the cut scenes were amazing showing how far ingame animation has progressed where the cutscenes are better than fmv used to bei cant wait for the sequel
i hear that the gameplay is different but similar to kingdom hearts another great gamedo not listen to anybody who gives this game less than  stars
sure it is not perfect but that is all relative
compared to other rpgs or what comport to be rpgs since no one makes a true rpg anymore final fantasy x is leaps and bounds ahead of the competitionmy only complaint is that the spirit and pain of the earth concept has run its course
recent ff games seemed to try to develop their own religion more than convey and inspirational tale
i wish square would return to a story writing similar to the original final fantasy or final fantasy ii with just crazy madmen trying to rule the world not destroy it and more emphasis on the kings castles knights etc
you can still have magic and summoning without all that fighting for nature against the evil mechanized encroachment of man
that story has been repeated so much in the last few ffs that it has become a theme
it is time for square to grow the story line as they have grown the graphics and character development
either that or they run the risk of having their own success constrict them into stagnant stories that become predictable and staleevery once in a while a really great game comes along and blows away any other competition for a while
final fantasy x is one of those
perhaps sensing that number  ought to be something tremendous and groundbreaking square has put a great deal of detail and care into one of their masterpieces
the story is rather epic and full of grandioso but it suffers from some unintelligibilityof all the games in the ff series  is truly the most tragic
the dialogue is rarely redeemed by even a happy thought and while not excruciating there are clearly some bits  but not many  that should have been deleted from the final version
i would have preferred that the dialogue sequences be shorter
there are at least three that go on uninterrupted for ten minutes
you can certainly pause and come back to it if you need a quick break but why bother
you wont really miss muchfor my part the story seems to be a jumble of thoughts and one gets the feeling that the writers started in one place intending to end at the appropriate spot but got sidetracked and ended in another
there are several parts where it feels like the sequence of events  if one may call it a sequence  is cobbled together
which is really a shame because it is a great gameffx is a good game but the plot is so messy and it really does hold your hand the whole way through
a game from which so much is expected can disappoint even the most dyedinthewool player
there are many good things going for the game including the sphere grid  a system unmatched by anything else in this jenner  and the blitzball game
the music is great and the imagery as always is fabulous
the cg scenes though few are also very good in particular the first sending that yuna performsif you liked any of the previous ff installments or if youve never played a final fantasy this game will excite you
it has great replayability and i never tire of itas a bonus the translators of square finally learned to spell all right as two words and with two ls something never done in previous games
that alone is worth the playthrough
the authors composer and all the crew were called to the footlights before the curtain fellthose games would be five star games
this one is a still amazing  stars
i cant recommend it enough though
this is the best rpg on the ps
you want better
regress back to the original playstation and play final fantasy  and  this is one of the best final fantasys that i have ever plalyed i would have to put it up there with  and  two of the best games i have ever played
the graphics are so good in this game i think that it must have the best graphics that i have ever seen on any game
some of the parts almost look like that final fantasy movie really it is that good
not only the graphics are good but the game play and overall everything about this game story battle system
the only thing that was a little different from the other final fantasys is that there is no world map that you can go on and save that way
it would be like playing and going through a dungeon but it is not really a dungeon
overall i would say that this game is really good some parts are easy and some are a little harder
another cool thing about this game is that there is a little mini game inside the game called blitz ball
i even think that would be worth buying the game just for thatfinal fantasy
these two words make any hardcore gamer giddy to the core
a legion of fans follow this game series wherever it goes and for good reason
the entire series for the most part are the most intriguing innovative and fun games to play
ff x takes this all to new levels
the graphics as usual for a game developed by squaresoft are above almost other games
the story deep an thoughtful or shallow but fun
its however you decide it to be
if you like stories that defy reality youll enjoy this its fantasy after all
if you only go for realistic games the story may taste a little sour
the characters are ones who are truly human
tidus the main character isnt your typical hero
most of the time hes lost in the new world hes in
yuna is religious nut who doesnt even know why she follows but tidus helps her find out the truth to her false religion
wakka is as human as they get
hes racist towards the al bhed which have hot chicks because they disrespect the religion of yevon
hes also a sports nut
auron is the character most people like the most
hes serious funny and a bad bad fighter
he takes out most the monsters you encounter
lulu while in a questionable outfit is the most down to earth
kimahri he seems to be just there but you bond with him anyways
rikku is the hot blonde chick all the guys who play this will like
beyond the characters lies a very deep an easily used battle and level up system
in previous final fantasys experience was gained through battles well it is here too but u choose what feature you want to level up
the actual battles themselves are fun
boss battles are difficult make sure you save before you fight those
youll know when one will happen
those take a few trys but make sure you know how to level up at the beggining of the game and youll do fine
if not i had to buy a gameshark to beat it i reccomend it only because if you want to know the end of the story an you stink its the only way you can get by
sound is easily listened to and the voice overs are well done and fit nicely to the real time facial expressionsall in all if you want to buy a game superior to almost everything in the market here it isthis game is a lot better than final fantasy x
it has a very interesting story and aaaaaawesome graphics
some parts were too easy and some were hard
but i definitely think you should buy this game
its worth the money
and at times can be very addictingno but close
final fantasy x introduces a multitude of new features a new storyline obviously and takes full advantage of the pss powers
the only thing that disapoints me is the ending and some of the annoying voiceovers
fans of final fantasy should not hesitate to buy it while casual gamers should rent it and take it for a spinthe first thing that impressed me about this is how beautiful the graphics are
id say they are just about on par with the final fantasy movie and far beyond anything ive seen in a video game before
squaresoft seems to have treated the development of this game much like a movieof course this has its downfalls as well
much of the game seems a little too linear and that the parts you actually play are just ways to pass the time between video sequences
the gameplay itself can be boring sometimes and isnt very improved over the way older final fantasy games worked
this isnt necessarily bad but i personally prefer the way the battles worked in chrono trigger and chrono crossfinal fantasy x is interesting though and definitely worth checking out
like all final fantasy games it has a great story that drives you to want to play it just to see what happens next
unfortunately it also drags in the gameplay like most rpgs as well
still the mundane battles between bosses and fmv scenes is a fair price to pay to see what is going to happen nexti have never played a role playing game ever
the closest i came was zelda on the super nintendo
when i think of roleplaying games i think of games designed for losers living in their mothers basement watching star trek reruns and playing dungeons and dragons
at some points of this game i felt i was way off and some points i thought i was right
everyone said this is one of the greatest games ever created so i had to at least play it before dismissing it to the realms of geeks and nerdsthis game is gorgeous long annoying yet ultimately rewarding
at some points of the game i wanted to throw this game away while at other points i wanted to play it nonstop
throughout this game i wondered why i bothered buying it and other times i wondered why i hated earlierthe first thing people notice is that in the beginning and throughout many places this game represents more of an interactive movie than a game
the first two hours consist of like  minutes of game play
i initially hated this game
the scenes seemed garish puzzling and long and worst of all could not be skipped
you have to watch all the movies no xbutton skip here
then about five hours into it when the game play showed itself and my eyes grew accustomed to the garish japanese anime type movies i started to slowing get engrossed in it
after a while i got annoyed when the movies started to become less frequent
the puzzling story and environment slowly becomes unraveled along with the histories of the characters
what ensues is an engrossing lavish spectacular story full of good twists and animations
one of the main pluses is that it takes places on a group of lush tropical islands instead of the depressing typical dungeons andor medieval town that i associate with rpgs
the only thing that annoyed me was the somewhat ambiguous ending
i played this game for a long time  i wanted a concrete ending that was worth my timewhat makes this game enjoyable is the lush tropical surroundings and imaginative characters
the scenery itself is worth the price of the game
the backgrounds are spectacular and really shows what a game could do
one major gripe i had was the japanese anime stuff especially the females
it seems like they were designed by frustrated perverts who flunked out of art school
its embarrassing having someone walking in while im playing this game
they could have dressed the girls in a more conservative costume and made some of them not speak like junior high school dropoutsthe fighting sequences are the meat of the game
though monotonous at some points its still pretty good for what it is
its turnbased which seems almost sacrilegious to me but after i while i really started to appreciate the use of strategy involved
the fact that the fights are really won by good reasoning as opposed to a quick thumb is pretty cool
though some of the bosses are pretty hard with help from the internet i never had to fight a boss more than three timeswhat was really enjoyable was that it took into account one thing that hardly any other game does  fair progression
if you work hard and fight all the monsters in the beginning it pays off in the end
though some bosses seemed impossible the fact that you progressed steadily along with the continuos learning of the gameplay nuances really comes out
many games start out easy with the only way to win at the end is to go through some cheap trick cheat or pass some impossible jump
this doesnt rely on that annoying formula at
also when bosses seem impossible going to the internet can offer many hints on the bosses weaknesses and strengths and can aid you but not win it for youunfortunately this game has many flaws
the most noticeable is you cant save it any point in the game
since you dont know when youll be able to save it you dont know if you can go to sleep within a few minutes or within an hour
i really hate that
my schedule is sometimes tight
i dont want to block out a two hours of my time and only play for ten minutesanother thing is that its just way too long for a normal game
ive got a job
this is not the type of exciting game that can be played for ten hours straight
if you play for an hour every night it would take two months to pass this game
i have a job and a life
if i didnt have an injury that kept me indoors i would have never finished this gameone thing that annoyed me was that youd have to talk to someone or walk into a room for the game to continue and many times the game wont say what to do
its a minor annoyance but really got on my nerves since i spent time unrelated to the gameplay or moviethe last gripe i have is that the game also tries to incorporate other things into it
most notably puzzles and blitzball
the puzzles are dull and boring and dont fit into the game
unfortunately you have to go through them to continue
blitzball is terrible
its some futuristic turnbased made up game that is just plain stupid
a turnbased sport is pretty lame by itself
a made up game is even worsedid i enjoy this game
yes very much so
would i play it again
not on your life
would i get the next game in the series
no way
this game is not a mainstream game and it shows
too long and too weird for most peoples taste
unless final fantasy  is more in tune with the average gamer squaresoft will still be bleeding moneyprosgorgeous  bright and imaginativelong story is gripping actually worth itprogression is fair  no cheap tricks or cheats requiredextremely polished professionalconspuzzles are worthlessits really too long of a gamenewbies struggle for a little whileblitzball is the lamest thing on earththe females should be better representedcant save at any pointambiguous endingnot designed for normal gamershours to pass  hoursdifficulty medium to hardannoyance level highyes this game was amazing and had gorgeous graphics and even a good storyline to boot no ffvii though
the game sheds a lot to be desired such as plenty of side quests secrets and mini games
the music is loveable the characters memorable
the problem where this game falls short is replay value and gameplaythe games graphics are truly amazing and are by far some of the best weve seen on the ps
the textures and mapping is great and this is the first final fantasy game to be in a completely  dimensinal world and i mean entirelythe characters in the game are memorable with great developement and personality
you have characters with mystery and characters with intrigue
a small love story in there
i feel however that square didnt focus enough on the love story as much as they did in final fantasy viii
not a bad thing though when the kiss came it was just a couple of hours before the end of the gamethe games involement is much better than in any other previous ff game
raising characters is entirely different from the series
now you must make your characters obtain quotsphere levelsquot
this was probably the best idea since the job system introduced in ffiii or the materia system in ffvii
either way instead of gaining exp
like your traditional rpg you gain ability points to help your sphere level go up
once it does it starts over and keeps building up
once you gain a sphere level you have to move on the quotsphere gridquot and actually use that sphere to learn an ability increase your stats etc
not a bad idea though this does bring the difficulty down by a whole lot and makes it successful to beat the game in  hours and there are some who dont even increase their stats they just learn the abilities
the battle system is different from previous ff games
since final fantasy iv weve all grown used to the atb battle system
now you have the ctb system
this means control turn based
basically its a turn based battle system with a twist
you can switch characters in and out of battle
you also have a ctb guage that appears in the upper right hand corner of the screen
thisll show you when enemies attack and when your characters attack
should you select a spell like quotslowquot or quothastequot youll see what the adjustments do on the ctb guage
the problem with this is the same as the sphere grid the game is too easy with this
the ability to switch characters in battle is also a good idea but again too easythe games downfall is the gameplay and replay value
the game moves at such a slow pace with cinematic scenes in which more than half youre unable to skip
they dont last long but they come every ten minutes or so and that time does add up
thus this makes the game lack for replay value
the game also has predictable plot twists but none the less its a good storylinealso while the music is lovely the voice acting isnt too good
itd have been much better if square had let us choose whether we want subbed or dubbed
the voice acting is in deed nothing specialthe game cleary doesnt give off too much difficulty and while it is an amazing game it is by far the most quotdifferentquot final fantasy in the series
the classic blue background is gone some people actually do care about that
the classic atb battle system that weve all grown to love is also gone
not to mention that as the final fantasy series goes on the games get easier and easier
this one is no exception
its downright easyoverall the game is pretty good
it is better than viii and ix but it isnt better than vii and the ones before
the series has lost some of its classic edge with this one but that by no means suggest you should degrade iton the positive sidesmooth lavish graphicsnice musicgreat storylinenew battle system that allows more strategythe most unique way to raise characters eversquare finally got some voiceslots of minigames and sidequestsbut on the bad sidenot enough replaytoo many scenes of watching rather than playingvery easy gameits actually short compared to todays standardsthe voice acting is not the bestsome of the elements that made final fantasy quotfinal fantasyquot are goneoverall this is one of the better final fantasy games
those whove ben there since ffi may not like this one quite as much but i assure you this is a great gamethis game is really close to a  but it has some problems
first to clarify ffx isnt really a rpg but more like a dungeon crawl like a diablo ii with a very detailed storyline
your path is clearly mapped out on what to do next even has an actual arrow on the mini map to get you going to the next areastoryline and i think there will be hardcore rpgers who would object to this forced structure
you also cannot skip the cut scenes at least i couldnt and some of these are lengthy  at times it seems like youre watching a video with some breaks for actual gaming rather than the other way around
the plot is also weaker than other ffs although still well presentedhoweverthis game will completely floor you with just the graphics
it looks pretty good when youre exploring the world backgrounds are very detailed and during dialogue scenes but it will hit you every time you see a prerendered cut scene is played just how unbelievable this game looks especially using svideo or component out
there is a lot of dialogue and cut scenes so if you didnt care for it to start you might not want to get this game  im really impressed at how much work went into it
this game is big easily  hrs but youll find yourself trying to just get to the next stagethe sound is very well done and the voice acting isnt bad
the combat system is phased turn based and pretty tactical when your characters gained a few more abilities
there is one member of you party rikku who can actually customize weaponsarmoritems and imbue them with additional properties btw i would suggest adding poison to every weapon you have if a creature is suspectable to poison it does a lot of damage each round the creature remains affected this often does more damage than any one of your characters main attackany weapon equiped wthe ability sensor will instantly tell you the hp of the energy and any immunities or weaknesses it might have
although you can only fight at most wthree members of your party you can swap the backup members in instantly to fight
this is important since each of your characters have specialitiesabilities that would turn the battle for you
being able to reequipt a characters weapons amp armor midbattle is also usefulthen of course even with a game as linear as ffx there are mini games and some side quests just try and find all the books to translate the al bhed language
there is the blitzball game like water polo where you can actually recruit players and play a season and the ubiqidous chocobo gamesi think if youre a big fan of rpg you may want to rent this game out first
otherwise this is a must have game and a very worthy representative of the legendary final fantasy name ff is still the best though  thats a  in my booki am so glad that i played this game and gave it a chance
i had been losing faith in the ff series every since ff got popular 
this game was a lot more fun then i thought it was going to be and i really did like the new characters  and the crazy back story
i kind  of wish though that there was more story that happened on the first island  wakas home town i thought the island was really pretty
cool game and game play good story and nice relatable characters
thumbs upwhat can i say about this game that hasnt already been said
theres the great graphics excellent storyline and suprisingly fun battles and minigames
who doesnt love playing underwater volleyball with some hawaiian dude whos team name is the aurochs
the only drawbacks to the game are the sometimes cheesy voice acting mildy overdone cinematics and the fact that you cant get anywhere if you dont completely understand the sphere system from the begginingi had to start over because of this
all in all this game is worth at least a rental to average gamers and definitely a purchase for rpg fansfinishing the game without a walkthrough made it all the better
although saving it at each save point makes it easier to go back and find those items that you didnt find before
graphics  was completely amazing
less pixelating from the previous machine but it was amazing then
sound  nothing too much more amazing but actually hearing the players speak makes it more fun to play
although trying to speed through some of the talking is difficult
control  good same as the previous nothing new here
gameplay  the story is missing something  perhaps it was the movie sections that dragged but i still believe ff was the best one for storyline
gamer to character interface  excellent you can control up to  players and you can move them in and out of battle one of the best ideas to help advance each character evenly
interesting new quotlevelupquot idea
kind of makes it easier the sphere grid nice one word of advice for the game is make sure  of your characters have the same itemsmagicweapons status
the game was all in all easy but very pretty to watch
unfortunately ffx should have added animated blood
it would have been more enjoyable from my stand point
cant wait for ffxi interactive gameplayas the rumour goes
total rating i would say its worth having as part of your ps collectionit took a couple hours but eventually ff  turned into the best final fantasy i ever played
the combat system is great
you can switch characters in and out of battle and you dont even waste a turn doing it
the sphere grid was scary at first but eventually i loved it because leveling up only lets you increase one stat but you level up much faster so it seems like you are making more progress
unfortunatly there is only one disc
i actually liked four discs because you felt like you achieved something when you beat a discthe plot is great because the characters wont neccessarily have a happy ending when they defeat sin so the plot has a much different feel than other ffsit all came crashing down when you get the airship and do sidequests
final fantasy sidequests are typically tedious but these sidequest have minigames that you will spend hours trying to beat
some of the most frustrating moments in video game history happened here
i admit that i get mad more easily than most thoughstill the good outweighs the bad
it might have been as good as ff  or  if not for frustrating sidequestsfinal fantasy x was a great game so long as you can ignore tiduss continual whining and his obsession with his story
it sets you into an interesting plot and puts faction against faction in an exciting story which rivals many of the stories of previous final fantasys
it was also the first final fantasy to include talking so it added something new to the whole seriesthe character models were beautiful as well along with the music and the story was filled with a large selection of mini games to choose from
generally it was a solid game and still would be fun to engage in todaydefinitely worth playing if you havent alreadyive been using this controller since  slightly after we bought our first gc
its a little clunky but nothing to complain about when compared to other rd party gc controllers
the mini version is a little bit small after a while and my hands start to hurt but if you can snag a new one under  or a used one in good condition under  why not buy a decent back up controllerit works loud on the rumble i have small wide hands but it works and for the price hey i am okayi really soemtimes can never tell when a good controller can come from a third party company
largely because most of those controllers are never suggested by the regular companies
that is where mad catz really has those major companies going in circles
this controller for the nintendo gamecube is very simple and easy to operate
it is also a bit smaller in size but carries out very well
there arent any fault with this controller
i like it because it is inexpensive and convient especially if you cant consider another partner to play with for a nintendo original gamecube controller
this is a real must buyprice aconvience b overall bwelcome to the octagon
this is an amazing mixed martial arts game fighting  wrestling where you can chose from  real athletes from the ufc roster like tito ortiz josh barnett dan severn frank shamrock mark coleman mark kerr
each fighter has a different fighting style such as jujitsu judo karate pit fighting freestyle wrestling and submission styles
so you can pick a fighter suited to your playing style such as some fighters have devastating punches kicks and combos others have grapples takedowns and submissions and still others have enough endurance and stamina to keep coming back
this game is different from wrestling games and its more suited as a fighting game with its fast paced and quick matches of  rounds of  minutes each
the gameplay is easy and very smooth as there are four buttons right kick left kick right punch left punch then from there you can press right kick and right punch simultaneously to do a shoot dive in and press left kick and left punch to do a takedown
with a shoot and a takedown you mount your opponent in true ufc style either to beat them up with the punch buttons or slap a quick submission on by pressing a combination of buttons
it really only takes  minutes to learn how to play
to block you merely hold back and the game offers so many combinations of punches and kicks to create incredible combinations
the name of this game is aggression because the matches are so fast paced you can finish the matches in a matter of seconds with either a knockout or a submission
with submissions they happen very quick so once you get a submission you immediately win but expect to be countered or blocked from the submission
the fighters are huge on the screen the graphics blood and animation of this game are great and you can even hear the crowds comments however these are all one on one fights so players may get bored quickly with the lack of matches
this is more of a fighting game than a professional wrestling gamehaving just bought this game today i havent had a chance to take full advantage of all the characters yet nor have i mastered most of the moves
however i am very pleased with this game thus farthe games graphics are excellent and the fighters move at a believable speed
the game will be even better after you master a particular fighter and find a worthy opponent
i can see a lot of enjoyment coming out of the twoplayer feature of this gameon the negative side some people might be disappointed with how quickly a fight can end
even if your fighter has full strength if he suddenly gets caught in a submission hold its over
the biggest problem is probably the complete lack of direction from the instruction manual
you have to stop the fight to see a full list of your characters moves and even then there is no real information on what the move is  the game just shows you what buttons you can push to do a move and not what that move may bea suggestion i would like to make for future versions of this game would be the inclusion of a training mode where you can see every move your fighter can do while working with a quotdummyquot fighter
overall i am still very pleased with this game
people who were let down by the pitiful quotwwf rawquot might want to consider giving this game a trythe reviews to schizm varying from the positive to the dismally negative only make clear one simple thing we all see and hear complete different things in the same object
so schizm has a very bad acting
yes
schizm has very difficult puzzles
yes
and then
for me schizms world is one of the most compelling i ever saw in a computer game similar to riven under many aspects but more surrealistic
if you like to explore an endlessly fascinating landscape if you like a slow and meditating pace if you dont like ridiculous inventorybased puzzles but love to try to solve tough but not impossible logical puzzles then schizm is your game
in any other case if the shooters are yor cup of tea well give it a wide berth
luckily in the world theres place for anyone and for every idea and taste
for me schizm is already a classic and by the way the dvd version is really betterboy what an appropriately named adventure game
the title schizm a bastardization of the word schism myst  mist schizm  schism get it
 was probably meant to reflect the main twist of the game
the division or separation is realized by the ability to play the game through the eyes of either of the two main characters one male and one female of course that have been separated not only by location but also by surprise parallel phases
your job is of course to try and reunite them into the same phase while also trying to find the original inhabitants of the world in yet another alternate phase or some suchon the surface this is a pretty neat little twist to the typical first person adventure genre and for the most part it succeeds in setting itself apart from the rest of the pack
but i think there is another schism lurking beneath the surface a small one between this games reality and its true potential of being the alltime best adventure gameit came so very close to fulfilling that potential at least the dvd version almost did
the dropdead gorgeous d graphics alone vault this game into the upper echelons of the genre
to date i think only exile rivals this game in sheer beauty
add to that a lush music score some truly great puzzles to solve and some killer cutscenes although the living ship once you get it to move looks too monty pythonish to me
 you are just a breath away from being on the top rungthen there is the character acting
so many times these game designers have poured so many resources into their graphics music and game design only to be tripped up by the amateurish actors they get to portray their characters
timelapse is the classic example and unfortunately schizm is much worse
every time one of these characters popped onto the screen to try and tell me something about their plight i just cringed
it got to the point where i didnt really care about them and had no incentive to try and save them
even the occasional observations by the two main characters made me wish that they would just shut upmy last small gripe belongs to the conveyance cutscenes
most of the time the animations traversed you only about a quarter of the way to your destination and then faded to the final quarter of the trip leaving out about half of the journey
maybe the designers had to do this for space considerations but it drove me absolutely nuts
i so wanted to experience the entire journeys at least once the skyride from balloon to balloon being a perfect example
then on subsequent journeys from place to place and you do have to do that a lot it would have made sense to allow you to skip the full animations with the spacebar or escape keymy dream is that they will release an extended version of this game with the full cutscenes and better actors
then it truly would be the best of the best
a sequel is in the works to be released later this year mysterious journey ii chameleon
im keeping my fingers crossed that it will be the onenow let me say something right now i fully admit this game is terrible
but for some reason theres a strange aura it creates that makes it somehow a joy for me to playthe game has you running about in universal studios japan riding the different attractions there in the form of minigames and collecting letters that spell out universal studios and stamps for the attractions
there are a total of  attractions back to the future backdraft et jaws jurassic park and wild wild wild west
theres also waterworld but thats just a small clip of the finale of the waterworld stage show that you can view from different angles trivia questions about different universal licensed movies and woody woodpecker themed puzzles
instead of these minigames being chosen from a menu they have you traverse the park in order to get to them
the park is huge so as to mirror its real world counterpart
the problem is that the camera sits in one position ala resident evil  this makes differentiating the areas somewhat difficult and easy for one to get lost
although there is a map it doesnt show where in the park you are only the locations of the attractions
speaking of the attractions when you start a new game you can only ride one attraction before you are forced to buy a cap in order to have unlimited access to one attraction
the reason you need caps
there are lines
yes you heard me right there are lines
and you cant even wait in them either
theyre just there to keep you from riding the attractions without a cap
once again about the attractions they take the form of minigames as i said before
heres what you do in each mingameback to the future you ride in a delorean chasing after biff who has stolen another delorean
you have to bump biff yes bump biff multiple times until his hp is depleted
you go through different time periods such as future hill valley the ice age and the prehistoric era while on your chase much like the ride it was loosely based uponbackdraft a factory has caught fire and you must go in and rescue the civilians trapped inside with a  minute time limit
you can use your fire extinguisher to put out small fires blocking your path
the problem with this minigame is that it uses the same camera system you use in the actual park thus making it hard to get around
plus the factory is huge making it difficult to find most of the survivors
this is the only minigame i have failed to completeet
 you take the role the main character of et
did in the climax escort et
on your bike to the ship that has come to pick up et
the gameplay is similar to excitebike you ride a bike from an overhead view with ramps and obstacles you must overcome
however it is very easy to fall off your bike and be stunned for about  seconds making this tedious
theres also a time limit but unlike backdraft you can make it before time runs out very easilyjaws youre on the orca and the shark from the film whos referred incorrectly as jaws is attacking it
you must pick up various barrels and boxes on the ship and throw them at the shark before he destroys enough parts of the orca thatll send it to davy jones locker
the problem here is that due to the abundant amount of barrels on the ship its difficult to make your way around until youve thrown enough of them off of the shipjurassic park youre on the back of a jeep driving through jurassic park and you must shoot different dinosaurs that come up to attack the jeep with a laser turret
although shooting dinosaurs with a laser turret does sound awesome this game goes on the longest  minutes
its the same stuff then shoot up veloceraptors along with the occasional pteradactyl with the occasional press x button to not die section
however i should probably mention that this is the minigame that i have gotten the most entertainment out ofthe wild wild wild west you duel off against  gunmen in a game of shooting targets
the cursor in this minigame moves rather slow in comparison to the opponents cursor thus making this minigame a pain on higher difficultiesall in all this is an abysmal game for most people
it has clunky controls confusing maps mediocre minigames barely relating to the source material they were based upon
however for me this game is a guilty pleasure
i enjoy reliving my favorite universal movies in the form of these minigames and i enjoy how much the universal studios in this game looks like its real world counterpart universal studios japanthis one had better graphics then n and the mini games are fun
my friends and i enjoy playing turns on the mini games and we try to spot the most trash and the most letter tiles
this appeals to gamers  and under
it appealed to me because i meet that quote
this is a good game and i tend to play it again every once and a while
so i would not highly reccomend this game but i would recommend this game for minigame fansif you buy this expecting another master of orion  as i did youre in for some disappointment
the game is far less intuitive has a much steeper learning curve and offers less immediate reward than its predecessor
however if you stick with it for a bit and get used to the games emphasis on bigpicture control rather than micromanagement youll find a very rewarding startegy game with lots of replay valuetwo things cost it its fifth star
first therees a lot of bugs
second the ai leaves something to be desired
still its well worth it especially now that the price has gone downhuge fan so my review is biased just wanted to say that if your only reason to buy games is for the graphics then this probably is not the game for you
eqs engine is a bit dated but im not a huge fan of flash over substanceeveryone concerned with the requirements for the new engine let me just restate what people have said before me the engine is scaleable
yes you can still run this game on a high end pceleron with megs ram as long as your video card supports dx usually a free driver update is all you need but really people with semidecent low end geforce cards going for money and ram at money for megs whats your excuse for not upgrading
more ram  less disk swaps  happier computer verant recommends megs bit high but check out the next gen games coming out
even the sims vacation a seriously old game but a good game requires a p now used to be a pentium  minimumverant customer support is only negative thanks to the internet anyone thats accidentally destroyed an item then gone postal at verant demanding this or demanding that ends up getting the book thrown at them verant documents their item replacement policy very explicitly on everquestlivecom
ive had the occasional problems but ive found that a petition and a polite email to the powers that be will get the items replaced
granted it may take time but i have much respect for the guides and gms on eq customer support they work hard for little thanks and every one of them is a pretty cool personyou get out of the game what you put into it
there is a lot of depth and substance in eq problem is that its not conveyed really well but if you have no life and a lot of spare time on your hands the world of norrath is quite fun to explore and hang with peopleremember this game can be highly addictive and even after  years with  soon to be  expansions its still hard to put down
some other things to remember verant doesnt control the internet
if you get lag in the game do something about it
call your isp run a trace route on your connection
not all isps are created equally get out there do the research find the best isp for gaming and thatll probably help
you get out of the internet what you put into it bugs are in the game but there are bugs in every game out there believe me daoc  played it loved it stopped playing at level  why because there was nothing else to do
graphics are nice i love the setting but darn if i wasnt bored outta my skull
yes im an eq fan but like i said daoc is a great game im a beta tester from eq verant had  beta rounds with everquest where we got to wander around and help with bug finding and i still playnice addition has bugs but vi will work them outits a commonlyheld maxim in the world of videogaming games based on movies are either really really bad or really really good
this one definitely belongs to the latter category
as a serious oldschool gamer as in d is all the dimensions i ever need and onedimensional platformers have served me very well thank you i expected to not like the game very much
but i was pleasantly surprisedmost of the timeby the intuitive controls and fairly uncomplicated button combosalthough the dialogue can at times be repetitive there is something reassuring about tobey maguires almost constant speech
the oneliners are classic comicbook stuff and willem dafoe is wonderful reprising his green goblin role from the filmbest stuff  the aerial combat which takes a little getting used to but is very fun and rewarding
 the veryimmersive storyline which nicely expands on the movie
 spidermans abilities are varied and great funnotsogreat  some indoor areas are far too dark
 some of the levels are way too shortall in all a very good game a musthave for fans of the movie and comicsthe greatest things about the game spiderman are its graphics its depth and its gameplay value
the graphics in the game are the best ive seen in a long time
when you are webslinging you can see every detail on the buildings and even on the ground
this game is also very deep
controling spiderman and trying to catch sounds sipmple right
wrong
you also have to get new combos for your fighting and practice on those combos
while there is a pretty long storyline there are also little minigames that you can get after you complete a certain amount of levels
spiderman is one of those games that after you complete the game there are still many reasons to play it
there is only one big problem with spiderman and that is its level of dificulty
this is a very hard game to beat and gets harder every time you beat a level
i havenquott even beaten this game
there are a few minor glitches in the game but there is one big glitch
when you are webslinging the web almost never attches to a building it just goes straight up in the air
overall this was a fun game and i acnt wait for the sequelspiderman is perhaps one of the greatest super heroes of all time
in the traditional marvel manner the character is deep a very good comedian too
spideys toungeincheek humor is very well represented here albiet by voice acting that is a little on the bland and dry side which has me worried becuase i hear that toby mcguire the actor playing him in the movie provided the voice for the game
although bruce campbells narratives are great the voice overs for this game could have been a lot more energetic
ive always envisioned spiderman as a fast and energetic talker and although spideys humor is more than present the game is very funny the lack of energy behind the dialogue is disapointing
the story for this game is a bit vague and choppy but i supose that is because this game is beating the movie its based on to the market and so they dont want to spoil the film at least thats what im hoping for
if the movie is this choppy ill be sorely dissapointed
game play wise it plays a lot like the previous spiderman games and it is probably one of the best beatemups in existance but there are parts that are very very hard
especially the time bomb chase down where if the bombs dont get you the hunter robots will
aside for that the game is very well paced and will actually get your heart racing in some places
i have not played a game with such intense action in a very long time
despite the dry voice acting please please please do a better job in the movie toby im begging you
and the lackluster story line the game is still very funny and intense and a definate worthy addition to anyones game libraryi wanted to play spider man the original version of it and im happy i have it
i will be easy at this gameyou know its rare to see a good game come thats based on a movie
i mean has anyone played the matrix
spiderman is a good game both as a comic book and a movie gamethe ability to web sling which is much better than in its ps and n daysis fun to do and is well implemented for the air battles
in fact im glad that they added the green goblin as a playable character because it forced them to rework the web slinging aspect of the gamethe bosses are believable and fun to fight
there are a few stealth missions and well implemented at thatand the bonus features
 costumes for spiderman can be used and the green goblin becomes a playable character as well
there is even a bowling minigame to unlockall in all a very good game for a very good characterthis game wasnt as good as the playstation version
the controls  are a little hard to controlthe good thing about this game is the loading times just take a couple of seconds
any way i have a code for the playstation version
i dont know if it will work on gamecube or xboxthis code will make you play the green goblin
i think its arhcaid
if it doesnt work then i must have spelled it wrong
heres another way to do it
go to any store that sells magizines
then find a psm magizine of the lord of the rings
then look into it
then you will find code of the month
and it will tell you how to play the game as the green goblinspiderman the movie for the gcn and other nextgen systems has very good points and less good pointsthe goodthe plot follows the movie pretty closely
it adds in a bunch of extra villains and activities that werent really in the film but unless you want the game to be two hours long theres not much else to do
but in any case its pretty goodthe graphics are far superior to the spiderman game released a few years back on the playstation
its clear that its built on a similar engine but everything looks a lot better
the outdoor levels in particular feature a very long draw distance and a very realisticlooking city skylinefinally the gameplay through most of the game is fantastic
the outdoor levels where you get to sling and swing your way across the new york city skyline are stunning
even the indoor levels look pretty good
and spidey is equipped eventually with a wide variety of acrobatic moves and an expanded repotoire of web abiliites such as pulling himself forwards while running towards a wall
you can also get a firstperson view making those tricky  swings and ziplines much easier
swinging no longer eats up your web meter making the outdoor levels much less tediousso whats the problemthe gameplay really bogs down in the middle of the game while youre trying to sneak into and investigate oscorp
there are several levels where you have to crawl around in the shadows without being seen and these stand in stark contrast to the nonstop action of the rest of the game
i found them to be mostly just a huge pain  especially when i opened one door in the oscorp offices and was immediately shredded by half a dozen combat robots
whoops guess i wasnt supposed to go that wayalso many of the levels seem very very linear
i know theyre trying to make the game accessible to younger players but there are other gameplay mechanics than quotoh no the bad guy is behind a locked door
find the key andor switch that opens itquoti am also not a fan of having to find dozens of hidden little items throughout the game to unlock all your abilities
i wish theyd just give spiderman new combos with each level and only hidden a few of them or have the hidden things be stuff like extra costumes artwork galleries etc
maybe its just mefinally what exactly are you swinging on in the outdoor levels when youre between or above buildings
just a thought
pas far as licensed movie games go its a winner  though there are better titles out there for the gcn
id probably give it  stars for its uneven gameplay but ill bump it up to  just for the fights against the green goblinpretty good graphics and some good battle sequences
yet i dont know if i had a bad disc or what but spidey wouldnt stand still
he would just start walking his own way if i let off the controls for a couple seconds
very disturbing
also got ridiculous seeing spidey swing himself off of clouds which must have been his leverage seeing how you are above building topsthe only problem in this game is that after you beat it its boaring
its defenetly good for a rental though
i beat it in about  hours with no cheats
the one on n is fun to
if you liked that one youll probably like it
and the gamecube version has better story lines and graphicsoverall it is a very enjoyable game
the game idea is so different from many out there todaygraphically the game was well done
the levels and cities are amazing looking and the buildings look clear and realistic
however there is a downflaw the people
mary jane the love interest in the real movie is played by kirsten dunst
well let me tell you the game does a horrible job making an animated version
she looks ugly thoughout most of the game and has a really really fake sounding voice
that probably was the only downflaw graphicallyas for gameplay the game is really fun but really hard
i see no way anyone could beat this game without some sort of cheat
i myself struggled through many of the levels and couldnt beat  of them
however the controls are easy to learn and very well thought outoverall this is a great game
the sound is also good and spiderman has a realistic voice to that of the movie
i enjoyed renting the game however am not sure if this would be a great game to buy
you can basically get everything out of it in a good week and after that it gets kinda boring
plus there is no multiplayer includedwhen i first played spider man on the ps i was blown away by the graphics and gameplay
when i got spider man the movie for ps i was equally blown away by the opening movies but then it all became quite familiar
the game boasts of being able to swing freely throughout new york but there are limits
if you go too far spidey will suddenly turn around in midair and say whoa where am i going
 and put you back the other direction
the controls are similar to the ps version and anyone playing it will have very little problem adjusting to the new game
its fun to play but often the camera angles are just impossible to work with batman vengeance has a button that automatically takes the camera to directly behind you if it gets too far out  i wish this one did too
many times i was fighting villians that were off screen because i was facing the screen and nothing i did would move the camera behind me
this gets frustrating very quickly
plus while you can see the streets below you dont think for a minute you can reach them
if you swing too far down and your guess is as good as mine on how far that is supposed to be youll suddenly find yourself dead
still this is a very fun game and i do like the fact that you can shoot webs at villians even while youre webswinging
a lot of good points to this game and i do look forward to a sequel hopefully with more villians in it
i especially have to complement them on getting the game out right when the movie came out rather than  months later after the hype has worn off like theyre doing with the new star wars games for ps
its fun enough so buy iti never cared much for the spiderman movies but i bought the ps for only a dollar last year at a thrift store
the game is actually a lot of fun to play with great graphics
a dollar well spentill give this game  out of  because the graphics are really enhanced with the d environment and the great spidey movement animation and the sound quality is top quality as well but spiderman himself doesnt quite strike me as the true comic superhero for people to look up to
not to mention hearing tobey magwire narrating throughout the game gets me irritated
like i said this is one of the best comic based video games for one of the best superheroes but i leave my praise as the best to wolverine and x wolverines revenge
that being the best game for a comic superhero for more advanced video game players to appreciate
i expect the younger and less mature crowd to appreciate spiderman and child oriented spidey games leave wolverine for the older playersman this game is so identical to the movie which i would expect
i had this game for the xbox but i like it better on the ps i know why would i repurchase the game well the ps speaks for it self
i must say that the most impressive thing about spidey is that despite the fact that it was a movie it make a heck of a gamethe xbox versions controls werent the best but it was okay i loved the movie and i love the game
my biggest piece of advice is dont buy the xbox version unless you have no other optionthis is an alright game
the story line goes along with the movie and the graphics are pretty good
but the camera control is can get annoying at times and the game is too hard for a game that is rated e for everyone
overall its an alright gamespider man for the playstation  is a game that walks a very fine line between being fun and being frustrating
as you probably know this game is based on the first spider man movie
you step into the role of peter parker as he swings through manhattan in his quest to avenge the death of one of his loved ones
oh yea and he also has to contend with the lunatic green goblin who wants to kill himat its heart spider man is founded almost exactly like its ps cousin that was a great game
you swing through the city of new york using the r button attack foes with your fists and feet spin webs and fight crime
but unlike the ps games the ps spider man is graphically amazing
the skyscrapers of new york really come to life like never before looking entirely realistic
planes fly through the air cars go through the streets far below
new york has never looked so good before
likewise for the charachters who all look great
peter parker in the game looks exactly like the peter parker in the movie
overall the graphics here are amazing
people talk about how poor the graphics are on ps compared to xbox but i have yet to see any proof of thisunfortunitly the gameplay of spider man is at best mediocre
and at its worst its hair tearinginly frustrating
when i started playing the first level i was a bit stunned at how bad the camera is
of course this is to be expected being that this is a spider man game but this has got to be the worst spiderman camera yet
it drifts as if it was on a swivel and it takes a long time to get used to it
the camera lock feature is a nice touch thoughthe fighting of spider man is very frustrating
any spider man fan knows that spidey can lift a semi truck over his head easily
if thats true then how come spider man is such a wimp when it comes to taking out certain bad guys
heres a helpful hint when playing the game
if you see a thug with a gun run
the thugs with guns are withought a doubt the most frustrating enemies in the game
they fire guns very fast at you and they can block your attacks simply by putting thier arms up
and worst of all they can take upwards of ten of your most powerful combos before they die
this is beyond frustrating
this is beyond infuriating
this is so frustrating that words cannot describe it
in the third level after i died the sixtenth time after fighting three thugs with guns who kept saying mess with the skulls you pay da price
i wanted to shout oh yeah
you can cram that c up your  well you can probably guess where that went
i got so mad after my thirtieth try that i almost broke my controler by slamming it on the ground in frustration
you read that right
the game made me almost broke my controler
in ten years of playing video games spider man is the first game that made me damage my controler out of frustration
thats not a good signbut i dont want to paint an excessivly poor picture of this game
some of the levels are a lot of fun to play such as air duel with the vulture and face off at the bridge
there are also nifty cheats that allow you to play as various charachters such as a policeman a thug even shocker
theres a code that lets you shrink your charachter down to about ten inches tall
theres even a alternate story line where you play as harry osborn in the green goblin outfit
and bruce cambells narration is hilarious
when you hide in the shadows the bad guys wont see you
muhawwwwwhhaaa
likewise the actors who played the green goblin and peter parker lent thier voice talents to the game and both do a superb job at itin the end spider man is enjoyable but it comes within a hair of being bad
i recommend renting before you buyi really liked the games but i would like to pick out the pros and consprosdetailed controlschallenging gameplaynumerous fight stylesconscamera angles slow to respond at timesgets old soonto much like your old spiderman gameso eventually it game out three pros and three cons
but i think it still deserves  stars
so if games never get old for you and you dont and you liked the old spiderman games then get it
if you didnt than dont get itspiderman is funthe first level you can go around the cityso much funand force a guy to tell you where spike isthe title says spidermanthe movieit really is like the movie is like the moviethe other  is missions not from the moviethe bosses are not hardi tried though on the hardiest difficulty and green goblins  or very hardstart on easy or medium if your starting a new gamethis game is longi think theirs  levels though most reviews say like  levels because they eitherhate this gameare very stupidfailed mathrent first then buyeviolencebuilding on their success with the surprisingly good spiderman games on the ps activision and treyarch managed to craft a great game based on marvels resident web slinger
the games storyline more or less follows the plot of the smash hit film while incorporating extra villians from the comic like shocker vulture and scorpion
the graphics minus a few glitches and frame rate slowdown are otherwise phenominal and give a great looking new york city
spidey himself looks great and animates very smoothly
if you enjoyed playing the spiderman ps games youll be familiar with the control scheme right away
film stars tobey maguire and willem dafoe supply the voices for spidey and the green goblin respectively with dafoe giving a great over the top vocal performance
the only major problems with the game are some of the levels get too repetitive and the camera angle doesnt help much in the heat of battle
the game itself is loaded with extras and secrets that will keep gamers playing and all in all if your a spiderman fan this game is a more than solid dealthis game has awesome awesome graphics good storyline a bit different than the movies good voiceoversall of that
buuuuuuuuutone problem
toooooooo short
i beat it on normal in  days
actully  and a half
this game is tons of fun while it lasts
still i guess you can play it on different challenge moads
and its fun just to replay the first few levels too
ok anywaythe game is different then the movie
it features green goblin duh shocker vulture and scorpion
as you move about the game youll run into golden spider icons
when you touch them youll attain a new combo
if you forget the combo buttons you can press quotstartquot and click quotcombat controlsquot
walah
the normal fighting controls are just like the  for ps so youll probably remember them
also you can unlock secrets such as bowling and hidden movies when you collect enough points
ok im gonethis was the first game i purchased for my ps long ago
looking back at it this was a well made game
spiderman animated amazingly and it had a lot of web swinging and action and tied somewhat well with the filmi played it again recently for nostalgia sake and i was glad it still holds upsorta
now compared to current spiderman games now lets be honest theres no way especially hardcore players
now for kids and young teens yes
its the linearity that makes the difference
for hardcore players they might dislike it as its level to level
but for younger players it well guided experiences  but it has the difficulty for both demographicsa well made spiderman game indeedeveryone got caught up in last years hype and bought this game
i did as well and realised it sucked
its a mediocre action title with much more to be desired
unless you must have it forget iti gave this game a rent a little while ago and was pleasantly surprised
those of you who played the first spider man game for the playstation will remember its stengths and weaknesses well
some levels the outdoor ones notably were a lot of fun and the oneliners spidey shot at villains were great
but later on the gameplay lost a lot of its excitement and the levels got frustrating
who wants to play through a hard section expecting to get to save and then find that they are only halfway through a levelspider man the movie for ps solves the problems that plagued the original nicely while enhancing the gameplay of the best levels of the original
the levels have nice variety from the outdoor webslinging its not realistic to web the sky itself but hey im not complaining to cool boss fights that mostly consist of simply dodging attacks and beating up the bad guy the way it should be
and low and behold every time you complete a hard section you get to save yes
i actually like the game better than the movie if you can believe that
the reason why is simple
its more exciting and its more like spider man
instead of character interaction you dont really care about you get nonstop action
it feels more like the cartoon show that came out a few years back
just when spidey thinks he can finally breathe theres something or someone else threatening to destroy something
cool
and of course my biggest problem with the movie was the abscence of the trademark spidey oneliners i actually had a friend who was an extra in the movie and told me about a great classic spider man oneliner that was cut from the movie
this game has got tons of them
and though they may repeat a bit too much theyre still greatlastly id like to say that for better or worse this game features voices straight from the movie
i really dont like tobey mcguire as spiderman all that much but everyone else does a super job
and the cinematics in the game are cool tooat the price this game is going for right now you might as well buy it
funny i forgot to mention it before this game is a lot of fun
i loved playing it
and isnt that what matters most in the endspiderman is a really awesome game with only one flaw in its design
the game is too short
you could beat it in  hours and after youve beaten it a few times it gets really boring and you dont want to play it anymore
but overall the game is great
the graphics are awesome and the movement space is really cool
the areial acrobatics are a very neat feature in the game and the fully interactive enviornment is just amazingoverall an excellent jobfiner point the game needs to be longerbottom line an awesome gamethis game is cool for awhile if you like to swing around the city and save people but the graphics are a little crappy and you do the same bull over and over again like save people and hear people scream spiderman help me over and over again
gets old fast but if your die hard spider dork you need to buy this but if your an average gamer like myself you might want to rent this for a couple daysall i can say is this game has alot of potential
the graphics arent bad but they wont win any awards
the gameplay when swinging through the cities is exciting but when spidey hits the indor levels he gets quotless manueverablequot
the camera angle can sometimes greatly affect the gameplay
sound is ok with tobey maguire voicing spiderman and william dafoe voicing the green goblin
even though they have the movie actors for the voices they sound like they arent even trying
the game closely follows the movie and it could use some more outdoor levels
as a matter of fact the entire game should be outdoors
the fact is i enjoyed spiderman while it lasted but it needs more umph
id say the next game if they fix the flaws in this onewill blow off the roofspiderman is a great movie engrossing the player into the shoes of spiderman himself
however on the downside the game has no link at all with the actual spiderman movie
for example finding uncle bens assasian in the game is a totally different ballgame than finding the assasain in the movie
the moves and the fighting is aweinspiring
the camera angles can agitate the player on most ocassions however this does not take away the ultimate charm of the gamethe replay value is what gives it the 
its not much but better than nothing
the game itself is very fun and definitely worth renting and if you really like it and like the little replay value of the game like spider man bowling playing as green goblin playing as shocker and playing as other people like mary jane a cop a thug etc
for a reference of other games is buffy the vampire slayer if you like that for xbox youll lovvvve spiderman
xbox version has bonus leveljust to let anyone reading this review know i do not own this game i went cheap and rented it
so the scale of stars is for renting not owningwith that out of the way i think spiderman is a good little game that looks very good on the xbox
i heard it has better graphics than the other systems and a bonus level with kraven the hunter
well this is all true the game looks very good and plays pretty well
the cut scenes are awesome and stay very true to the characters
plus the levels you play in switch it up enough so your not just constantly bashing things
there are actualy legit goals you have to accomplish and some are much harder than othersthere is also a neat training mode where bruce campbell of evil dead fame directs you on the different things you can do with spiderman
plus with his voicing you actually get all the actors voices from the movie coming out as well
these include tobey mcguire sorry probably butchered his last name spelling wise and william dafoeall in all this is a good little game that for the most part is challenging and has alot to offer mode wise when it comes to training and dinking around
the game play is good and easy to figure out although the camera angles screw you over once in a while
only downfall i see to the game is it is not very long and a bit easy to get through
but there are challenges and secret areas to find in each level minus the boss levels of course that do make it highly playable again
so go out and rent this one at least webheads
its worth itthis is is an okay game by activision it is spiderman based on the movie and it got morein the game you have to defend the city from the clutches of evil with all new combat moves and move through stunning scenes from the movie as you explore enormous city environments with newfound maneruverability and you can battle the toughest villans including shocker kraven the hunter vulture and the green goblinspiderman on the xbox got one more special level you wont find it in the other two systemsthis game is cool but short so you might rent it first if you like it then i guess buy itthis game is great except for this one problem
took me maximum  minutes to beat the gameps the goblin looks better in the game than he does in the moviei really like spider man
i like every thing about it but it is missing something
they said it is free roaming but it is not
i want to go every where in the whole city and do what ever i want with my super powers
it is too limited and it restricts me too much to where i can go
didnt they notice elder scrolls  morrowind and grand theft auto 
the game is great but it still feels rushed
it could have and should have been betterim surprised how many official and individual reviews are lukewarm to this game
ive had a blast playing it and i still am
i agree that it is a little too short but its not nearly as bad as most of the adventure console games ive played
the green goblin missions give the game a depth of replayability that most games never do
if you grow bored with the game you should try finding some of the cheats that are out there
some of them really add extra depthill agree that the camera mode can be a little frustrating sometimes
i think theyve done the best they can considering the complicated movements that spidey performs but some of the indoor levels can be whacky with the action gets tense
some reviewers and even the offical xbox magazine accused some of the levels of being boring
its true that some of the later quotcreeping aroundquot levels are a little tedious but i thought they were all interesting enough to keep me going
a little difficult maybe but not boringalthough theyre a little grainy a side effect of being a cross platform game im sure the graphics are still excellent
the attention to detail lighting and city scapes are absolutely incredible
the sound is good but nothing to write home about
i will say that the dolby digital sound really helped create a sense of paranoia when creeping around especially when the alarms go off
i also liked the the fact that tobey mcguire did the voice work instead of a stand inwhat i think makes the game most succesful and satisfying for me as a player is how the developers managed to fuse all the better aspects of the movie with the comics
since this game is based on the movie they had to make the addon villains a little more photorealistic so they didnt seem out of place or goofy
the story and cinematics are topnotch and balance between interactive movie and interactive comic
the makers got it all right in this category
the webslinging the mid air acrobatics the high speed action is exactly what id come to expect
unlike batman vengence the xboxs other recent multiplatform superhero game the novelty of being spiderman doesnt quite wear offive seen the ps and gamecube versions in action and theyre vastly inferior
the xbox version even has a bonus level featuring kraven the hunter
even if you decide not to buy this game its definitely worth a rent
i cant remember the last time i played an old fashioned adventure game and enjoyed it but i definitely enjoyed this onethis game is great
its the movie with the plyastation spiderman  and  games thrown it
its very easy to play and the game has a good default controller setup
some of the missions are boring and annoying especially when you have to chase the vulture but overall this game is greati only give it  stars because like the playstation games it gets a little boring especially when you keep messing upi do not own this game but i rented it and it was very fun
i do not advise you to buy it because it is fairly easy although there are multiple difficulty levels it gets boring to play the same levels over and over again
when i rented it and played it on easy i could beat most of the levels on my first or second try and i am not one of those people that beats most games in less than a week
this game has great graphics and good controls but it just gets old
my advice is to rent it and if you dont beat it right away maybe buy a used copy but i dont think its worth  bucksin this game spiderman comes in great fashion and few flaws
i might as well say the flaws first
they are  gameplay is very familiar
the first couple of levels are annoying and pointless
and  there is no multiplayer
other than that though it is super fun and recomended to spiderman fansgood game
has extra stuuff on xbox
its more fun to play as spoiler spoiler spoler green goblin though
his attacks are much better and he can flyunfortunately i was one of those idiots who bought gamecube over ps
i bought ssbm rogue leader thps spy hunter and cel damage
cel damage is awesome
it has a challenging array of levels and modes
with three modes that have  levels in each makes this game great
there are  unlockable characters along with the normal  characters
each character has their own unique weapons that can be unlocked so all characters may use them
as for normal weapons there are  of those
each level is interactive with vines and drop bridges along with many other thingsfun story  a tv show is a retarded ideaaction challenge graphics  its a cartoon
what can i sayi have palyed the xbox version and its a blast
all the characters and tracks are way cool
the graphics suck cartoony graphics plain simple
and its very easy but long
buy this game if you are a racing games fanim writing this review a little differently
im writing it in comparison to the live franchise
as im sure youre already aware there is no season or dynasty gameplay option in mm   while this greatly detracts from the single player experience the games gameplay itself is greatly improved over the live series
lets start with the rebounding
on live  and  you more often than not chase down loose balls as rebounds
rarely will you see a player actually jump and catch a ball off the rim
this is not the case in mm   if youre on offense youd better put up a decent shot because there arent many offensive rebounds
no more putting up  after  because the defense cant get a board
no more throwing passes into a clogged lane
if you do this itll likely get stolen
the momentum meter while usually limited to the college game adds a measure of realism to the games
i mean lets face itwhen a team is on a roll they shoot better as a team
in live this isnt the case
now you people can cry about the dynasty and season modes being omitted but if youd have done  minutes worth of research youd have saved  bucks so quite your crying
a great improvement in gameplay than eas previous attempts
a step in the right direction even though its but a stepi bought this game this weekend along with a game boy advancedbut my mom still says i cant play it till im on the planebut i play it anyhowso far the game has nice graphicsyou have a different chose of playable charactersonly mario and lugiebut you can pretty much play either of them in any gameand a good storylinebut i think the only thing annoning wright now is the fact that whenever lugie jumps its hard to control himthats probably only my problemand whenever you go to another level and you stop what ever character you are the other one has a bubble over it saying quotrquotof course its just to swicth the people around so the other can playbut it drives me crazyits an ok game and allbut i think i like the mario games that came out for the game boy were betteri was lucky enough to be around when super mario world first came out
the game made a huge impact upon its release and it changed the way platformers were made
super mario bros  was already a big change from the original but thisthis was an even bigger change
better graphics bigger levels alternate exits secret worlds yoshi and a pretty extravagant ending at the time
up until i had to sell my snes just a few years ago the game would get regular play because its that good
but this review is for the gba version
i got this for my daughter who even at her early age is doing really good with games
thought itd be a good stepping stone to introduce her to the traditional mario formula because of how accessible it is to people of all ages and since it can be played on the ds too
well it looks like going from the snes to the gba was a big change in its own rightbasic story that you should all know by now bowser kidnaps princess toadstool
mario goes to save her
jumps around and runs through tons of different levels
the end
but along the way youll have to take out bowsers kids clear out some ghost houses and if you want find the secret star road levels and then the secret levels within those too
the game takes a while to beat though hardcore players can probably clear the whole thing in one sitting
the game has a good save feature and for this gba version you can now save and continuequit whenever you want
gameplay is very easy since youre really only using  buttons and the dpad and really anyone can play this game
when you find an egg yoshi will emerge and you can ride him and take an extra hit eat enemies fly if you eat a blue koopa shell and use him as a boost if you cant reach a high area on your own
and he finally has green arms instead of orange ones now too
marios got some tricks of his own as well including the fire flower and magic feather
with the fire flower he can shoot fireballs and shoot them in both directions during a spin jump
with the feather mario dons a cape and can fly after running a short distance and even glide around if you hold down and then hit up real quick
if you thought flying as a raccoon or tanuki was cool wait until you see the capethey changed a few things for the gba port most of which are little things
like now you can switch between mario and luigi on the map
its kind of annoying since you can choose this whenever you stop at an area on the map as if the games reminding you of the feature instead of selecting who you want to play as at the beginning of the game but its still a nice addition
luigis sprite changed to his sprite from super mario bros  on the mario allstars collection and he has the same extended jump from that game too
truth be told its a bit more difficult to play as him now because of this
the other changes arent that big of a deal but the main one is the one a lot of people are either overlooking or somehow not bothered by it
since this was made for the gba before the ds came out it plays with just the a b l and r buttons
a is the default runaction button and b is your regular jump but the spin jump something required for a lot of things in the game is now the freakin r button a shoulder button
even after playing this version for a few days i cant get used to it
it feels weird but its not like they had a lot of options for controls at the time
oh they also put in the obligatory mario bros arcade game you know the old mario vs luigi game where you just collect coins and take out koopas by hitting the floor from under them
its been included on every single super mario advance title and is fun for a few minutes but at this rate its overkillthe graphics and music suffered a bit in the conversion to gba
everything looks a bit watered down and less vibrant and some animations dont seem as smooth as they once were
most of the sound effects are the same as the original as is the music but because of the hardware it doesnt sound as good as it once did
no big deal for people who never got to play it in the early s but for people who grew up with the game youll noticesuper mario world for gba is worth your money if you like platformers or want to see how good mario was back in the day before everything got dumbed down since now most games hold your hand for the first  hours and show you how to do the most basic of things
but the uncomfortable controls hurt the score for me as does hearing the stupid mario and luigi voices that were added in
just little complaints of mine that have nothing to do with the overall game but for people expecting a perfect port this aint it
maybe well get lucky and an updated mario allstars will come out for ds at some pointthis is a great game
the graphics could be a little better but other than that the game will keep your attention
the game is farley easy to beat if you go from level  to  but if you are a hardcore gamer like me there are so many secret areas in this game
to get all of them with the yoshi coins in each level is tough
i give the game  stars instead of  because when you are throught with the game there is nothing else to do
there is a multiplayer game like in super mario  advance but that is it
i recomend renting it before you buy itone of nintendos big money makers is porting their old games over to new systems
specifically the super mario advance games have been a huge hit
super mario advance  brings over two games to the game boy advance
the first mario brothers is so simple that its basically a minigame
the real draw here is super mario world one of the most popular mario games ever  and for good reasonsuper mario world is not exactly ground breaking
it uses the same formula and plot from super mario brothers and super mario brothers  however it is an immense adventure which lots of hidden levels and plenty to explore even after youve defeated bowser
it also introduces some new moves to the mario brothers such as a spinning jump that can break bricks from above
moreover it introduces one of the more enduring characters of the mario franchise yoshi
the one thing i think its really missing is the variety of suits and powers that came with super mario brothers  super mario world only has three powerups the super mushroom the fire flower and the cape which allows limited flight and works similar to the raccoon leaf of the previous gameif youve played a mario game before it all seems very familiar but is also a ton of fun
the mario franchise is one of those special games that doesnt need to break a lot of new ground  it just needs to keep doing what its been doing
for those new to the franchise super mario world is a good introduction
while mario has worked well in d games his roots are with the d sidescroller and super mario world helps demonstrate why those games are still fun even todayi had this game when i was in th grade im in th now
it got stolen but the point is that it was very fun so much fun i didnt ever want to stop
i mean i took it to school and played it in class never got caughtheh heh
thats how unfortunately it got stoleni like how this game was
in fact it was a lot better than super mario  because of newer enemies the introduction of yoshi new levels and secret courses you can unlock
if i had this game still today heh i wouldnt even be writing this review right now
by the way i gave it  stars because it got hard at times but allinall a great super mario classicanother mario masterpiece is with us
this game is amazing and doesnt let you down
with about  levels and hidden areas this game will take you a long while to complete
graphics are amazing and the fun factor is an outstanding 
amazing game for anyone
it is fun for anyone and is a must buy for any gba ownermay i ask what was wrong with the original snes version
i mean okay
they may or may not be able to completely accurately reproduce the exact graphics and sound of the original snes on a gba screen and i dont mind including a very basic mario brothers game the way they did but im a little upset that like lttp they added a lot of repetitive and dumbsounding voiceovers
i mean i usually like voices in video games but only when i dont have to hear the same line over and overadditionally the graphics colors were definitely not as sharp as i feel they should have been
certainly not up to the snes levelone of these days nintendo should come out with something called classic snes series in the vein of their current classic nes series of games which will faithfully reproduce the original games without butchering them or decorating them like christmas treesbut i digressthe text means the same thing but is worded differently the presence of luigi running back and forth gets very annoying andi think thats itthe games story is really the same and as far as i can tell the level structure is exactly identicle
this is why i gave it as high a grade as i did
if they had tried to mess around with the gameplay like they did in the rehash of donkey kong country i would have rated this game much worsebut they didnt so i didnt
its not perfect or faithful or respectful to what has come before but it is at least similar enough to feel somewhat like the oldits fun in the begining but the levels get harder and game play is not as fun it got so hard it was not much fun to playand has not much varity in itit just sometimes surprises me exactly what video games seem to be all about and thensome
especially when you dont have the system for it at first but get it at a later date
well anyway that has started to become a constant for nintendo
they have started to reissue some of their most classic games onto the gamecube and game boy advance
still that does make it into a whole new game
the mario brothers legacy has remained that constant
the brothers celebrated their th anniversary last year since the first mario brothers game  and a whole lot of players in regions from all over the world
yet although their story remains easy now it always comes back as a fanbased groove for many people all over the worldsuper mario advance  super mario world is a real surprise as one of the first super nintendo games put upon the game boy shelves
what makes this game work so well as a new introduction to the game boy advance
the game was a big smash before and yet nothing else has changed to the advance but the gameplay
the game features  different worlds and the debut of yoshi
in this game bowser is at his old tricks again and you and luigi and yoshi have to encounter all different kinds of outrageous feats and courses which really test your strength and skill
although it is nothing new if youve played it and beat it for the super nintendo system you only get it again because you havent played it for so long and need the groove again
the graphics are beautiful and just keep showing promise in its prime and the enemies also keep getting harsher including renzor the koopa kids which made their debut in super mario  and a whole lot more than meets the eye
it gets exciting with time passing but also a feel of the plumber has sat true hereall in all the game remains as a classic for nintendo buffs and is a must have all over again
if you havent played this before you dont know what youre missing
this is a must have for the game boy advance game boy player for the gamecube and the game boy advance spi own this game for the snes and i love it
it is funny and it never gets boring the mario series have the best replayability alongside rpgs
it ranks up there alongside smb  as one of the greatest mario games of all time
u go through  different worlds and defeat the  koopas bosses
ur goal is pretty much the same as in all the other mario games cept smb 
ur goal is to defeat bowser and rescue princess peach
also u can beat the star world and the secret special world accessible only once u beat the star world and soemthing kool will happen
i give this game five stars and aboveserious sam is far superior
it plays well on any decent machine it is correctly priced and the graphics are outstanding
it is amazing how the game engine allows you to walk into the background scenery like near the end where you have to walk towards a cathedral in the distance
it is barely visible when you start the level but you do walk right up to it
the detailed textures in the levels buildings are amazingand of course there are gobs of monsters to shoot down i love using the new sniper rifle and flamethrower weaponsi have played some more expensive games that were nowhere near as good as serious sam
i cant wait for the conclusion and that is my only gripe the single player game was too shortssse is the perfect sequel to serious sam
its more of the same great gameplay with new settings and great new levels
i enjoyed it every bit as much altough its my opinion that the ending was not as goodevery bit as good as the first and its an inexpensive title too so get iti was just looking for a shootemup game and this one was good
but like many of the games you have to shoot the opponent a zillion times to make sure theyre dead the graphics are fantastic the opponent aliens are weirdbut cooloverall i figure if i feel i got my moneys worth its a good game
this one is worth the moneyserious sam the second encounter ssse is a very good game but its got one trait i had trouble with  its not seriousoh but the graphics are great
croteam really deserves credit for a job well done
sunlight rain and special effects are rendered very nicely in this game and amazingly it ran smoothly even on my pentium iii systemthe weapons are good too
ssse brings back all the weapons from serious sam but also includes a great flame thrower that can set a tree on firebut as i mentioned this game isnt serious and i found that annoying
shooters and lame jokes just dont mix
when i travel to an alien planet to battle hordes of scarey monsters i want to have white knuckles and a feeling of awe
the humor in ssse just seems misplaced
i guess its like laughing at a funeraldont let that stop you from buying this game however
its well worth the price and itll hold its own with any shooter out thereserious sam  picks up where serious sam left off
the game essentially has the same engine with some improvements
it also contains new weapons enemies and of course brand new levels
serious sam  is even more fun than the original and multiplayer cooperative matches are simply a blastive played alot of video games but i can say straight off that this has been one of the best i have ever playedwhy do i say thatwell the great graphicssoundgameplayintense immersion and challenge asidethis is one of the few games i own that i keep coming back to play againand againboth of the incarnations of serious sam amp are on the same high quality scale of the first person shooter genre and rate very high marks indeedcroteam the creators of the serious sam phenom were to release a third and final game to end the series but to date this unfortunately has not come to passbut ill continue to keep my fingers crossed and on the trigger ready and waiting for that day when mental and his minions challenge us once again to a battle to the deatha game no true gamer should be without in his collectionserious sam the second encounter has no story just oldskool gameplay
the graphics are nothing special pretty neat effects but nothing that raises the bar past unreal or quake
the sound system is pretty unique and realistic and the music eyecandy is cool
the gameplay is fun and tough literally hundereds of freaky and hard big enemies and you using big guns and armor at the same time in huge interesting levels with great arcitecture
at maxed settings at high resolutions the game performs pretty disapointing on low and medend system setups but on hiend system setups the game performs decentthe game is seriously meant for multiplayer
poly counts are kind of low
its a  great game overall but not the bestthe game is simple engaging and fun
but i cannot get it to work with my logitech wireless controllerbeing a fan of music games especially the nowinfamous dance dance revolution i jump at the chance of a completely unique game featuring technostyle music
i also have loved segas entries into the video game hall of fame even though most of the titles are harshly underappreciated
this title combines the two pseudogenres  an underappreciated sega unique music titlefirst off i think this game is the best argument that game creation is a form of digital art
this game flows and gleams with an artistic style most games lack
from the tronlike visuals to the extremely catchy beats the game keeps you riveted and openjawed through the entire playthroughthe graphics technically are a bit dated but that is mainly because it is a port of a dreamcast version that was never brought overseas to the american version
it is a bit bland singled out but when combined with the music ad the fluid controls and thumping of te controller to the beat it all seems to fit perfectlythis game is hard to explain in the gameplay area
by technicality it is a shooter but that in no way gives it justice
the controls are very close to panzer dragoons style of moving a cursor around the screen and as you slide over targets they are selected and then fired upon
but the cool thing is that the blasts and explosions all become part of the music making it sound different every time you play
this really makes the game more of an experience then a pure gameand that leads to the negative
the game is very short
in about  hours you can master the game so all the play modes you open start becoming extremely easy although there are many to extend replayability
the main draw of this game is that it is very addictive and will still be very fun to pull out months from now and experience againoverall this is one of my favorites from the past few months and has been the perfect game for breaks from final fantasy x  pick this game up if you enjoy unique games and good technoits supposed to be an excellent rail shooter and looks amazing
i really want a copyok this game is pretty much the dreamcast version with better graphics more multi player stuff and choa virtual pet things thats more than enough to make me buy the game
 ive played the game for dreamcast and it is pretty neat but some of the emerald search levels end up with your controller meeting the wall
if this was a review for sa on dc then i would have given it  stars but gamecube rocks and should improve the game immensleyoh god renting it wasnt good enough i had to buy it
its sonics best game in my opinion
this game is great for  players
you can even take care of your chao alittle creature type thing in which you can raise
this game is a must play or buy if you played itthe next sequel after sonic adventruethis is the same gameplay as sonic adventure  on the dreamcastmuch better graphics more character more gameplay and  player d remmbr sonic adventure and sonic battle are both the same is just sonic battle is when the character fight and sonic adventure is sonics adventuresonic adventure  is unlike anything ive ever played
get it for the exploration or get it for the rush of sonic and shadows unimaginable speed
either way get itcity escape is the first level you play in hero side of the game as sonic
this level alone makes the entire game worthwhile
i noticed today that ive played that level over  times while ive played most tailsrobotnick knucklesrouge levels  time
its just the core definition of fun
unfortunately not all levels are like that
with knucklesrouge youre thrown into worlds where you must find  pieces of the chaos emerald
its tedious many times the rush from the sonicshadow levels is no where to be seen in these levels
theyre fun if only mildlybut then youve got tailsrobotnick
these levels are straightforward shoot everything
theres some fun elements to that but its a little repetetivewait wait wait
with all this negative talk why on earth did i give it  out of  stars and not something lower
because theres so much replay value to this game it never gets old
get all  emblems which i have yet to do and something very very cool will happen that will make oldschool sonic fans much like myself very very happy
and not to mention chaos like tamogatchis cmon who doesnt know what those are
raising chao seemed like such a difficult task at first however my friend showed me how to get started and its quite easy and addicting
thats a game in itselfso sonic adventure  battle  lots of time if you dont have time get this anyway
its great just watch out for those emerald piecesthere are occasions when a fanboy has to fall on the floor laughing
ps fanboys celebrated when final fantasy went to playstation and now nintendophils have something to celebrate
sega was the first to accuse nintendo of catering to children and sonic was the mascot bad boy that they were using to target the teens
back then nobody bought the nintendo only for kids garbage the way they do now excpet people who actually own a nintendo system and know better
we forgive the ignorant media though
sonic was used to wage a war against mario a war that sonic eventually lost
nintendo and sega were once very bitter rivals both offering a decent system the snes being the better of the two but some genisis games were still great
but eventually sega spent too much time on developing new machines and selling them at prices noone could afford and thier reputation went downhill
playstation slaughtered the saturn and sega all but vanished until the beauty that was the dreamcast
the dc was a great machine with some amazing games and could have revived sega if it werent for some poor advertising and marketingconsidering the biter rivalry between mario and sonic the hedghog landing in the gcn is perhaps the most ironic event since the nintendosquare break up
not only that but that sega is offering nintendo quite a line up from here on out as wellthe game itself is far from graphically impressive as it is only slightly enhanced from the dreamcast version however this game is so much fun that everyone should buy it
the problem i have with it is that i have never been good at sonic games and playing as the sonic team i cant even clear the first stage
playing as dr eggmans formerly dr robutnick i dont know why they changed the name team i got much further
i do have a complaint about rouges fetch quests though
each time you die and you will the item placement changes which can make the levels frusterating at times
there is one part where you have a five minute time limit to fetch a series of choas emeralds a feat which i wonder if it is even acievable because there is no time to check the hints screens that are afloat and the radar doesnt really held to determine which of the four floors the emeralds are
the stages that are the most fun are hands down sonics and shadows as both are lightning quick and the camera has been tweaked for much better performance than the dc version
there is no slowdown no framerate drops and aside from a couple of parts being too difficult for me but mind you i suck at sonic games this game is great
dont hesitate to buy itsonic games are now and have always been great and im glad to have them on the cube
i just wish the sonic team would resolve the same old camera issues
at times the camera angle is horrible
but the game is still a ton of fun definately on my list of games every cube owner should getin this game you can play as good or evil
in good mode you switch being sonic tails and knuckles
when your sonic you battle evil robots and race to the finishwhen tails you walk in a machine beat bad guys and get to the finish in one piece
when knuckles you try to find three pieces of the master emerald
to get the pieces of the master emerald you have to dig bounce look find and much more
in chao land chaos are cute little animals you can pet chaos raise them feed them race them have adventures with them go to chao kindergarten do chao karate and more
theres even more fun when in evil mode when you are shadow robotnik and rougewell i being an owner of a sega genesis have played many of the classic sonic games
so when this came out for the cube i thought i should expand my sonic collection
i a glad i did
the game features two main modes hero and dark
both vary in different ways but share a common goal to collect all the chaos emeralds
in dark you play as shadow dreggman and rouge
in hero you play as sonic tails and knuckles
after you beat both sides you unlock a new mode
in this mode all six characters come togehter to prevent the space statio n from running into earth
the game itself contains over  missions
exclusive to the gamecube version is a series of multiplayer games
in these games you can be such people as chaos zero metal sonic or amy
the reason this game got  stars is because the game lacks replay value and the multiplayer games are a little lacking
overallid say the game is worth a buywhile this gamecube installment is popular in its own right i think its more appropriate to begin with this games true source
sega dreamcast  the th birthday of the little blue hero sonic
sega needed an accompanying game that would cap off a decade for their flagship mascot
sonic adventure  while not flawless was still a title that left other games in the dust that same yearwhereas nintendo ead focuses their game development on depth and imagination sonic teams main focus on games is getting into the heart of the action
that comes into full circle with this title
sonic adventure  is chock full of bursting energy a game thats a pyrotechnical display of volleyinducing frenzy
the level design put into the courses is excellent and showcases sonic teams actionoriented ingenuity at its best
go play dynamic levels such as quotgreen forestquot quotradical highwayquot quotcrazy gadgetquot and quotfinal rushquot
never before has sonic team combined exertion and structure so well in a sonic game
the graphics are mesmerizing even at breakneck speed
bright sharp and ready to pounce your eyeballs
a technical improvement over the first sonic adventure and one of the great final showcases for the dreamcasts visual powerthe music of the sonic adventure series is very overlooked
platform game music continues its redundancy while sega energizes it
jun senoue and other members of the wavemaster team created a new image for the sonic franchise with a bright sound that has inventive pop hooks and melodic rockrooted riffery
they transcend all styles appropriately as well from jazz to hiphop to big band
its like a big music carnival
the two sonic adventure soundtracks show the platform world that music is still a vibe among the genresonic adventure  still has standout flaws so the fun factor gets  stars
there were no big leaps in improving the camera at all from the first sonic adventure and the story mode is lacking compared to its predecessor
as for this gamecube installment the star rating is even more appropriate
while there are extras the quotbattlequot feature seems unnecessary and is more of a tackon to quotupdatequot the game and its name
and most of all this classic dreamcast sonic game just does not feel right on a nintendo system
while the gc version is not bad by any stretch be a part of history and try to get the original game for dreamcast if possiblesonic adventure  in its true purest form is a videogame for gamers
you can go about your corporate ps and xbox or your online escapades on your beefedup pc
however nothing really beats the heart of a classic series pinnacle whose only sole purpose was for you to have a blastthe game is pretty fun and usually hard to find
this is the way sonic shouldve been made oneonone fightsits a good game but hard at times and u find ur self doin the same thing  times but its worth buyingthis game is a pretty well rounded game
if you want to play multiplayer thoughthis is not the game for you
the multiplayer levels and characters lack
you can only be one of the  characters in race mode
the producers must have rushed this game into stock
the best part about the game is the chaosand they are a little hard to explain since i can only write  words in this reviewlolthis game is fast
and then its slow
and then its blazing
i like it a lot but the new features arent quite all theyre cracked up to beas an oldschool sonic the hedgehog fan i had all of them on the genesis i was very happy to see sab released on the nintendo gamecube
i was a little concerned though as sonic on nintendo hardware was predicted as a sign of the apocalypse by nostradamus
but the world hasnt ended yet so i think well be alrightthe gameplay is somewhat mixed
this is because there are three different kinds of levels quotsonicquot levels where you race through various d worlds trying to get to the end as fast as possible quottailsquot levels where you run around in a mechasuit blasting enemies and trying to get as many points as possible and quotknucklesquot levels where you have to run climb and fly around d levels searching for randomly hidden chaos emerald fragments as quickly as possible
i found the quotsonicquot levels to be the most fun  the quottailsquot levels tended to drag at points and the quotknucklesquot levels vary in difficulty drastically depending on where the emeralds are hidden each time
you have a sort of quothotcoldquot detector to help find them but something that at least gave some hint of a direction to go in would have made these levels much less painful
as you progress through the game you can also unlock extra abilities for each character which will let them go back to the earlier levels and find hidden items and areas that you couldnt reach beforethere are actually two plots a quotheroquot plot where you play as sonic tails and knuckles and a quotdarkquot plot where you play as shadow an evil hedgehog eggman dr robotniks grandson who has a mech like tails and rouge a bat with abilities much like knuckles
after you beat both games theres a final set of levels where both teams have to work together to save the world culminating in a final boss battle featuring well i wont spoil itthe quotchaoquot feature allows you to raise cute little tamagotchilike creatures between levels
by feeding them various powerup items you collect by destroying enemies and which are also hidden around the levels see above you can make them grow into various forms
i didnt find this particularly compelling but you can do all sorts of things with them including entering the critters you raise into a series of races and competitions and breeding multiple generations of them in the hopes of uh getting an even better little virtual fuzzball i guess
this also interacts with the sonic games on the gba but as i dont have a gba i cant comment on thatthe multiplayer i found to be not very fun at all
you can play several of the games levels against each other and you can also play a kart racing minigame
if you have friends who are big fans of the game you might get further than i didbasically sab is a fun colorful fastpaced game thats not too difficult and probably great for kids  the plot is pretty simple and the dialogue couldnt be any cheesier
but its still a blasti love sonic and this game wasnt a bad one but it wasnt as good as i thought it would be
i played it and beat it on the dreamcast but i found that near impossible on the cube most likely due to my familiarity to the controls for the dreamcast
i found it was difficult to change over to the cube controls after playing the dreamcast version
im not saying this was a bad game no far from that
its still an incredible game with excellent graphics and game play
im just warning players who have played it on the other systemlook it looks like just another game but tis is great
you get to choose betwen good or bad side an in each thers about  missions
also u get to figh enormous bosses from land to air to sea in temples and in space
thers also multiplayer which is really fun
and theres so many multiplayer features
thers about  characters
only bad thing the graphicslets see what i think of the supposed best sonic game evar
shall we
as a whole i like it the sonic and shadow stages are fun the ranking system is intriguing if a source of insanity for someone like me who needs to get the arank for every stage and the eggman and knuckles stages are fun as well
now the rouge and tails stages however simply stink
the level design for both of these is infuriating and the control of the tails mech will drive you up the wall
all in all is this the best sonic game of all time
no that would be colors but its an experience you shouldnt pass upthis game does have a rather addicting appeal to it but it wears off after you beat it
first off the adventure fields from the first game are gone
these were a huge takedown from the game because you could talk to people go to courses and chao gardens without using an annoying map and that you could find sonic emblems by simply going to a hard to find space and collecting it
it also added to the plot
you can arrive at one place and find an enemy there leading into a boss battle instead of just being taken there after beating a level
second the graphics are good at some points but are horrible at other points
third in some points of some courses you just have to hold forward on the control stick and the character does everything for you
this is the bad side of the loopdeloops and corkscrews a lack of challenge
also some of the characters tails might make you extremeley annoyed because of their stupid and corny lines
there are some good points to the game though
multiplayer can be unfair at times but just barely
it is a fun aspect of sonic games
chaos are also a great aspect of the game
as a virtual pet a chao can like or dislike a character according to the way that character treats it
there are also races and karate for the chao its skills raising with the animals it recieves
when sonic adventure dx directers cut comes out buy that it has everything that was taken away in this game i am reviewing and more
overall if you have no history with any of the sonic games than rent this game before you buy itin this fastpaced not to hard game you either play team hero story sonic tails knuckles or team dark story shadow eggman rouge
the sonicshadow levels are pure bliss racing around at the speed of sound destroyed easy to beat robots
the only hard levels are probably the ones with rails because its so easy to jump and miss the tiny rails and fall into oblivion
tailseggman levels are ok mostly they include blowing up things with bazookas and machine guns if you like that kind of thingknucklesrouge levels are totally evil
they include little robots three emeralds in hard to reach places and a big stage
if you like digging and searching through levels this is for you
i didnt find the game that hard and my favorite part is the chao
chao are cute little alienthings
that you feed take care of and train to win races and karate
it can get boring after awhile though main plot of game herosave the world from dreggman and shadow while trying to clear sonics name
darktake over world and kill off sonic and co  all together easier on gc than dreamcast but the dreamcast game is still better in many waysim a true sonic the hedgehog fan whos been there since the beginning and even though i have not played this game i can tell you anything sonic is worth itgiven how polished sonic adventure  battle is it surprises me that sega didnt put more work into the gamecube release of the original sonic adventure
sonic  sports fast furious levels with sonic and shadow with plenty of secrets and alternate pathssonic and shadow steal the show but you can also play as tails and eggman both in big robots or as rouge and knuckles who have treasurefinding missions
the tails and eggman missions offer some amusement although are nowhere near as fun as the sonic and shadow levels
the rouge and knuckles levels however are extraneous and tediousstill great fun for everybody in the familyin my  years of playing video games i have played many sonic games
while i would like to call this one the best i just cant
for one thing the knuckles and rouge levels give me a migraine the shooting levels with eggman and tails leave something to be desired and what exactly is the point of raising chao
couldnt sega add the option of whether or not u want to
while were on the subject of sega its still hard to grasp a sonic game on the gamecube
i guess thats because sega and nintendo were once competing against each otherthe sonic and shadow levels obviously are tight because theyre so fast paced but this game is lacking
however this game offers what few other games do the chance to play as heroes or the bad guysif youre a diehard sonic fan then go ahead and buy it
if youre not sure rent it firstalthough the game can get quite repetative some times i find it facinating
the greatest thing about the game is the chao ok so they dont do too much and their games are downright boring what you sit there and watch every great once in a while press the a button developing them ans seeing the differet variations you can come up with is quite cool
i especially like putting the skull on a chao the little quotrarquot noise they make is hilarioussolid gameplay and great graphics make this game good as well although like i said it can get quite repetative but that is why there are the  player battles the cart races and the chao it gives you something to do when you get sick of running in circlesstate of emergency is a game that you should buy for one main reasonyou will eventualy get tired of itbut somewhere down the road you will want to pop it in the ps for some blowoffsteammassive destruction funhaving said thati will go into further depth with this reviewsoe was made by rockstarthe same company that created the notoriously beautiful grand theft auto its been said a millon times before in other numerous reviews that soe is nothing like gtaim going to acknowledge that and say that its very true
dont play soe and expect it to be like gtaits notbut its still alot of funthis game for the most part is about destroying buildings blowing up people and creating pure chaos in a riot
sound fun huhevil grinthere is a revolution modewhere you attempt to solve the problems of the oppresive forces with indvidual missonsincluding escorting certain peoplefinding itemsand even a few assasinationsthis part of the game gets really frustrating really fast esp on the escorting missionsthe people you escort do not defend themselves at alland when you have a small army hunting you downits tough to stick up for a guy with low defense all the timeanother bad thing about revolution modeis that there arent alot of good weapons that randomly generate including guns
and when you have  guys with gunsflame throwers and even rocket launchersa can of mace or a club just aint gonna cut itbuy this game to play in chaos modethats where the true beauty of this game liesone serious downfall with this game is that mostly everything islockedmeaning that all the stages but the firstand all the playable characters but two are unable to be played unless you achieve high scores or pass certain levels in revolution mode
really bad idea especially if you start the game up for the first time wanting to play as the bigfat exgang member
this can all be solved of course by getting cheat codes off the internet
dont you just love cheats
some people complain that there is not a  player modewhich is kinda badbeing the fact that no one really helps you out in the gamesome gang members will help you beat up oppressive forcesbut alot of the times while you are trying to pummel on the same targetyou accidentally punch the guy whos helping youa gang member wonttake kindly to that
i think however if a  player mode was enabledthere would be a split screen on the tvone showing where the first player isand the other showing where the second ismani hate thatso its really no big deal that theres not a two player mode to meyou might feel diffrentlycontrols are really easy to get familiar with and you will be amazed at how fast the hours fly by when you play in chaos modethe music is just typical fightergame background musicnothingspectacularbut its not bad eitherall and allbuy this game soyou can play it whenever you want to relieve stress and blow upshootbeatignite and completely obliterate some virtual peoplelook up the cheat codes to solve the lack of variety with playable charactersonce you enter the cheat codes and save to a memory cardthose locked players will always be available for you to play withi really liked this game fun and awesome interaction with tons of people at once
it take a lot of balls to realease a game like this
but i really like it
no its not gta but its as original as it getsdeffiently worth buyingyou will never have so much fun ticking off your parents as when playing this gamechaos mode is soes cream of the crop  no definite goals or objectives you just run around blowing up cars and throwing grenades into buildings
throwing a molotov cocktail into a building and watching it explode while people scream and run in all directions is definitely alot of fun
chaos mode sometimes gives you little goals like a short time period where breaking windows is worth double points or a time limit on blowing up all the cop cars in the level but mostly you are free to do what you want
the weapons are awesome fun to use and each has its place and function
rocket and grenade launchers are good for some vehicular destruction and when the cops come after you there is a good assortment of machine guns shotguns flame throwers and even pepper spray
these shootouts with the law are great  cops and soldiers swarm you and you must retreat to a safe distance and then mow em all down and usually a few civilians too cause they cant help but get in the way
this inforces a style of play in which you run frantically from corner to corner causing as much destruction as you can with whatever you can get your hands on
each area has local gangs too and if you attack them accidentally or on purpose you will envoke their wrath and theyll be after you
chaos mode also has a last clone standing varient in which the only people out are bad guys and you must empty the streets of them
this is fun as the bodies so start to pile upand yet all this fun is about as deep as an arcade game
at its heart state of emergency is a simple beatemup kinda like the old double dragon except taken to a grand scale
the crowds are neat and give a real sense of a riot going on but there is very little you can actually do with those people
the camera is very difficult to work especially since enemies tend to collect in your blind spots
the story mode revolution is pretty boring with endless missions that never seem to end
lastly the game only has  levels and of these i only liked  of the levels
not much there
these levels arent anything like the cities in gta  there is no breathing city theme  not much is going on and after a while youll feel like youve been there done thatmaybe rent this game first see what you thinkthe graphics are not the greatest but this game is fun running around killing people and there is millions of different weaponsi think that rockstar is the best and most honest game publisher out there
im sorry but if youve had a long day and are angry at everyone than playing a game like grand theft auto iii vice city and san andreas manhunt or state of emergency will ease your pain
state of emergency can have something like  people at the max on screen at one time which helps create the extreme sence of dread caused by the intense riots taking place
of course this many people on screen at once mean alot of carnage in chaos mode
sure you can kill thousands of people but theres usually a civillian casualty penalty which drains points making it more challenging
the revolution missions are pretty challenging they really push you to your limit
close minded adults think its right to outlaw these types of games and take away the free enterprise that rockstar deserves and has earned
another thing people often think that if you kill someone in a rockstar game like gta or state of emergency that youll be praised and glorified wrong
the gta atmosphere is realistic
if you ruthlessly kill someone in public you will be punished by law enforecment foreces
likewise in state of emergency if you do decide to gun down thousands of people than special enforcment swat type soldiers will come afteryou surround you and beat the living  out of you
enjoyat first i was hesitant to buy this game without ever playing it
the first half hour of playing it i wondered why i had spent my money on it
as with most games though it took awhile to get into it
after completing the few early missions the storyline got better and you realize what every mission is gearing towards
the only problem with this game is that there are many many missions to complete each level which there are  levels
other than that the game is flawless
interesting story fun missions challenging great weapons etc
overall this game lives up to its expectations
there has been a lot of confusion about the release date of this game
i called a best buy right next to my house and they said it wasnt even released yet
i called a best buy across town and they had about  of them
this game came out on tuesday feb this game is so much fun to play
it is alot like a d version of sreets of rage
there are so many weapons to use
the two bad things about this game
bad graphics and repetive missons bloody as hecka d version of streets of ragechaos modealot of weaponsintresting charchtersrepetiverevoultion modelevels arent that bigbad graphicsstate of emergency comes from rockstar makers of gta and vice city
its no surprise that the game involves a lot of violence bloodshed and mayhemthe world youre in is run by a corporation which is harsh and controlling
you are a male or female vigilante and you have four maps on which you can work a suburban mall chinatown a suburb and a corporate buildingeach map is fullroam  you can go whereever you want in it
each map is rather large too complete with cars glass windows to shatter trashcans to pick up and up to  running civilians each with his or her own personality
while the graphics arent glisteningly crisp like in kingdom hearts or ffx theyre still rather good
you can read the store signs in chinatown and see the flower design on your characters hawaiian shirtthere are different modes of game play all single player only
you can just roam around in a map killing the bad security guards and gaining points from shortterm goals such as blow up all enforcer cars
you can do a timed mode where you have to work through a series of objectives gaining time bonusses as you go to keep time on your clock
finally you can take on the almost mission main sequence where you are given specific tasks to do in order and report back at the end of each oneon one hand you can say that the game is very repetitive
while each level has different graphics the tasks in each one are the same  avoid hurting civilians kill the target enemy gather up health
the splashes of red blood are continuous although you can turn gore offbut on the other hand its an arcade game not requiring much thought
its mindless fun giving quick results and easy progress
there are selections of weapons from billy clubs to swords to flamethrowers and miniguns
after a hard day there is great satisfaction in the smash of a plate glass windownot for the young with its constant attack mentality in city streets
but for anyone old enough for vice city and halflife this is a fun casual way to blast through a few hours of funof course when you hear that a new game is coming out by the guys who brought you grand theft auto  lots and lots of unwanted and unwelcome hype is going to come out of the smoke and will ruin the game for everyone
this game was so overhyped that it led to people disliking the game
listen loud and clear this is not grand theft auto 
this game has a name of its own and is supposed to be different from gta 
if you want gta  then buy the game for crying out loud and stop complaining that this is not like gta 
i played this game with an open mind and i played it more than once before deciding my verdict on it
i feel that a lot of people played it for three minutes and decided eh it stinks
its a shame because i feel that this is a very good game and goes to very creative levels much like previous rockstar gamesthere are different modes you get to play and different missions for you to do
the whole game is basically rioting and looting in order to take down the corporation
you get to pick up objects and throw them through store windows
didnt get that in gta  now did ya
while roaming through packs of maniac looters in outrageous crowds it is your job to create as much mayhem as possible
you can either do missions or create mayhem on your ownthe coolest part of this game is that you can use body parts as weapons
thats right find a leg arm or a head on the floor pick it up and bash people to death with them
as disgusting as that sounds its actually quite humorous and entertaining
a little cartoonish in a way but still very cool
although this game is not as bad as gta  this is not a game for younger players
its very graphich and adult oriented
now is there as much freedom in this game as gta 
of course not but thats okay
the graphics are really great and the pace and loading of the game is very fast
theres so many things going on at once that it blows your mind trying to pay attention to one little thing that being good and bad
the only major disappointment is the control of the game its frustrating and very poor
its very hard to throw objects or shoot at one particular target
but besides that its still a very good game
the best mode in the game is chaos being that theres more of an opportunity for you to do whatever you want than in revolution mode
if you want some cool cheats for this game check out   theres a ton of themlike i said this is not gta  so if thats going to disappoint you then dont buy it and save yourself the whining and complaining
dont listen to the hype and play this game with an open mind
play it more than once before writing a review that bashes it
you dont have to buy it just rent it and see for yourself
despite the very poor control state of emergency is a very wild and unpredictable game that can lead to hours and hours of fun
play it for yourself before you make any decisions on itstate of emergency should be another sure fire hit from rockstar games
it is non stop chaos and violence and certainly isnt appropriate for young gamers
this game kind of reminded me of a d smash tv but the difference is you can blow up store fronts and cars in the parking garage and you have a wide assortment of cool weapons meanwhile running around in a large d environmentsoe is a little repetitive at times but it is easily a game that you can fire up and play for    minutes and get plenty of enjoyment out of especially when you dont have an hour or two to invest in a game
this game is no where near as deep as grand theft auto iii and its not supposed to besoe is a fun little d shooterbeat em up with no other quest other than kill or be killed
the graphics are great and overall its a pretty fun game
i have a good time with it and i think you will toorecommendedwow this is an awesome game
it lacks the depth of grand theft auto  but the plot is there is a revolution going on and you are in the middle of it basically
the first level is in the mall where you shoot people and pick up rather interesting things to kill people with like kegs of beer human heads and arms chairs caution signs tvs etc
its almost like final fight or fighting force gone haywire
this is a great game and its more like an arcade game than grand theft auto it has a lifemeter like  on  fighting gamesbut its fun and just as addciting
grand theft auto  and state of emergency while made by the same people and share a similar theme the games are completely different
check this game out
its worth itgraphics wise its nowhere near the quality of onimusha ico or ffx
the stores and such look rather bland
you cant even enter them so it seems lacking in that you cant raise hell inside the stores as well
however this game takes off in terms of action once youve got  or more gang memberscorporation members on your tail and you manage to pick up the shotgun or grenade launcher
theres lots and lots of weapons to pick up from tasers axes pepper spray swords aks uzis shotguns grendade launchers etc
the action gets intense as you try to accomplish your next mission while youve got bogies on your tail bystanders in the way and a loaded weapon in your hands
what to do
what to do
well anything you want
thats what
gameplay isnt very original or deep
its just basic mindless fun with replay value accomplished by trying to unlock other characters and areasfirst things firstdo not expect another grand theft auto iii
this game is very different
in fact there are only a couple of small similarities
ill get to that in a second
heres the game in a nutshellthere are two modes of play
the first mode is chaos mode
in this mode you pick your character and your area and you go cause as much damage as you can
you can play with a time limit or you can play crazy taxi style picking up time bonuses and health bonuses as you destroy and kill more and more
at times a very excited voice will tell you things you can destroy to earn extra points for limited amounts of timethe second mode of play is revolution mode
again pick a character and starting in the mall you are given missions to complete similar to gta
but the missions have not nearly the depth and variety as the missions in gta
and they get a little repetitive one of my two problems with soe
you end up doing a lot of missions which involve escorting someone to one area protecting the area while heshe performs some function and escorting them away
they can be a little monotonously difficult
but i totally suggest starting out with revolution mode to get the feel of the game
then grind into chaos mode and let loose with your newfound skills
you will have fun
i guarantee itmy only other problem is something anyone who plays the game will agree with
there is no multiplayer mode
and a game with this type of arcade feel desperately cries out for one
i can only lie back and fantasize about trying to search out and destroy a friend through the  chaotic characters running through the d maps of which there are  nicely sized onesmaps i meani love the game
i do recommend it
i disagree also with the people who say this game is harsher than gta
gta is a much more realistic violent game
soe makes a point to seperate reality from the cartooni doubt a game thats been sitting on the shelves at blockbuster for a year with a  price tag on it could be any good
its supposed to get boring quickas i said before this is a great game but i have found many problemshad to start a whole new gamelost my dragonand got a bit boredat first when i went to surdana and found a lot of people i notice that most people had looked the exactly the same except for the blacksmithqualuslady myschalagenreli forgot his nameand sorecess jadealso the villians like khesoll vole and polta looked the samesomething really buged me about this plus instead of fighting  different monsters you fought  all the samewhen at the tree in the shadowmire i noticed there was a down fall in which i had to jump or go another waywhen i jumped down something bought me up to the start menu and saved my game over the file i had saved and when i died and went back to my game i kept dieing so i had to start another gamenow dragon losesthis happened a lotfirst when i went through thee yeti tunnel arokh said hed stay right therewhen i came through another tunnel i called him and couldnt find himhe finally came after i called him for an hourthen the path to northern tundra i didnt think arokh would be able to pass through it so i left him outside the tunnelwhen i went out the other end of the tunnel i found myself to be caught in a trap with  blackwings which i couldnt targetyou cant target flyers when your rynn which stinksso i went backi came back and arokh was gone i saw his shadow but no arokh i called him and nothing happenedi fell of the cliff where i get to tundra and there was no way upand couldnt go back to the ilses because no one would led me backand i couldnt go through the portal with out arokhi lost my dragon and had to begin on my other fileits rather a bomber you can die from falling with no helpi liked the game but after seeing the same enemies over and over got me boredit was a good game and tought me to expect the unexpect and that theres something around every cornerits a good game but if you like a varties of enemies then maybe you shouldnt buy itbut if you like a chanlge like a sassy girl with magical powerand can kick butt than buy itthe chose is yours not minebut keep htis review in minedpssorry for the spelling but im a really bad spelleri heard this was a good game and it does have promise
upon reading some of the reviews here however i am wondering if some of the reviewers were playing a different game than i was
the graphics are a bit better than par for the course i do like the detailed sky scenes with the planets and all that stuff
the controls are without a doubt the games strong point with arokh and rynn being easy to expertly maneuver in combat and other tasks
the story is quite lame however as are the bad guys
the desert lords never captured my imagination and several of the bosses are no more difficult to defeat than the regular baddies in this offering
also almost each dungeon looks similar and theres only a handful of different enemies in the entire game
the villagers are no better with several people in each town being the same character model
sure the landscapes are pretty but this laughable feature took away from the game
the ending was rather weak and i had no desire to play it again
like i said the graphics are decent and the controls outstanding with some good ideas for a game but overall it has several flaws that detract from the entire packagei bought this game a few weeks ago and i enjoyed it for the most part
i love freeroaming rpgs with real time fighting similar to style to zelda
drakan is a decent game but with two minor flaws
here is the lowdown on drakan the ancients gatethe pros graphics and sound
the world in which this game takes place is huge and well detailed
the voice acting is quite well done not too hokey
each environment has its own mood and there is a diverse gang of monters for you to hack and slash you way through
storyline
this is one of the more original rpg storylines of the last while
though i will not give a plot synopsis here it should be pointed out that there are many suprises with the story
enough to keep the more seasoned rpg gamers interested
battle system
i love the real time battles that you engage in
rather than turnbased battles that appear out of nowhere you see the monsters coming and you battle them on the spot
throughout the game you can choose from a wide variety of weapons and magic spells
the battles are intense and never repetative
the best part is without a doubt when you are fighting in the air on your dragonthe cons glitches
what you read in other reviews about glitches is true this game has some graphical glitches
when you are wandering around sometimes the fighter phases out
there is some popup in both the foreground and in the background
these are scattered but happen often enough to be noticeable
others have mentioned a serious glitch where the dragon disappears
this has not happened to me so i cannot comment on that
motion sickness
there were times when the herkyjerky style of camera movement made me dizzy
this is a small thing but it forced me to turn off the game a few times
lesson learned dont sit too close to your tv when you are playingoverall i recommend this game
i love the graphics sound and overall style of this game
the flaws are minor and are unlikely to affect your enjoyment of the gameone of those unfortunate games that got killed in the reviews when released only to turn out to be great
flying the dragon is near flawless and the world is huge
caves are deep
combat is decent
monsters are convincing and the main character is very much like lara croftfive stars for fun but four stars overall because this game is glitchy
be careful
if you see a cave that can fit a dragon make sure you bring your dragon with you
otherwise you can lose your dragon forever
other than that this game is great
a must playi played the frist game on computer and loved it this came out and now i love this game the dragon riding is the best part with some role playing things here and there some times it dose slow down a bit but nothing too bad get this its like tomb raider on a dragondrakan the order of the flame was a surprisingly solid enjoyableand underrated pc title when it was released several years ago
despite this it contained some very harmful flaws
for starters the plotline never lived up to its full potential and the climax went off like a damp squib and left in its wake a certain sourness that detracted from all the glorious hacking and slashing that came before it
on top of this the games dungeon locales became repetitive very quickly due to their unceasing sameness despite the beautiful graphics enginenow there is drakan the ancients gates the playstation  sequel and one of the reasons i myself picked up the ps console
it addresses some of its predecessors issues with varying degrees of successthe pros though drakan the order of the flame is now an aging pc game the graphics are still very impressive
drakan the ancients gates has improved upon these already pleasing visuals and the results are stunning
the outdoor environments are the most stunning ive ever witnessed in a game of this type and the indoor sections of the game arent half bad either the first couple of times you see them anyways
combat is a crucial element of the ancients gates and fortunately its pretty fun
hacking through the games various beasties is quite enjoyable although your capacity to sever limbs and inflict hideous gaping wounds has been removed in this second installment
although drakan owes much to tomb raider with its sexy heroine it adds arokh the dragon into the mix to keep things fresh
taking flight is one of the games best features and dragon vs dragon dogfights can be pretty intense
the game employs some rpg elements that were missing in the order of the flame
being able to specialize in melee or magic is a nice choice and adds a fair amount to the game
drakan enjoys some very good production values
the musical score is rousing and memorable and the voice actors are all pretty good
a new actor has taken on the character of rynn and in the process injected some life into the character that was lacking beforethe cons like its predecessor the ancients gates still suffers from repetitive dungeon crawls
the caverns sewers and keeps are all rendered in an immensely believable fashion but in the end they all begin to look the same once youve been playing for a few hours
the games storyline never truly hits its stride and the ending while not as crippling as the first games which was so bad in fact that it darkened the overall gaming experience is still pretty lackluster
the games combat isnt as involving as the first games merely because it has chosen to tone down the level of violence
it depends upon your own personal outlook whether this is a good or bad thing but given how satisfactory it was to dismember an orc in part  i find it disappointing
be warned there are some very dangerous bugs lurking about in the world of drakan and im not referring to the games hordes of giant spiders
if youre not the kind of gamer who saves his or her game in more than one slot and youre looking to start drakan you had better change your ways or suffer the consequences
you see if you dismount your dragon and venture too far into another land on foot you may lose your dragon forever  and since arokh is required to finish the game this is a very bad thingall in all though the ancients gates is one of the best medieval fantasy hackandslashers you will find for the ps if not the best
i can only hope that a third installment comes along and further improves upon this charming formuladrakan is a wonderful game
the balance in graphics of a number of dark villian filled caves and flying in the beautiful colorful countryside on the back of a dragon is so much fun
the final boss was difficult but not impossible
its a good idea to purchase the healthmeter spell as soon as possible so you dont spend all of your money on health bottles and can upgrade your armor
the only improvement i would like to see in this game is the ability to refill the healthmeter without stopping and hiding out in the middle of a fightthis is a pretty decent actionrpg for ps its kinda more of a rental in my opinion though
the graphics suck the controls are a little weird and it takes up kb of space on the memory card
holy crap
drakan is still worth a try thoughlet me start by saying i love rpgs
especially the nonlinear ones like the ultima games
games like that offer a coherent interesting story
whats not so linear is all the sidequests and exploration which is what i love
this is also why i like drakan  the ancients gates so darn much
for gamers who love the freedom of exploration in rpgs this game gives you enough freedom by offering sidequests at nearly every turnthe story itself is quite solid epic mythologies and worldshaking events and its told through some excellent voice acting
oh yeh and riding arokh your draconic companion is fantastic
the controls are solid and versatile not perfect especially near the ground but very close to it
i love the heroin a scarlethaired looker whos definitely no push overi cant give this one five stars because the combat does get a bit repetitious
there could be more variation to the enemies and dungeon environments
but this definitely satisfies my desire for nonlinear mostly fun rpg playing
i couldnt stop playingand you like light rpgs this is a great game
i bought this game on a lark when i was bored and had some free time and was really surprised how good it wasthe good  great controls one of the best control schemes to come along in  awhile and a real problem in a lot of games for some reason
nice sense of open ended exploration
decent story line some nice side quests one long ongoing one that ends up giving you the best weapon in the game
great lookingplaying
some of the dialog is actually funny and most of it is pretty good
certainly way above average for this type of game
great combinationbalance of the fighting
fights happen real time there are no cut scenesturn based fights ala final fantasty etc but manages not to get terribly redundant
good balance between fightingexploring
monsters stay dead once you kill them forever you can even go back to an old level and they are still all cleared
 different skill paths to choosewell not really once you know the game but on the surface you can be either bowmagicsword and in reality a combination of  or all  of these
they all have their plus sides
my advice play thru the game once without reading any hint guides then replay and build your real characterthe bad
character developement could have been more in depth
you get one skill point to spend every level max level you can reach is  and the monsters dont respawn so there is no real way to power level beyond where the game wants you to beboth good and bad in that respect
really my only gripe with this game it ends up feeling a tad bit shallow on the character developement aspectsthe ugly
possible to lose your sidekick
if you go thru a zone on foot where you could have taken your sidekick its possible to lose him
its also possible to lose him out in the open within a level but that just ammounts to backtracking to a spot you can pick him back up
not game breaking but can be very annoyingall in all a surprisingly good game
the positives far outwiegh the negatives for me in this game
worth buying for the replay value but certainly could be done in a long rentalbecause i love the first one i had to get this one
some people say its not as good as the first and i guess i agree but this is still fun and charmingnow if its a real review you want then read ongettin straight to the pointthe verdictuppersfunny script and storyvery well animatedquality rappingnice twoplayer gamedownerstrust me this game isnt reall down im just picking hairs here
dull bonus and training bitsstill a very short gamejokes soon wear thinthe food makes you hungrysee what i mean
overall resultsgraphics  nice but youre always staring at symbolssound  good tunes enjoyable lyrics and ace rapping
lifespan  short easy but saved by twoplayer action overall score and thoughtsbetter than most rhythmaction games thanks to its jamalong twoplayer mode
the only downfalls are the shortness and the rather vague jokes
if you like this then ull love space channel give it a shot
so overall i give it get to it
pen up some smoothhitting flows because that lil freestyling pup from his  debut has returned to the ps
togged up in his claret beanie some big ol baggy pants and a pair of funky red shoes parappa the rappa must prevent his hometown from being dominated by the infamous noodle gang
suffusing burger joints with their noodles the folks at rappas town fight back to regain their beloved highinsaturatedfat heartattackcausing cow patties
okay so the third story in the series is not as charming as the first loveydovey one but hey the reasons why so many have hailed the first parappa game as a brazen title is completely unbroken third time around including um jammy lammy
parappa the rappa  simply rocks despite its lack of reconstruction or wave of advancement to its genrethe first one in the series was a landmark of beaming personality with its vivacious character designs and dainty backgrounds
its retrospective of colors and paperthin models  were something to stare upon and talk about
parappa the rappa  looks almost indistinguishably equal as the first but better
reintroducing all the attitude along with spiffier character visuals the game runs smoother and juicier with a rich audio eminence
parappas transposable charm is all rendered in the graphical ambiance as with the affluent scenarios found throughoutalthough fairly undersized in length with only eight levels parappa the rappa  tenders what previous attempts have bided
the saying if it aint broken dont fix it perfectly suits the nature of this game
basically the player must tap in specific buttons in a rhythm in simonsays style
several buttons will appear on the screen and its up to the player to correctly hit the buttons displayed or commanded
at the right bottom of the screen the players rating level determines how well the player is performing
obviously getting a good rating will advance players onto the proceeding stage
the rating ranges from the lowest of awful  to cool as the best groove
should the player mess up on the button tapping his rating will plunge from good to bad and finally awful
perfectly clocked in rhymes will have the player ascending on his rating
if the player wishes to reach cool then he must freestyle in between the commands given on screen by pushing any button as long as it goes with the flow and does not interfere with imperative commands
offering a two player battle mode and loads of buttonsmashing humor parappa the rappa  doesnt shed anything quite new but casts all the fun from as a splendid pastimeof all the elements in parappa the rappa  the return of imaginative characters and their remarkable voiceovers is unsurpassed
the music throughout the game drifts like a brilliant rap presenting an appealing and positively inane in a good way tunesin short parappa the rappa s abrupt end left me ravenous for much more play
quite possible to be finished in one sitting the game just begs for additional levels and challenge
the overall quality in the game gleams shimmers shines and what not but the quantity of the game is the weakest constituent
even with its two player battle of the best freestyling spinoff parappa the rappa s biggest quibble is the question of buying or renting it
but dont let its shortage cloud your judgment because the game is just one of those games thatll you find yourself visiting over and over
though next time around sony should flesh out a solid lineup of challenges and different play modes
boil it down and what you have is another fantastic party gameif you are going to travel with the ps this screen is an almost perfect accessory
its only major drawback is the lack of a dualsocket power inverter sold separately look for the  gamers power inverter for around 
this is ideal for long trips as it allows kids or anyone to play their favorite games and in conjunction with the ps dvd remote also sold separately get the sony version play dvds
the quot screen has an excellent picture the quot is also good but trust meavoid the quot screen
it has major resolution and color issues though adjusting to the smaller screen while playing games can take some time
dvds look sharp as good as any portable dvd player for a substantially smaller amount of money
great sound too
for anyone travelling a long distance this can be a lifesaverwhen i looked at the box of hot shots golf  i immediately thought quotkids gamequot  with goofy golfers who wear funny clothes and say stupid things i thought quotno way  show me a real game like grand theft auto  vice cityquotthen off to the left was a playstation  demo terminal as luck would have it
hot shots golf  was the game being demoed
i walked over and gave it a shotcontrary to what i thought based on the cover hsg  is a serious golf game that is a ton of fun
classic standbys like links and tiger woods seem stiff by comparison
the animated characters remind me of what quotpunch outquot did for boxing
you have tony the mafia guy spike the anxst teen joe joe cool complete with gold chains and cell phone and many many more all with their own unique swings and personalities
these characters make the game play that much more interesting and engagingspeaking of gameplay all of the important golf factors are present
wind rain hilly terrain sand traps etc  all make the game difficult enough to keep you interested for weeksits a mindless game that is a ton of fun
go get your copy todayfor me this was a compulsive buy driven by a recent rash of nostalgia
i played hot shots golf  back in  and remember enjoying it a lot
today i can still say that it is a great game so long as you play it muted
i forgot how repetative the character one liners werei have been playing golf games since the original atari and have found there are usually two types the serious ones like tiger woods and the whacky amusing ones like hot shots personally i like hot shots better
the graphics are wonderful
the characters are solid and entertaining and the caddies are passable enough
however its the gameplay that keeps you coming back for more
from playing all the way thru the tourney mode to challenging a friend in the skins competition or just playing the short course
this game has a little of everythingif you want to hurry the game along a simple press of the button right after the swing and you go straight to the end of the shot
you can play a short round in about  minutes and  holes in about  minutes this wayand the game keeps all of your stats and grades you
so the more you play the more your stats tell how you are playing each courseand believe me there is nothing more satisfying then droppping in a hole in one or two
on the short course
its not extrememly difficult to do but it aint easy eitherall in all hot shots  gives you plenty of control over your shots plenty of game options the ability to speed up the game and the graphics and characters are a joy
plus once you get used to putting it becomes pretty intuitivepure and simple i love this gamehot shots golf  the sequel to the fun and accessible hot shots  and  is a very fun golf game and easy for anyone to learn
part of the reason this game is so appealing is that you dont have to be a master before you start having fun gran turismo  was like that and the first  hours with that game was a real struggle
with hot shots golf  anyone can pick up a controller and quickly learn to play within  minutes
i even tried a round with my dad and after playing a few courses he was scoring par and birdie without much troublehowever it is not an easy game once you get going
the initial courses are fun and mildly challenging but as the game goes along the courses become thankfully harder
as goes usual golf gaming fair there are a countless number of secrets and items to unlock
you can unlock secret clubs characters wallpapers and more by earning hot shot points while you playthe only things that i didnt like about this game were the unorignal characters and the annoying sound effects
the characters are very stereotyped as usual and i would have preferred sony to use the original japanese charactersother than those two bad points hot shots golf  is a very fun golf game with a lot of longevity
there are plenty of secrets to unlock six huge  hole courses to play on and even internet scoring competition
while its not wholly original considering its another sequel its a great accessible game whether youre playing alone or with some friendsnothing like golfing with people with big heads
remember how golfing games were so simple yet fun
that is hot shots golf
forget the complexity of the tiger woods games
dont get me wrong tigers games are great
get this if you feel you need a different golf pace with maybe a smile while you tee off on the back nine
this game is fun
worth a looki just got street fighter  and needed a  button controller so i went scavenging my closet and found this old wingman controller and to my pleasant surprise it worked in win  rc bit no drivers needed
not many products have the longevity of this one
i havent as of yet gotten the rumble to work with sf
the controls feel good but not great
ive never had a pc joystick work this long especially the driversi love this thing
it plays better than any corded pad i ownprosdual analog rumble capabilities and a digital padtriggers
four of them
excellent range and its as responsive as a corded padconsbatteries
you need four of them aa i work around that by using rechargeblesits heavybefore trashing this thing due to compatability problems go to logitecs website and get the newer drivers
they fixed any problems i had with my wingmanthis is a very good gamepad
immediate benefit is not having a cord
my setup has me playing games on my tv and needing to be within a few feet of the computer to play on the tv is not good
this gives you range and versatility
easy to install and the software is rather simple to go throughin addition you can program your gamepad for virtually any game
this isnt foolproof though
i tried doing that for rtcw and i was limited to a certain range of viewability and aiming
so i couldnt play that game with it
however plenty of other games work well with itthis is a very good game i love it
the only thing i dont like is that you cant create a player but thats the only real big miss i can think of
if you like basketball games you should love this
the graphics are very good and the camera angles are not too bad either
one good thing is the replays you can go back and watch a replay in any angle and how closefar away you want the camerea
this game is a must buy unless you dont like sports games all that much then you should at least rent itthis is by far the best basketball game for any systemthe xbox has done its homework when it made this titlethis james bond game is cool but they could of made it way better than it was
i have this game already and i do have fun with it but i say things like they should of done this and this da da da
in this game they shouldnt of made james bond look different because then its not realy james bond
theres not many levels in the game but some are fun like the driving levels
those levels were a great idea
they should of had more levels like maybe  and ten of the levels should be car levels
that would be awesome
it would of been cool if you could do car races and car battles in multiplayer
in multiplayer some of the games that they have you cant do with bots like capture the flag or goldengun that was a mistake
there are only  missions
the levels should have been longer because some are to dang short
the missions in the levels are easy to figure out you dont even have to look at what your missions are
they needed more cheats like the ones from goldeneye
once you earn a cheat you cant turn it of or on it just stays on
the graphics are great like maybe a  because some things are polygon shaped
you hear the original song in almost every level which is pretty cool
in order to earn some cheats you have to score points and get these  icons
that was a good ideathis game was just to short plus the ending was cool but it shouldnt have ended the way it ended
james bond jumps out of a window and his girlfriend zoe who was pretty hot catches bond in a plane
then they fly away and its the end
on nintendocom i saw that there would be another bond game called nightfire
i hope this one will be better then agent under fire
they better have lots of stuff in that game
like more levels more level missions the real james bond who is pierce brosnan more multiplayer modes
well anyways i hope nightfire is betterthat game is ereally cool
the graphics are amazing and the textures may be a little cheesy for the skins on their face or on malpraves bouncing b but they are really nice  for thatthe voice acting is excellent with r being a old reminder of the old q the nice old man who gave bond stuff to hurt people with for that too
the music and sound effects are a little underrated compared to the voice casting
 for thosethe controls as usual with a bond game are really tight
they are easy to access althought using the cross pad for weapons and gadgets is a little flaw
 the story is as with any bond game true to its cause good but you will find the same old formulapeople dieyou go in for infoyou meet the bad girlyou meet the good girl from whom you are probably gettign nooky from at the end
you save the world and get the girl
nooky
same old same old
the single player is good but the only thing that saves this game from ahaving a zero replay value is the multiplayer which will make you play with your friends and replay the single player so you can get the awards for it
gameplay  replay value last thing the booklet
a games quality is often partly relected by its instruction booklet
in this game he booklet is good and cmpprhensive although a little bit of color would havebeen nice and some input about how to get the awards
overall this is not an average   stars
im still waiting for nightfirebut sadly not the best
the graphics and gameplay in agent under fire are fantastic but at times the game is way too easy
while this in itself is not so bothersome it does leave something to be desired once you complete the gameyou are  the agent who needs no introduction and it is your job to save the world a cliched spy plot that still works suprisingly which is done by completing various missions
what i love about this game is the diversity
in goldeneye you were almost always on foot running after and shooting baddies
in this game you can race through the streets in the bmv z or shoot enemies out of the back of your car while your sexy female sidekick drives
also included  are a variety of new toys like a laser to cut off locks or a claw to latch onto high placesthe graphics and music are stunning taking full advantage of the gamecubes abilities
the animation and cinematics are also well done and very lifelike
this is the next best thing to being bondthe flaws mentioned before are not crippling but i would have liked a little more challenge
personally i prefer goldeneye for n simply for the depth
dont listen to anyone who says buy the xbox or ps versions instead they are exactly the same game and the pros and cons apply to all versionsthis game isnt a master piece but its a good game
well i liked the weapons and the plot that involved malprave and the clones
before my friends and i played halo we played this multiplayer all the time
our favorite multiplayer game was vip it was so fun that we even killed our own vip sometimes
the campaign was also good but if you want to find out more you should play it
the thing that was bad were the graphics they were terrible even for its timeif your interested in playing this game now you probly could rent it off the gameflycom but i also have seen them at storeswhen i first played this game on the ps i had two major complaints first the horendous loading time was inexcusable for the ps when i bought the system it was under the impression that load times were a thing of the past the other was the lack of blood
goldeneye was realistically bloody and still pulled of a t rating
although i could also complain about the graphics i must also acknowledge the beautiful lip synchingthe gamecube port adresses at least one of the major complaints and while it still seems cheesy to shoot someone in the head and not draw blood it also makes the game somewhat more shild friendly i guesse its still not goldeneyethe voice acting in this game is superb as the voice actors sound very much like their movie counterparts and the storyline itself is typical bond fan fair
this game is not without its flaws colission detection can be a bit off sometimes and the control set up takes some getting used to but over all its still a lot of funnintendo gamecube also addressed the loading issue as it is lightniong quick now and barely noticable
this game is fun short but fun and a worthwhile purchase but be warned that this was a ps  game first and it shows
little was done to improve the graphics this game is far from the pinacle of gcn graphicsits not the best bond game but its good on story mode its easy and good for beginners i would recamend itthere are  james bond games in this world
theres goldeneye for the n
this plot was kill kill kill oh and when your done could you please kill these people too
tomorrow never dies for the playstation seemed to never get anywhere
it was rd person had sloppy control and i couldnt make out a storyline
the world is not enough n again was probably the most amazing n games there
agent under fire seems to follow in the world is not enoughs footsteps but takes everything twine took to the max and takes the max to the max if that doesnt make any sense dont worry because it doesnt with more gadgets guns and girls than any other  game along with the most stunning graphics out of all the  games and probably the best plot among any other  gamewhen i put the cd in to play got through the intro and got to main screen and selected select mission and pressed start i was immediately put into a mission briefing
q m and mickaloi the gadgets wiz will explain what to do when to do it and what is happening
when i pressed a and started the game i experienced a cutscene
it showed me in a car driving to a tower
then q explained my options of entering
you can use a qdecoder to glitch the lock on a door into opening or use my qclaw to climb up the wall and drop from above
i was speechless
as i went on the story develops and the game gets more and more interesting
you have  tries to complete a level if you die at certain milestone you start there until you die completely and are exited to the main screen again
the guns and gadgets are definitely more impressive
the one problem where the heck is pierce brosnon
the new james bond is some weird looking guy whom has one eyebrow up  and has this ridiculous smug grin on and his accent is anything but british
he sounds like some guy with a french mom and an irish dad and speaks with an italian accent
apart from james bond not being pierce i give the gameplay a the first thing i noticed when i turned on the game was the opening scene
if youve every seen playstation the opening scene is always in full d textures then the game starts and the graphics well plainout suck
gamecube reverses that
the actual game is more impressive than the opening
if you shoot a car with fireworks in it the fire explodes and you wont believe its fake
then you notice that the glass is falling faster than the rubber but slower than the titanium
you will then see smoke immerse the whole area and it crawls into cracks and bounces off railing
when it slowly clears youll see a scorched car
now with just that mind think of what the rest of it is like
there is no blood which i actually enjoy because it seems pointless to make it into some resident evil slaughterfest
dead bodies disappear explosives remain charcoled cars remain dented
when you hold a gun you can see the reflections of stuff on the shiny side
you would not believe what had to have gone into this
the graphics without a doubt must be a you want to know how cool the sound is
just look at the things characters say
bond is here
youre a dead man bond
over here quick
sound the alarm
my turn
bond is here
youre a dead man bond
over here quick
sound the alarm
my turn
unfortunately a lack of diverse dialogue among enemies is in this game
there are two types of voices
some girls say these things and men can say this with an american accent or a spanish accent depending on the level
bullet firing is mostly the same depending on the gun
ricocheted bullets have about  different sfx
explosions sound the same
all together its not the greatest
most bosses talk to you and m and q will say things but sometimes the same things in levels
all in all in a firstperson shooteradventureaction game you have to imagine it is hard to have so many different sfx
i feel justful in giving the sound element a in a first person shooter speed isnt everything
game speed plays a factor but in auf it runs at a good normal speed
loading time is ok it takes about  seconds to load save or start a game
what really bugs me is when you have an objective complete and it transfers you to a different place youll pause while bullets fly everywhere you cant be harmed and people are yelling until the next level starts
in the first level you press an elevator button and the game pauses and starts up again at the destination of the elevator
immediately you are open to enemy fire with little time to react
all in all i think speed deserves a good ugh
unfortunately the controls on this game kill it
unlike n  games where z conveniently located in the back of the controller where your middle finger rests is to shoot a is to open doors and b is to change while holding b then press a switches gadgets our press start to pause the game then select the weapongadget of your choice without flipping through your entire inventory these controls make no sense
the control pad not the analog stick the thing that moves around which your entire thumb could easily fit over is to change weapon and gadget
pressing left or right flips through gadgets then to use it you press b to flip through weapons use up or down then r on top of the controller pad where your index finger is to shoot
l your other index finger is to aim and z for some reason is to change modes silenced not silenced auto zoom maximum zoom auto fire single shot blast etc
and a is your action key but also automatically empties your guns barrels and puts in a new one which can cost you a maximum of half in the barrel now if your unlucky
i have to say the controlling is horrible
james bond you are the weakest controller
goodbye
 is more than fair for the controller
yuckone word rent it okay two words whatever
with a minimum of  levels which one completed there is little need to play the lengthy levels again and multiplayer is not to good you can only be against the cpu in certain games and games with human people are extremely short
you may want to try a level again to home to receive a high score then a gold medal then do it again for a platinum medal
but in the end it doesnt really add up
you wont want to replay so i give it a mere as you can see if you want a good game to play over the weekend or on a vacation just borrow it from someone or someplace
youll have as bond says in one level a barrel of fun for a few dayslets reviewgameplay graphics sound speed controls replay value total  giving james bond  agent under fire a cheats you acquire cheats by completing levels with a certain score scoring is brand new to  games and get bonuses
then play again when you have a gold medal and if you find a certain  of  medallions you get even more benefits with a platinum medal
its a very clever idea im willing to give auf  more pointsjames bond  agent under fires new total is when i first heard that this game was coming out i was a bit skeptical because ea games made it
i loved the bond for the nintendo just like everyone elsebecause it was made by rare
when i found out that bond games where going to be made by ea i was a bit dissapointed because even though ea is a good company rare made the game so great i didnt think that is could get any betterthis game has its upsides and its downsides
lets start out with the upsides
the game looks great
the graphics are very stunning while you are playing the game
the cutsceens are also magnificent looking and it is almost like you are playing a movie
the sound is also quite nice
the gun shots and people voices sound great
the multiplayer is also pretty fun but there arent many modes to play and you can only have four total shooters at a timecomputer and people
the downsides of the game arent noticeable right away but you will know what im talking about after playing the game awhile
the controls are a bit odd and takes awhile to get used to it
also the way your gun shoots is odd
you can see the bullets going almost like they are in slow motionthis is a great game and the best firstperson shooters on the gamecube
this game is definetely worth a rental for anyone
even thought it may not be a perfect dark it is still a good gamethis was my first  game
its great and just challenging enough so you can beat it and have a hard fun time
the missing star
two player
the levels are tiny and there arent enough options
nightfire hits on twoplayer
the one player action is unbeatable and great graphics to boot
great job creating a new plot and not basing it on the moviedont get me wrong or anything this game is great but i think the camera moved a little too much
i was however displeased with the firstperson view i think this should be an option rd or st person view
i played the game for about  minutes and i started to get dizzy and nausea set intoday i traded the game in because i wasnt going to play this knowing i would get sick
i took the game to gamestop and got a good tradein valuesorry i didnt get that far i completed two missions and had to stop
but i gaurantee youll love the gameplay
some people dont get sensitive to certain movements but i do
i was so excited to get this game i hated to trade iti recommend this game to all serious video gamersps
be forewarned the guy at gamestop said he and alot of people get motion sick playing this gamei would say rent it first if you know you get motion sickwe all remember goldeneye for the n
but this is fantastic
the story plot is very well done and the multiplayer is awesome
i was desperately in need for an fps to go with my gamecube library
so i found out about  and tried to earn money for it as soon as i could
this is my second favorite gamecube game
my first is ssbm obviously
this game has a very good story plot and very nicely done graphics
you will love james bonds next adrenaline video game adventurethe only reason this game doesnt get the  star rating is because it gives me motion sickness every time i play it
but the game is so good that its worth getting nauseous
bond is back and better than ever
the weapon selection is simply put the best ever on any bond game the levels are challenging but not frustrating and with a little bit of thinkingimagine that
most people will be able to figure out the objectives on their own
the graphics are stellar as is the gameplay which makes this game a must have for role playing freaks
this is the best game out there for gamecube buy it along with a box of dramamineif youre like me and you will have hours of fun to come
recommendedthe james bond series has done very well in its conversion to computer games
how well did agent under fire do on the gamecubeim a huge james bond fan
i love the movies
i mix up the martinis when i watch my dvd collection at home
i have all the console games based on the game
so i had high hopes for the gamecube version of this muchloved franchise
while the game was fun it didnt have quite the thrill of some of the other games in the seriesthe graphics are great
and the special gadgets they have are great
but you can get through the game in just a few hours and the multiplay in this game just arent as good as in previous games
the gadgets are few and far between
your qlaser works on some items but not on many that it should
your qclaw seems sort of particular about what it will grab onto
you should be able to shoot out the cameras  but often you cant
you shoot guys in the neck and they go running around yelling because theyre somehow still aliveyes the games fun
i love  games and this one has the graphics the guns the cars the babes
the characters and the theme music are there
the missions are well laid out you have options on how to complete them you can find hidden objects and secret areas
still its not the best bond game in the serieshave a lot of fun playing it and when youre done with it which wont be long pass it along to a friendokay so
ive played the first couple levels of the famed goldeneye beat agent under fire and am on level  on everything or nothing
i will tell you right now this is not the best bond game
but this is certainly not the worst
this is an excellent fps full of excitement and challenging gameplay
the only reason for my  star instead of  is that bond isnt recognizable hes not an icon like brosnan or connery or moore
hes generic
in fact if it werent for the occasional one liner or the great bond score it could pass as a another game altogether
in the end this is an incredible gaming experience and should not be passed up but if you want true bond feel try everything or nothinggameplay graphics sound characters level design difficulty moderateoverall ai was very disapointed withe this game
i think it would have been a hole lot better if mgm would have gave the licencing for the game to rare again instead of ea
the last good james bond game i played was golden eye for the n
the controlls on this game are bad the game play is horrible the only good part of this game is the car chasesthats it
all in all this game was definatly stern not shaken cause it really is a horrible tribute to the name james bondps
shame on you nintendo for selling your rare shares to microsoftmikefor the money youll pay i would highly recommend this game
it is a solid shooter with only a few minor problemsit has many different levels so there is no shortage of variety
there are many types of guns and several gadgets
the real fun comes in the form of the driving and rail shooting levels
there is one level that puts you in the drivers seat of an aston martin db and you race through the streets of budapest
your car comes equipped with all manner of cool weapons including rockets for taking out enemy cars and missiles for taking out enemy helicopters
that level also features a rail shooting area where you are in a soviet tank armed with a cannon and a chain gun
this is my favorite level of the gamethe regular walk around levels are pretty good as well
the enemies in my experience seem to be a little dumb
you can walk right up behind them and pop em off before they even know youre there
like many shooters you might not feel the need to play it very often but for the price youll likely pay you dont have to feel bad about getting itlast word agent under fire is a fine shooter in particular if you dont want massive blood and guts
the victims fall down without any sign of a wound and disappear in a few seconds
there is a good selection of levels and weapons and many different things to do after you finish the last level for example i believe there are other levels you can unlock if you obtain all the golden rewards
im not sure though
i cant comment on the multiplayer feature having never played itout of the many bond games i played this one ranked up there with the best
i wasnt too sold on the guy that did the voice of  in this game since he sounded like he had a head cold but it was still a great game
the multiplayer was one of the best partsi just got this game yesterday
dont start saying oh than he hasnt played it enough to right a real review because ive been playing this game for about  hours its so phatthe gameplay is simple
its basketball
you know when you see nba youll be receiving the best in basketball
the court is smaller than a real basketball court but it works perfectly
there are bunch of different courts you win when you play at certain places
the coolest thing is the gamebreaker
you hold lr and press b and you do this awesome move
it can be recieved by getting your point meter up
you get points for doing cool tricks to evade ball stealing or get around people plus cool shooting moves like butter alleyoop or pump fakes
the game is played to  one point is awarded for dunks or inside the point line and  points for outisde the  point line whether you shoot it and it goes in or you pass from outside the line to a person to create the alleyoop
you must win within  points though
there are many different types of ways to play
there is like a season almost
you pick a team battle about  teams
after each team is beaten you are allowed to take one of the players or award  points to everyones stat meter
after the  teams are beaten you accept a street challenge
it is not a basketball team just people who go and play you
if you beat them you get their court and there best player
the only problem here is the limied p version
even n games were able to withstand p action during basketball games such as showtime
with the slight problem the gameplay still gets a the graphics will blow you away
everyone looks almost real
they have almost near perfect character dipictions with correct hights too
instant replays will make all your friends be going
oooohh
did you see that
and when you do a gamebreaker the rim explodes almost
when you win the game and perform a dunk you do a rim breaker where you just smash and break the net rim and backboard
its crazy
gameplay definitly deserves a during sports games the sound is more like the commentary
and this commentary bites
the guy talks all ghetto and it gets real annoying
most of the time he says the same stuff
on the court is okay the basketball bounces the feet squeak and they have cool sfx for special moves and stuff
because of the commentary nba street gets a  for soundwhen i say speed i dont mean how fast kobe is dribbling down the court
im talking loading time
the game isnt very impressive in loading time like madden
you wait too long for a little matchup than i think is normal
it is definitly not as fast as the other games
the speed gets a the controls of as simple as they can get
a to pass b to shoot x to steal and y to jump
you can goaltend all you want in this so y comes in handy
your guy moves how you tell him too no questions asked
the controls get a the replay value is sick
you can play this all day and never get bored
p matches or play a season and win more and more stuff
replay value definityl gets a basically street is the best basketball game on the gamecubelets reviewgameplay graphics sound  speed controls replay value total  giving nba street a  giving it a slightly above average gamemost games have that cheat menu when you select three icons and move your control pad in a certain direction
there are  icons but all the codes stink
they can only hurt you
only unlimited turbo is helpful
anything else works againts you or merely makes the game weirder like different color basketballs or jerseys
ill add an extra nba streets new total is  giving it a if youre looking for fast paced arcade style basketball thats not mindless and retarted like many midway titles then check this game out
any one who likes the realistic basketball titles with accurate teams players etc
should avoid this game and buy nba k insteadtiger woods pga tour  for playstation  is the best golf game on the market
this game makes you feel that you are really on the course facing some of the best golfers on the tour
there are real tour courses such as peble beach tpc sawgrass and many more
the quottiger challangequot mode is great
as you get deeper into this mode you begin to unlock players such as stuart appleby brad faxon vijay singh and many more
there is another mode called quotspeed golfquot  this is a twoplayer mode where its a race to the hole
this is a pickup and go golf game like no other
this is probably my personal favorite gamei have never stepped foot on a golf course
i couldnt tell you all the rules and i dont watch it on tv
why did i rent this game
i read some positive reviews and i figured this game could be played over and over without getting boringits all true
the game is very addicting
i am essentially learning this game but i love the fact that i didnt beat the game in one day
thats always the best part of any game
can you come back and play it again  months later and be interested
this game has great replay value
it seems pretty straightforward to learn the controls
putting is a bit of a mystery to me as i can never seem to get long putts to dropall in all if you nongolfers want to play something fun a different this is a very good gamewhen it comes to sports games there are two campsthose who want a pure simulation game that is completely realistic and those who want a pickupandplay arcade game with crazy moves and unrealistic physics
ea sports usually makes games that appeal to the former group but i think tiger woods pga tour  appeals to both sides
this game can be as simple or as deep as you want it to be
there are plenty of options
there is a great single player career mode where you play against pros for money to build your golfers attributes
you can also get monney by playing through special scenarios like shooting as low a score as possible on three par  holesthere are also some great twotofourplayer options
you can play a straight golf game a skins game or the new speed golf where you actually have to run from where you hit the ball to where it landsi think what i like most about this game is its innovative controls
unlike most golf games where you just press a button a couple of times to swing the club these controls actually simulate a real swing
you pull back on either analog stick to pull the club back then press it forward to swing
you can control the distance by how far you pull back on the analog stick
you can also make the ball fade or draw by pulling the stick back at an angle
these controls really set the game apart from the other golf games out theremy only complaint about the game is that while the  version of this game has a lot more courses and options than the  version the first game had better gameplay
in the  version you could choose where you wanted to hit the ball then there would be a meter showing you how far back you had to pull
in this game it will tell you to swing a certain percentage and leave you to guess how far to pull back
also in the first game you could actually see the slope of the green to determine where to aim your putt
in this game you have to rely on a caddy tip that will tell you to aim a certain length right or left or short or long
not too helpful if you have no way of measuring the distance on the green
these gameplay quotimprovementsquot can make for some very frustrating timesoverall however this game can be pretty fun
its even better if you have a friend or two to play against
sitting around waiting for a computercontroller golfer to play can get boring after awhileexcellent graphics on tiger woods pga tour  best visuals ive yet to see on a golf game on any system
ocean surf pounding the rocks off pebble beach beautiful desert buttes on copper canyon birds chirping and flying by trees sway one at a time as if a breeze is really touching them one by one cameras following the speeding golf ball on its flight path over stunning hills and caverns
no swing meter  innovative and thanks to ea sports for taking that step
sure its a bit tough to get used to at first but once you get the hang of it the old swing meter on every other golf game seems archaic
six courses also included are the famous sawgrass and royal birkdale and tigers dream course that needs to be unlocked hole by hole with each victory
one of these days ill get to create my own course its an option
the speed golf option is downright fun but obtaining bronzesilvegold medals is nearly impossible
this sim also features a practice mode where you can visit select courses stroke play match play and skins
announcers are good and fairly low key and i appreciate them trying not to add humor to my bad shots
three things i dislike about this game  where is the save button
it is insane to have to play all  holes before being able to save your game  the repetitive triple wave in the early matches after a good shot by tiger or any of the other golfers and  hitting the power stroke could have been easier  its awkward having to swing the club with either thumb back and forth and repeatedly hit the l button for power its a coordination thing
ive found that playing a round on just about any of the courses will take  minutes this includes some time to hit the replay button on your best shots
listen to your heart i dont care what my young teenage kids say its boring
you dont have to be a sports fan or even a golfer to enjoy this game but by other ps games standards this game is kind of dull there is no killing of any kind no skateboarders no running things over with your car no knife thrusts no kickboxing moves no bombs exploding
its a realistic golf sim period
its as relaxing as it is stressful just like the real game of golf
addictive
fun
huge replay value
note hole  on copper canyon a short par  got my first holeinone here and a special ball and  cash to go with it
super shots will get you more money to go buy more attributes to improve your golferthis game has incredible graphics
fantastic courses to play
interesting concept in which as you win money you quotbuyquot attributes to improve your game
the real big downside is putting
it is mostly a guessing game
you cannot determine slope of green and you rely on a quotcaddy tipquot to help you align your puttthis has been proven by someone other than me to in many cases to be wrong therefore your putting is inaccurate
one other fault i found with the game is the perfectionism of the golfers
some seem to play the same whole exactly the same way each time you play
almost like playing against a recorded game
all in all very fun very realistic
very frustrating well then again thats golfi normally dont like triple plays series
but i rented this seasons and liked it lot
the control is much better than allstar baseballs though the graphics are not as good
i like how you use the analaog stick to control where you through to
i also like the home run derby modei do however wish that this game had a franchise mode
in my opinion this is better than allstar and high heat baseball but id wait until i play mlb  before i buy thisthis game is the best gba pinball game so far
now that the gameboy advance sp is out you can totally see everything on the board
the graphics and gameplay is done superbly
highly recommended
buy this gamethis is a perfect example of an area where the gba shines and the backlit screen of the sp model does it great justice
its a cross of pinball and the arcade shooter house of the dead
you kill zombies walking around a pinball machine with the ball
its easy to learn fast fun
good for a  minute break or an hour of smash em up time killing
the game is a little dark for the normal gba but the sp handles it very well
the graphics are good and i liked how the zombies explode into a bloody mess
its violent pinball and very twisted and fun
i could see goth kids screaming finally a game made for me
i really liked it
it was as if rob zombie and marilyn manson made a video gamepinball of the dead is a strange combination of a modern day pinball machine and the house of the dead arcade shooter
the graphics and design are stunning and the gameplay is good toothere are  different machines to play and they are all pretty different from each other
before you shoot any ball you get to shoot a zombie via roving cross hairs
hitting the zombie will net you some type of bonus like multipliers or lost ball kickbacksetcwithin each machine not really levels there are the standard pinball sequences to hit like spelling out words to get big bonuses
more interestingly though is the house of the dead flair
all kinds of zombies are roaming the table
if the ball is going slow enough the zombies can deflect the ball
if the ball is going fast enough it squishes the zombies in a great big splat of green goo color is configurablethere are also special zombie battles and boss battles
the zombie battles are engaged by squishing a bunch of zombies and then dropping the ball in a hole
this will take you to a minigame in which you have to squish a variety of flyingrunningfloating zombiesthe boss battles are even better
by engaging the right combination of table features hitting areas balls in holes etc you can cause a boss to rear hisugly head in the middle of the table
your immediate task of couse is to pound his ugly mug with the ball until he diesgoes awayof the  tables i like the rd one the best has hands for flippers although the nd table has this neat pulsating heartmolecule thing that growschanges as your ball rides the rails around it as well as a nd level area with extra flippers underneath the main table that see via a glass window in the main table
the first table is good too although i seem to have difficulty getting the ball out of the bottom area and up into play
the nd table is definitely the hardest to playgame play is good
flipper action is accurate as is ball motion
note you have to use nudge to be good at this game
the other note is that pinball tables are vertical and the gba sp screen is horizontal which makes for a bit of machine controlled scrolling
there are plenty of times that you ball will drop between the flippers too quickly because the scrolling is not fast enough to keep upall in all this is an addictive game with a broad area to explore
the unlockable elements just add to the explorationthis is a game definitely worth owningwell the game balances out to be worth the money if you actually like pinball
of course it doesnt really compare to real pinball but still not a complete waste
graphics were done well things are taken directly fromt the arcade game and dont show with slow down or grainy voicesonly complaint with the game is that you get unlimited tilt usebecause it doesnt do a damn thing to the ball in motion
the final outcome of this game is that if you enjoy pinball its worth the money to find it
if you are unsure about how enjoyable to find pinball dont buy a pinball game altogetherthose of you craving a pinball game with an added bit of replay value should look no further than pinball of the dead for the gba
an oddball game derived from segas arcade and dreamcast hit series house of the dead another oddball hod game is typing of the dead for dreamcast you play pinball on different zombie themed boards
sound effects are taken from the house of the dead series and sound surprisingly good on the gba while the graphics are much better than i expected and are sharp and nicely rendered
the gameplay is pretty much straightforward pinball action with side boss battles thrown in as bonuses
the controls respond well but more time could have been spent on the boss battles most of them are too similar to each other
all in all if your looking for a good game in the recent wave of gba titles pinball of the dead is a good pickupin the video game world its not such a great idea to mix celebrities with softwaredont ask why
the s band journey had their on video game along with wu tang clans wu tang shaolin style fighting game and then theres aerosmiths godawful revolution x shooing gallery game that was so frustrating and the music was so horrible that you wanted to stick ballpoint pens in your eyes and ears
flash forward to  where thq tries to compete with its opponent konamis dance dance revolution arcade hit by staging a celebrity dance battle
and putting who as the host
none other than popsinger superstar britney spearsin thqs britneys dance beat players will get the opportunity to play a backup dancer for britneys upcoming tour
the idea puts migrane through my head just thinking about it
many people have mixed reactions to spears taste in music and stylemany think shell be the next madonna or janet jackson while others think shes just a teenage girl who pronces around in a bra and thong with a snake and declares im a slave  u lipsyncing to the words
the propagnda states live out your fantasies becoming a backup dancer for britney spears
first of all most peoples fantasies mostly guys about britney arent about dancing with her
this is the type of video game for people that even like disapointting themselves in their own fantasies
now im not saying this was a bad game
actually it was pretty entertainingfor people that dont have dance dance
you pick from a selecton of dancers and go through tryouts
if you succeed you become a backup dance for her next concert
but there is some competiton from other dancers
in due time through out the game you unlock secret videos and concert clips that are at least somewhat intresting being that youre probably out of breath from the jumping you had to do the game is compatible with sonys dance pad for psone or thumb cramps from the constant pushing you had to exicute
you pretty much dance to every song she does including im a slave  u oops i did it again stronger and others
its a pretty average dance game but the extra star instead of  stars is because i a fan of britney believe it or not
adiosmy daughter just bought this game with her own money shes  and the first complaint is i think this game is over priced
however if you are a britney fan then youll probably enjoy this
the next complaint is that there is only  songs to choose from
there shouldve been at least  songs and there should be elevating levels with more difficulty
the most difficult part is when the symbols x o square amp triangle start to change move and some even have the left right up down arrows to coincide with them
i found that adding the arrows with the symbols blew me away as i wasnt expecting it when i played against my daughter its not that difficult to throw me for a loop
with that said it is still a fun game with music limited and if your child is a britney fan your child will probably love it
but again it is way over priced in my opinion and i would shop around for some good pricesthis will probably get brushed off as another cheap game but it is not hal bad
you play one of six characters in a ontest to be a backup dancer on a britney spears concert
just follow the directions on the circle and youll be finethis is on of the better music simulators to come around in a long while
its only rival is dance dance revolution
parappa the rapper is a dull game same goes for  its lame sequel
half the stuff mtv releases is dull
so this game in whole stands out on its own
a rental at leastmy little cousin gave me this game since he didnt really play it that much at all
i tried the first few levels and i was hooked
basically you experience the one year war through the perspective of the principality of zeon
so instead of piloting a gundam guntank or guncannon you get to pilot the zeon mobile suits zaku i zaku ii gouf and dom
this game is kind of like quotrainbow sixquot but with giant robots so fans of that game should get this one
anyway you play each mission with  or  groups and each group could have up to three mobile suits numbering up to  mobile suits at once
however the safety in numbers routine wont always help because sometimes the enemy earth federation outnumbers your team by a longshotthere are  missions in this game and almost as many trainingsimulation missions
sometimes the simulations can be more difficult than the real missions
three of the simulations are almost impossible to beat the first is when you must destroy the gundam piloted by amuro ray
the gundam is far too powerful to face headon so the best way to beat him is to make all the team members surround the gundam or attack it all at the same time get behind it while it faces your teammates and take him out with a well placed bazooka shot or heat hawk slash
make sure that all your team leaders arent killed in missions or youll fail
the second hard simulation is when you have to destroy the gouf piloted by lieutenant ramba ral who is guarded by countless zakus magellas and missile turrets
the third one is when you have to destroy the black tristars piloting their doms which are practically unstoppable
this game follows the gundam series and you see how certain incidents in the series affect zeon and your team like the death of captain garma zabi the battles against the trojan horse and the invasion of jaburo
the gameplay is great and controlling giant mechs is certainly outstanding so go ahead and buy this game whether youre a gundam freak giant robot fan or cooperative game player
although some missions are almost impossible dont give up if i can do it you might be able to do iti know little about the squad based games genre but i do know that this game is very fun
i can not understate how fun it is to obliterate an enemy mobile suit
it is just as satisfying as blowing up zombie heads in resident evilthe graphics and presentation are solid and the best of the franchise yes even superior to certain nextgen gundam gamesthat said the gameplay is far from perfect for instance you get more points for sneaking up on your enemy
i repeat you receive more points for being stealthy while piloting  foot tall robots it makes you wonder what was going through bandais head
the radar sonar and thermal sensors dont seem to meaningfully contribute except randomly and when looking directly at the enemy
lastly it needs more mobile suitsoverall a fun game with a few issuesthis game is a rts real time strategy
it is most often not the best thing to run up and start a battle with the enemies
and that is what i like about it
it requires some stealth
for instance is the enemy is just standing there looking the way that he is guarding you and walk up and if you are in range attack him from behind before he really knows what hit him
the graphics for the mechs are great but the environments could use some work
it is very fun getting all of the new mechs which in turn have new weapons
you have the option to create your own path because the one that is already set is rarely the best one
i never did this because i really wouldnt have known what to do
this is one of the best gundam games to date
this and side story are the best ones
i dont really follow the gundam anime series but i love fighting as huge mechs
so you dont have to be a gundam fan to really have some fun with this gamezeonic front is different
its not quite as freeroaming as one might come to expect from journey to jaburo or fed vs zeon if youve played those
it focuses more on tactics as you only control one of three squads at a time completing missions that require coordination and a bit of planning
you cant just run around guns ablazin as some games let you
however dont let that stop you from trying it
its very fun and challenging
not for those looking for quick thrills
its slower paced than most games from the gundam franchise
the game has a variety of missions as you play through the games story mode
there is also a side mission mode where u play standalone missions completing various objectives and get graded on performancethe mechs range from zakus up through doms along with some unique types
the game play takes into account many realistic properties like sound offering ways to silence your guns for example to modify gameplay and out smart the computer
plenty of replay value and fun for all to have
only downside is the controlsresponsiveness can at times be a little laggy
in summation if youre on the fence about getting zeonic front remember zeon thirsts from the strength of its people so give it a shot
hail zeonfirst off i love racing games
they are fun you need to think quickly at times you can play with more than one player usually and those winner by a nose finishes make it all worth iti get this all from this game
ive really enjoyed playing this game and building up my character while trying to unlock other characters to play with
each course is imaginative and has its own sets of challengesmy only problem is that it can get easy really quickly
i wish there were a way to download courses off the internet or an ability to create your ownbut in the end if you like racing games i would highly recommend this oneunlike most people i owned the pc version of the original racer and i absolutely loved it
even before i had seen the movie i was deeply obsessed with that game
theres nothing coller that racing inches above the ground and near sonic speeds
the sequel offers everything the first offers with a couple of exceptions and a lot of extrasfirst my few complaints there seem to be fewer tracks on fewer planets offering less variety
basically you get the water planet mon calimari the desert planet tatooine the jungle planet gamorra sounds like a venereal disease and my least favorite world the planet with one side day and the other night which was my favorite and maybe one other
maybe my memroy hypes the pc version into something better than it was but it seems that there were a lot more planets or at least a lot more tracks
lack of variety in the tracks means the game is potentially very short even though replayability is goodmy other problem might seem trivial but theres no first person perspective without the pods in view
it was my favorite view on the first one for a couple of reasons
  the pods obstruct your view even thought theyre meant to make a more realistic simulation
its hard to see the upcoming turns and the guys in your way
  without the pods it really increases the illusion of speed
it just sucked you in and made you feel like you were hauling other than these two minor complaints this is an excellent game
there are tons of racers both old and new including an older nonjake lloyd anakin with a redesigned pod
ive already beat the game once with teemto pagalies and have every racer through sebulba  i think there are more but ill get to that laterthe music and sound as with most star wars games is excellent
sebulbas pod still makes that cool thumping noise and the john williams score is well john williams
the visuals are very impressive especially the characters and pods
it seems like the backgrounds are a little rough and blocky at times but i think thats to improve the framerate and youre going so fast you dont have time to stop and lookone of the cool features you can unlock is the art gallery
in the gallery there are all the pods plus three that i find particularly interesting a pod for watto one for darth maul and one for darth vader
in the credits there are voice acting credits for darth maul and vader voices
it seems obvious that there is some way of unlocking these pods but i dont know how and im dying to find out
those maul and vader pods look ruthlessthe game is a lot of fun and made me remember why i loved the first one so much
theres something very cool about hitting turbo in a big underwater tube and letting the centripical force carry you upside dwon over your opponents at  mph
or bursting out of one tunnel into a cavernous gap and after some mad hangtime flying into another tunnel waaay on the other sideeven without the star wars theme this is a strong game that stands on its own
star wars fans or fans of high speed racing should not miss outi got this game because i enjoyed the version that was on n awhile back and this is just as good if not betterthe upgrade to ps technology has significantly increased the sense of speed this thing has
its scary sometimes speedy around at  some mph dodging cliffs and other racers very fun
the levels are mostly great
with huge jumps cool tunnels you can go  degrees in and some very cool shortcuts
but theres also little torches and corners your pod racer doing  mph will stop dead when it hits them its very irritating having to go around a stupid torchthe computer ai is ok as you pass them they will try and ram you
and often suceed at it which can get very annoying
its not a really hard game though they provide only an often irritation
ive won many races by just holding the boost in the last straight away and going from last to firstneedless to say i have had a lot of fun playing this game
the sense of speed is awesome and theres alot of great tracks
its a little easy and short but still very worthy of a rent or even a purchase
just dont expect it to be gran turismo with pod racerscons its a star wars gamepros its made by the team that made the atv offroad fury seriesits a   look at the way you want tothe sims now rules the pc unquestionably
the sims vacation respectably adds to its success
this isnt a great expansion but it makes the sims more fun and colorful
it also expands the somewhat claustaphobic neighborhood and downtown areas
vacation island seems huge in comparison to the other two
a neat feature to vacation is that you can go on vacation to a winter wonderland
in simsville the town seems like summer all year
no snow whatsoever
now there is snow fights snowboarding and snowy trees
also making the game fun are the beach and campground areas
these are good but i think the snowy region is the best
maybe thats because i live in colorado but youll like this addition too
new objects walls and the ability to build a hotel franchise adds to the fun
however the hotels blow
for one thing you are the only guests that stay overnight
thats kind of creepy really
however if you liked the original sims then you will be in no disappointment when you get this great addonfor me the game thakes a long time to loadbut the game is sooooooo cool but all you parents they kiss where its inopropeat so kids under the age  shouldnt play the game they have about  lots  becareful when you do go on a trip because you might of hade a lot of money but when you come back you wontfinally an expansion pack that is worthy of the sims the greatest game of all time
vacation brings life back into the sims in a huge way
i couldnt even estimate the amount of hours that my girlfriend and i have spent playing the sims over the past couple of years
i have to admit that i was somewhat disappointed in hot date simply because i think that i was expecting more than it actually delivered
vacation however brings all of the expansions together and makes the game more fun than ever before
i absolutely love taking the family out of town for the weekend
the new objects also make for incredible building opportunities or simple addonsobviously i am a fan of the sims and do have all of the expansions for the game
the special thing about vacation is that it opens up such a wide variety of activities for your sims
i personally like the snowboarding and snowball fights where my girlfriend can go metal detecting for days in sims time
the cloning options are also practically endless for all of the people who like to create their own objects
all in all i think that vacation is the best expansion since livin large
of all of the pros to this particular expansion i have personally found only one con and that is the load time
i have noticed that since i installed vacation my game loads considerably slower than it had before
for this reason alone i gave the game four satrs instead of five
i highly recommend this expansion to anyone who likes the simsif you truly love the sims then buy this expansion pack
and even if you like the sims buy it
but if you havent been thrilled with the past expansion packs then you wont be with this eithervacation provides a new way to meet people and spend time but there are several set backs
if something goes wrong on your area of vacation while a family is there you have to send the entire family back home and fix it then bring em back
people will wander into your hotel room uninvited
if you ask some one from a different family on vacation with you theyll never go to the bathroom or do anything that you want them to do because you cant control thembut it is fun
you can play games for tickets and turn them in for prizes then display them in a case
kids can finally get different pajamas and bathing suits
plus the people you meet on vacation island have real last names not just townie like in hot date
i like it and its a good addition to the game series
